# The Evolution of Banks and Markets and the Role of Financial Innovation  

“Finance is wholly different from the rest of the economy.”  

# GLOSSARY OF TERMS  

Bank-Based Economies Economies where funding (credit) comes primarily from banks in the form of loans, and investors allocate a large share of savings as deposits in banks.  

Commercial Letter of Credit A payment guarantee conditional upon successful delivery of goods or services by a seller. A financial institution that issues a commercial letter of credit guarantees that the seller of the goods and services is paid even if the buyer fails to make payment.  

Financial-Market-Based Economies Economies with a financial system that relies predominantly on the financial market for the allocation of credit. Compared to bank-based systems, corporations depend more on funding directly through the financial markets and investors allocate more of their savings to investments rather than bank deposits.  

Relationship Banking The provision of financial services by a financial intermediary that invests in obtaining customer-specific information with the expectation that this information will be used over multiple transactions. The bank develops a relationship with the borrower that often generates proprietary and qualitative (“soft”) information, and it leads the bank to evaluate the profitability of the customer across products and over time, as opposed to on a single product or transaction in a single time period.  

Securitization A process of pooling assets and then selling differentiated liquid claims against the cash flows generated by the asset pool.  

Soft Information Information that is more qualitative and based on judgment, hence difficult to quantify.  

Transaction Banking The provision of financial services with a focus on individual transactions based on readily quantifiable (hard) information.  

# INTRODUCTION  

In Chapter 3 we explained how a financial system fosters economic growth. This chapter further elaborates on the financial system and its links with the real economy focusing on the relationship between banks and markets. Financial innovations and the recent growth of the financial sector are central parts of this discussion. We also address the differences between the Anglo-Saxon market-based financial systems found in the United States and the United Kingdom and the bank-based financial system that is common in continental Europe.  

# FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT  

Why does financial development matter for economic growth? In a frictionless world in which there are no informational asymmetries or transaction costs, financial development is uninteresting in the sense that it has little effect on economic growth. In such a world, there are no impediments to optimal resource allocation, so real resources can be efficiently allocated without the assistance of financial institutions and financial markets. In a sense, this takes us all the way back to Chapter 3  where we discussed the conditions under which financial intermediaries add economic value. We need similar conditions for financial development to matter for economic growth. That is, financial development matters because of economic frictions, and financial development mitigates their effects by lowering the cost of capital and increasing access to capital for individuals and companies.
