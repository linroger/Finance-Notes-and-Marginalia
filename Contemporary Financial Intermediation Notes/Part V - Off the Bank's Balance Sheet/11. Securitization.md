# Securitization


Definition

[[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|Securitization]] pools assets and repackages them into interest-bearing securities.

[[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|Securitization]] is the financial alchemy of taking not-easily- or nontradable assets, pooling them together, and selling tradeable shares in that pool to investors. Broadly, [[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|securitization]] could be taking any assets, as with bitcoin or ether for crypto exchange-traded funds or properties and related assets for real estate [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] trusts, and [[Short Selling|selling securities]] related to them.

However, we focus here on its primary meaning for investors and regulators: when an issuer designs a marketable financial instrument by merging financial assets, normally mortgage loans and consumer or commercial debt. Investors who buy these securities receive the principal and interest payments for the underlying assets.

We'll take up the nuts and bolts of how [[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|securitization]] works, exploring its mechanics through a step-by-step example. We'll examine the potential benefits [[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|securitization]] offers to both lenders and investors, such as improved [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]], risk diversification, and more [[An Introduction to Equity Markets|efficient capital allocation]]. Meanwhile, we'll grapple with the significant risks and downsides of [[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|securitization]], including reduced transparency, misaligned incentives, and the potential for systemic instability.
## How Securitization Works

In [[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|securitization]], the company or the originator that holds the assets determines which assets to remove from its balance sheets. A bank might do this with mortgages and personal loans it no longer wants to service or raise capital for additional loans.

This gathered group of assets is now considered a [reference [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reference_asset.asp#:~:text=A%20reference%20asset%20is%20an,or%20other%20debt%2Dbacked%20security.). The originator then sells the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] to an issuer who creates tradable securities with a stake in the assets in the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]]. Investors buy the new securities for a specific rate of return and effectively take the position of the lender.

Take the Next Step to Invest

[[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|Securitization]] allows the original lender or creditor to remove assets from its balance sheets to underwrite additional loans. Investors profit as they earn a rate of return based on the associated principal and interest payments made on the underlying loans and obligations by the debtors or borrowers.

### Important

[[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|Securitization]] frees up capital for originators and promotes [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] in the marketplace.

## Steps In Securitization

[[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|Securitization]] is a complex process that involves several steps:

1. **Asset origination**: The process begins with a lender, such as an [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] bank, issuing loans to borrowers. These loans can be in business lines of credit, mortgages, auto loans, credit card receivables, or other types of credit.
2. **Create asset pools**: The lender selects a pool of loans with similar characteristics, such as loan type, maturity, and [[Wellman Inc the Importance of Loan Covenants|credit quality]]. This pool of loans will serve as collateral for issuing securities.
3. **Create the [[Collateralized Debt Obligations|special purpose vehicle]] ( [SPV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spv.asp) )**: The lender establishes a separate legal entity called an SPV) or a special purpose entity. The SPV is designed to be bankruptcy-remote, meaning that if the lender goes bankrupt, the assets held by the SPV won't be affected.
4. **Transfer the assets**: The lender sells the pool of loans to the SPV, effectively removing the assets from its balance sheet. In return, the SPV pays the lender for the assets, often using funds raised from issuing securities.
5. **[[Class Note On Securitization(1)|Tranching]]**: The SPV divides the pool of loans into different risk classes, known as tranches. Each tranche has a different level of [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds|risk and return]], catering to different investor risk appetites. The tranches are typically considered senior, mezzanine, and junior (or equity).
6. **[[Class Note On Securitization(1)|Credit enhancement]]**: The SPV may use various [[Class Note On Securitization(1)|credit enhancement]] techniques to make the securities more attractive to investors. These can include over-collateralization (i.e., putting more collateral in the pool than the value of the securities issued), reserve accounts, or third-party guarantees.
7. **Rating**: The SPV hires [[[Moody's Lessons From the Crisis|credit rating agencies]]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/09/history-credit-rating-agencies.asp) to assess the creditworthiness of each tranche. The rating agencies assign ratings to the tranches based on their perceived risk, with the senior tranches receiving the highest ratings and the junior tranches receiving the lowest.
8. **Marketing and sale**: The securities, now backed by the pool of loans, are marketed and sold to investors through [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] banks. Investors can invest in different tranches based on risk tolerance and [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] objectives.
9. **Distribute cash flows**: As borrowers of underlying loans make payments, the cash flows are collected by a servicer and distributed to the investors according to the terms of the securities. The senior tranches get priority over junior tranches in receiving payments.
10. **Monitoring and reporting**: Throughout the life of the securities, the servicer monitors the performance of the underlying loans and provides regular reports to the investors.

## Types of Securitization

There are several types of [[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|securitization]], each with its own structure and characteristics. The most common types include pass-through [[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|securitization]], pay-through [[Corporate Bonds and Loans|debt instruments]], and [[Credit Markets Session 5|collateralized debt obligations]] (CDOs).

### Tranches

The new securitized financial instrument may be divided into different sections called tranches. The tranches consist of individual assets grouped by loan type, maturity date, interest rate, and remaining principal. Each [tranche carries different degrees of risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pro-rata_tranche.asp) and offers different yields.  

### Pass-Through Securitization

[Pass-through](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flow-through.asp) [[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|securitization]] is the most basic form of [[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|securitization]]. In this structure, the cash flows from the underlying pool of assets are transferred to investors. The SPV issues securities, known as pass-through (or flow-through) certificates, which represent an undivided interest in the pool of assets (i.e., there are no tranches). As borrowers make payments on the underlying loans, the cash flows are collected by the servicer and distributed to the investors pro rata.

[MBS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp) issued by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are examples of pass-through [[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|securitization]].

### Pay-Through Debt Instruments

Pay-through instruments, also known as [[Other MBS|collateralized mortgage obligations]] ([CMOs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cmo.asp)) or [[[Other MBS|real estate mortgage investment conduits]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/real-estate-mortgage-[[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]-conduit-remic.asp), are a more complex form of [[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|securitization]]. For these, the cash flows from the underlying pool of assets are used to pay [[Notes on Currency Swaps|interest and principal]] on the securities issued by the SPV, but the securities themselves are structured as debt obligations.

The securities are divided into tranches with different maturities, risk profiles, and payment priorities. The cash flows from the underlying assets are allocated to the tranches based on a preset structure, with the senior tranches receiving payments before the junior tranches.

### Tip

[[[Asset Backed Commercial Paper Understanding the Risks|Asset-backed]] securities](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/12/[[Squam Lake Group Introduction|introduction]]-[[Asset Backed Commercial Paper Understanding the Risks|asset-backed]]-securities.asp) (ABS) are a general term for [[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|securitization]] backed by a pool of nonmortgage assets, such as auto loans, credit card receivables, student loans, or equipment leases. The cash flows from these assets are used to pay [[Notes on Currency Swaps|interest and principal]] on the securities issued by the SPV. Like other types of [[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|securitization]], ABS can be structured with different tranches, each with its own [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds|risk and return]] profile.

### Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)

[[Credit Markets Session 5|Collateralized debt obligations]] ([CDOs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp)) are a type of [[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|securitization]] that involves pooling together a diverse range of debt obligations, such as corporate bonds, loans, or even other securitized products like MBS or ABS. The pool of assets is then divided into tranches, each with its own [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds|risk and return]] characteristics.

Upping the ante, CDO-squared and CDO-cubed have underlying assets of CDOs and CDO-squared, respectively. These [played a significant role in the 2007 to 2008 [[8. Credit Modeling and Credit Derivatives|global financial crisis]]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032315/were-collateralized-debt-obligations-cdo-responsible-2008-financial-crisis.asp). Many of these securities were backed by subprime mortgages and experienced significant losses when the [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007–2011)|housing market]] collapsed. The complexity and [[Hedge Fund Replication and Strategy Indexes|lack of transparency]] in these structures made it difficult for investors to understand the true risks involved, leading to a loss of confidence in the securitized product market.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Securitization

Advantages
- Turns [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|illiquid assets]] into liquid ones
- Frees up capital for the originator
- Provides income for investors
- Small investors can participate

Disadvantages
- Investor assumes creditor role
- Risk of default on underlying loans
- [[Hedge Fund Replication and Strategy Indexes|Lack of transparency]] regarding assets
- Early repayment damages investor's [[Assets|returns]]

[[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|Securitization]] creates [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] by allowing retail investors to buy shares in instruments that would be unavailable to them. An MBS investor can buy portions of mortgages and receive regular [[Assets|returns]] from [[Notes on Currency Swaps|interest and principal]] payments.

Unlike other investments, many loan-based securities are backed by [collateral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp). In addition, as the originator moves [debt into the securitized [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042115/why-do-banks-securitize-some-debts-and-how-do-they-sell-them-investors.asp), it reduces the liability on its balance sheet, allowing it to underwrite further loans.

Although the securities may be backed by tangible assets, there is a risk of default. Moreover, early repayments will cut the [[Assets|returns]] the investor receives on the underlying notes. There may also be a [[Hedge Fund Replication and Strategy Indexes|lack of transparency]] about the underlying assets. Misrepresented MBS infamously played a toxic and precipitating role in the [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]] of 2007 to 2008.

## Example of Securitization

The [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] company Fidelity offers MBS that give investors a monthly distribution of principal and interest payments made by homeowners. For this example, Fidelity offers an MBS issued by various GSEs or agencies:

- Government National Mortgage Association ( [Ginnie Mae](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/ginniemae.asp) ): Ginnie Mae does not purchase, package, or sell mortgages but does guarantee their principal and interest payments.
- Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae): Fannie Mae purchases mortgages from lenders, then packages them into bonds and resells them to investors.
- Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( [Freddie Mac](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freddiemac.asp) ): Freddie Mac purchases mortgages from lenders, then packages them into bonds and resells them to investors.

When an investor purchases these securities, they are essentially buying a share in a pool of mortgages. As homeowners make their monthly mortgage payments (principal and interest), the cash is collected by the GSEs or agency and distributed to MBS investor pro rata.

Investors in MBS benefit from the regular cash flows from the underlying mortgages, as well as the potential for capital appreciation if [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] fall (as the value of fixed-income securities generally rises when [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] decline). However, they also face [[Risk Factors and Hedging Agency MBS|prepayment risk]], which is the risk that homeowners may refinance or pay off their mortgages earlier than expected, altering the [[Preview of the Book|cash flow]] profile of the MBS.  

By investing in these MBS, investors are exposed to the risks and [[Assets|returns]] associated with the underlying mortgages. These MBS are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, making them among the safest fixed-income investments. These are called [[[The Mortgage Market in the United States|agency MBS]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agency-mbs-purchase.asp), as opposed to non-agency (private) MBS, which make up but a small part of the market.

## Which Agencies Regulate Securitization?

Companies that engage in securities or [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] activities are regulated by the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

## How Are Investors Paid by Investing in Mortgage Based Securities?

Two types of MBS included [[Mortgage Pass-Through Securities|pass-throughs]] and [[Other MBS|collateralized mortgage obligations]] (CMO).

[[Mortgage Pass-Through Securities|Pass-throughs]] are structured as trusts in which mortgage payments are collected and passed to investors with stated maturities of 5, 15, or 30 years. CMOs consist of pools of securities known as tranches with varying credit ratings that determine the rates that are returned to investors.

## What Is the Difference Between an MBS and an ABS?

[[Fremont Financial Corp. (b)|Mortgage-backed securities]] are bonds backed by home loans issued to consumers. [[Asset Backed Commercial Paper Understanding the Risks|Asset-backed]] securities are bonds backed by auto loans, mobile home loans, credit card loans, and student loans.

## The Bottom Line

[[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|Securitization]] pools or groups debt into investable portfolios to make marketable [[A Practical Guide for Actuaries and other Business Professionals.|financial instruments]]. Investors can profit from the [[Notes on Currency Swaps|interest and principal]] paid on the underlying assets. Both [[Fremont Financial Corp. (b)|mortgage-backed securities]] and [[Asset Backed Commercial Paper Understanding the Risks|asset-backed]] securities are created through [[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|securitization]] and include mortgages, consumer, and commercial debt.
