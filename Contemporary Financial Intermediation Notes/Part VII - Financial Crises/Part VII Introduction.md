# The 2007–2009 Financial Crisis and Other Financial Crises  

“In its analysis of the crisis, my testimony before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission drew the distinction between triggers and vulnerabilities. The triggers of the crisis were the particular events or factors that touched off the events of 2007–2009 – the proximate causes, if you will. Developments in the market for subprime mortgages were a prominent example of a trigger of the crisis. In contrast, the vulnerabilities were the structural, and more fundamental, weaknesses in the financial system and in regulation and supervision that served to propagate and amplify the initial shocks.”  

Chairman Ben Bernanke (April 13, 2012).1

# INTRODUCTION  

The financial crisis of 2007–2009 is widely regarded as the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s.2 The crisis threatened the global financial system with total collapse, led to the bailouts of many large financial institutions by their national governments, caused big declines in stock prices, followed by smaller and more expensive loans for corporate borrowers as banks pulled back from lending, and decline in consumer lending, as well as lower investments in the real sector.3 The decline in lending to consumers and corporations also caused unemployment to rise.4 In the United States, Lehman Brothers, a global 158-year old investment bank, filed for bankruptcy, whereas Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two huge government-sponsored enterprises that have been key players in the securitization market in the United States, as well as the insurance giant AIG, were bailed out by the government, and Wachovia (the fourth largest bank in the United States) was bought out by Citigroup. In response to these events, financial markets became highly volatile, and the Dow Jones
