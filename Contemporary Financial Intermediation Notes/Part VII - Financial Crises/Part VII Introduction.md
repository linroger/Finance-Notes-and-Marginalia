# The 2007–2009 Financial Crisis and Other Financial Crises  

“In its analysis of the crisis, my testimony before the [[Squam Lake Group Letter|Financial Crisis]] Inquiry Commission drew the distinction between triggers and vulnerabilities. The triggers of the crisis were the particular events or factors that touched off the events of 2007–2009 – the proximate causes, if you will. Developments in the market for subprime mortgages were a prominent example of a trigger of the crisis. In contrast, the vulnerabilities were the structural, and more fundamental, weaknesses in the [[Contemporary Financial Intermediation Notes|financial system]] and in regulation and supervision that served to propagate and amplify the initial shocks.”  

Chairman Ben Bernanke (April 13, 2012).1

# INTRODUCTION  

The [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]] of 2007–2009 is widely regarded as the worst [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]] since the [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment 1928-1937|Great Depression]] of the 1930s.2 The crisis threatened the global [[Contemporary Financial Intermediation Notes|financial system]] with total collapse, led to the bailouts of many large [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial institutions]] by their national governments, caused big declines in stock prices, followed by smaller and more expensive loans for corporate borrowers as banks pulled back from lending, and decline in consumer lending, as well as lower investments in the real sector.3 The decline in lending to consumers and corporations also caused unemployment to rise.4 In the United States, Lehman Brothers, a global 158-year old [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] bank, filed for bankruptcy, whereas Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two huge government-sponsored enterprises that have been key players in the [[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|securitization]] market in the United States, as well as the insurance giant AIG, were bailed out by the government, and Wachovia (the fourth largest bank in the United States) was bought out by Citigroup.
