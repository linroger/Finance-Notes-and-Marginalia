# Contemporary Financial Intermediation

## Introduction

Financial markets and financial service firms channel money from savers to those with investment ideas, helping individuals and businesses raise capital. The more well-developed the financial system, the lower the transaction costs and obstacles to investment and economic growth.

The financial system contributes to economic growth through three key channels:
- Increases trade and the flow of goods and services
- Increases the rate of physical capital accumulation
- Increases the efficiency of combining capital and labor in production

## Key Services Provided by the Financial System

### Facilitates Trade
Financial systems help move money from one party to another, often across national boundaries. Without appropriate hubs and spokes for recording and clearing multilateral financial transactions, companies would be greatly impeded in their ability to do business with each other.

### Facilitates Risk Management
Financial systems help individuals and businesses improve their management of various risks. An increase in risk reduces investment. A financial system prices risk and provides mechanisms for pooling, ameliorating, and trading risk. By facilitating improved risk management for both borrowers and savers, the financial system spurs long-run investments that fuel economic growth.

### Mobilizes Resources
The financial system mobilizes resources that permit the development of better technologies leading to economic growth. As described by Walter Bagehot, in the past, lack of transferable money and funds to borrow from made it difficult to collect capital for immense works.

### Obtains and Processes Information and Allocates Capital
Individual savers may not have the resources or expertise to evaluate firms, projects, and managers before deciding to invest. Financial intermediaries have a cost and expertise advantage in collecting and processing such information, helping the capital-allocation process. This encourages investors to supply capital to intermediaries, which channel it to businesses that make investments fueling economic growth. Banks screen and monitor lenders before providing financing, giving depositors confidence to deposit money that can be used for loans.

## Debt Versus Equity Financing

Financial contracts for raising capital can be broadly divided into equity and debt.

### Equity Contracts
- Business sells an ownership stake to investors to raise capital
- Return to investment depends on profitability of the business
- No stated maturity; initial investment recouped only by selling ownership stake

### Debt Contracts
- Similar to a bank loan - lender is promised repayment of original loan amount plus interest
- Has a stated maturity and priority over equity
- Debt holders must be fully repaid before shareholders

## Individual/Consumer Financing

Consumers finance primarily with debt contracts (bank loans, home mortgages, credit card borrowing).

Credit card financing is unsecured debt, used for transaction financing, with high interest rates and fees:
- Viability rests on a well-developed financial system where banks can securitize credit card receivables
- Volume declines as financial systems become less developed

Banks and nonbank loans (from government entities, finance companies, credit unions, etc.) are a significant portion of financing available to individuals.

Home equity loans allow consumers to borrow against price appreciation in their homes.

## Business Financing

Businesses finance with both debt and equity.

### Equity Financing

#### Employee Ownership
Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) allow employees to become shareholders. Can increase employee pride, security, and productivity.

#### Retained Earnings
Vital source of internal equity financing. Portion of profit left over after expenses, debt claims, taxes, and dividends are paid. Viewed as a "sacrifice" by shareholders who forgo some dividends to build firm's equity. Companies generally retain 30-80% of after-tax profit annually.

#### Angel Financing
Provides critical early-stage funds to companies yet to establish track record to attract institutional financing. Can cost entrepreneur 10-50% ownership plus monthly management fees.

#### Financing from Customers, Suppliers, and Sales Representatives
Provided based on belief in growth potential and future profitability of the business.

#### Corporate Parents
Holding company may provide subsidiary with capital to avoid cost of raising external capital.

### Debt Financing

#### Commercial Banks
Traditionally important source of debt financing.

#### Institutional Lenders
Commercial finance companies and insurance companies are major sources of long-term (10+ years) debt financing.

#### Factoring of Accounts Receivables
Accounts receivables generated when a business makes credit sales can be factored.

#### Accounts Payable
Financing provided by a firm's suppliers.

#### U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)
Offers long-term loans for purchasing fixed assets, typically requiring personal guarantees from investors with >5% stake.

## Fractional Reserve Banking and the Goldsmith Anecdote

Fractional reserve banks fund themselves with liabilities convertible to cash on demand but hold only a fraction in cash assets. Always some probability that withdrawals exceed available cash.

### Evolution from Primitive Goldsmith to Bank
- Goldsmith provided secure gold storage for a fee, issuing warehouse receipts redeemable for the gold
- Over time, trade was conducted by exchanging receipts, with gold remaining in the vault
- Goldsmith realized not necessary to have a unit of gold for each outstanding receipt
- Issued extra receipts loaned to borrowers to earn interest

### Instability of the Fractional Reserve Bank
- Issuing extra receipts creates potential for insolvency if too many receipt holders demand gold
- Probability of insolvency is endogenous, chosen by the goldsmith based on how many extra receipts are issued
- Each extra receipt increases income but also the probability of insolvency

### Regulation as a Stabilizing Influence
Fractional reserve banking system subject to periodic collapse if left unregulated. Central bank acting as lender of last resort can lend against collateral of goldsmith's otherwise illiquid loans during extraordinary redemptions. Introduces moral hazard - goldsmith will make more loans knowing central bank backstop exists. Moral hazard typically addressed by imposing cash asset reserve requirements limiting lending volume based on cash assets. Regulation is endogenous, responsive to moral hazard from central bank backstop, which responds to inherent vulnerability of fractional reserve banking.

Banks solve two types of moral hazard problems:
- "Social" moral hazard problem of theft by helping cope more efficiently
- Moral hazard in lending by screening and monitoring borrowers

## Large Financial Intermediaries

Theoretical research suggests financial intermediaries (FIs) should be infinitely large ("natural monopoly") based on diversification benefits, assuming no internal incentive or coordination problems.

### Brokerage as a Natural Monopoly
- Information producer's customers concerned with information reliability
- Costly to ensure reliable information from a single producer
- Less costly with a team of producers who benefit each other and can monitor for free riding
- As team grows, more independent payoffs pooled and divided, reducing compensation risk via diversification
- Risk-averse producers demand less expected compensation, benefiting information buyers
- Benefit keeps growing with intermediary size
- When information is cross-sectionally reusable, larger intermediaries benefit more from reusing at a single acquisition cost
- Implication: investment banks, financial newsletters, credit rating agencies, etc. benefit from growing large
- Caveat: requires individual members to monitor and trust each other to avoid free rider problems as size grows

### Asset Transformation as a Natural Monopoly
Banks borrow from depositors and make loans.

Advantage in size comes from:
1. Conserving screening resources by performing credit analysis once vs. multiple depositors screening individually
2. Reducing risk to risk-averse depositors via diversification across many borrowers, lowering deposit interest rates

Diversification benefit keeps growing with size, making banks natural monopolies.

## How Banks Can Help Make Nonbank Financial Contracting More Efficient

Banks lower the cost of capital exchange between other parties, not just capital flowing through them.

### Inside Debt vs. Outside Debt
- Inside debt: creditor has access to non-public borrower information, may participate in borrower's decisions (e.g. board representation)
- Outside debt: publicly traded debt where creditor relies on public borrower information (e.g. Commercial Paper, Corporate Bonds)

### Bank Loan Advantages
- Short maturities require periodic renewal accompanied by bank evaluation of borrower's ability to meet obligations
- Loan renewal sends credible, positive signal to borrower's other creditors, reducing their need to expend resources duplicating bank's evaluation
- Ongoing depositor history gives bank information to assess and monitor loans at lower cost than competing lenders
- Helps reduce duplicated screening by multiple creditors

## Bank Risks

### The OCC's Risk Taxonomy

 | Risk Type | Description | 
 | ----------- | ------------- | 
 | Credit risk | Risk of borrower's failure to comply with loan contract terms | 
 | Interest rate risk | Exposure to losses arising from duration imbalances on assets and liabilities | 
 | Liquidity risk | Inability to realize full value on an asset owing to the need to monetize it on short notice | 
 | Price risk | Risk of assets varying in market value | 
 | Operational risk | Risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events | 
 | Compliance risk | Failure to adequately monitor and supervise, to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, both public and private, applicable to the organization | 
 | Strategic risk | Failure to achieve the goals of the enterprise's articulated strategy | 
 | Reputation risk | Risk of loss of brand equity or organizational credibility that jeopardizes the organization's ability to function successfully | 

### Core Risk/Competency by Institution Type

 | Institution | Core Risk/Competency | 
 | ------------- | --------------------- | 
 | Commercial bank | Credit or counterparty credit risk | 
 | Investment bank | Market or price risk | 
 | Life insurer | Mortality/morbidity/longevity risk | 
 | Property/casualty insurer | Assorted physical or moral hazards | 

## Ownership Structure of Depository Financial Institutions

Depository institutions have two ownership forms: stocks and mutuals. Agency theory predicts ownership form significantly affects firm incentives and operating efficiency.

### Mutual vs. Stock Ownership
- Mutual residual claimants are customers (policyholders, depositors)
- Stock S&L owned by stockholders; mutual S&L owned by depositors (and possibly borrowers)
- Stock S&L can raise capital by selling common stock; mutual S&L cannot

### Stock S&L Shareholder Rights
1. Claim to residual profits
2. Right to vote for board and change control
3. Right to dissolve the organization

### Mutual S&L Depositor Rights
- More like creditors; can't force payment above promised interest and principal
- Ownership claims to current earnings non-transferable; earnings can be retained indefinitely as net worth
- Limited voting rights, often signed over to management
- Little incentive to withdraw deposits and partially liquidate due to deposit insurance and interest rate ceilings

Important to distinguish de jure (legal) and de facto (control) ownership in a mutual:
- De jure ownership rests with customers but is largely vacuous
- De facto ownership rests with managers and government (via deposit insurance)

Agency problems exist in both stock and mutual S&Ls due to manager-owner goal misalignment, but the two types differ in owners' ability to monitor managers. Stockholders have greater control via consolidating control by purchasing stock.

## Choice of Ownership Structure by S&Ls

Earlier studies viewed mutual S&Ls as either:
- Cooperatives, with depositors and borrowers working for a common goal
- Benevolent associations organized to encourage saving and home ownership

Early community-based cooperatives had simple operations:
- Gathered deposits from the community
- Offered mortgages to community members
- Fair degree of homogeneity in mortgages made it easy to assess asset value based on historical data

Simplicity of S&L operations made mutuality an acceptable ownership structure. Eliminating classic conflict between creditors (prefer less risk) and stockholders (prefer more) made mutuality the preferred structure for many S&Ls. Simplicity of S&L operations meant managerial expertise was not critical for success. Early years, S&L industry dominated by mutuals run by less talented/efficient managers.

Two key differences between stock and mutual S&Ls:
1. Stock S&L owned by stockholders; mutual S&L owned by depositors (and possibly borrowers)
2. Stock S&L can raise capital by selling common stock; mutual S&L cannot

Advent of deposit insurance eliminated agency-cost-of-debt advantage of mutuals over stocks. With insured deposits, depositors indifferent to S&L's risk-taking. Agency cost of debt absorbed by Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC).

Deregulation and increased competition made it difficult for mutual S&L managers to compete with more efficient stockholder-owned counterparts. Inability to augment net worth through equity issues worsened competitive disadvantage for mutuals. Benefits of mutuality to owners diminished significantly.

Increased competitive pressures raised probability of bankruptcy and unemployment for inefficient mutual managers:
- Made any given level of perquisite consumption more costly for managers
- Benefits of mutuality to managers diminished as well

Positive incentive for managers to convert to stock ownership, as they usually benefit in initial stock sale:
- Managers typically receive rights to purchase underpriced new stock (as in IPOs)
- When benefits of conversion outweigh benefits of new optimal (lower) perquisite consumption, expect S&L to convert from mutual to stock

Could explain increased number of conversions in recent years as stockholder-ownership became preferred for both owners and managers.

## Observations on Mutuals (Cooperative Banks) in Europe

In several European countries (France, Netherlands, Germany), cooperative banks play an important role, often part of the largest segment of the financial services industry.

Often "layered" cooperatives consisting of multiple local (member) cooperatives that "own" the central cooperative (e.g. RABO Bank in Netherlands, Credit Agricole in France - latter even has a third layer).

Central cooperative may include professional services, common treasury operation, back-office facilities that facilitate economies of scale.

Model may provide:
- Strong roots in local markets via local cooperatives, facilitating relationship banking
- Scale and matching of funding across cooperatives

## The Borrower's Choice of Finance Source

When a firm is very young, it has two striking characteristics:
1. Entrepreneur may be unsure of own management expertise, so approaching a financial intermediary that can provide this expertise is beneficial
2. Borrower has few tangible assets to offer as collateral
   - Collateral useful in controlling moral hazard where borrowers stint on effort or take excessive risks
   - Without collateral, lender could use equity participation to address moral hazard
   - In borrower's interest to seek a lender who can take an equity position and offer capital at a "reasonable" price

Both factors suggest such firms should go to venture capitalists.

As firm grows and acquires tangible assets:
- Becomes capable of offering collateral to mitigate moral hazard
- Banks, prohibited in U.S. from taking equity positions, can now lend to such borrowers by securing debt with collateral

Collateral will not eliminate all moral hazard, so bank monitoring still important:
- Bank loans tend to be short maturity, generating periodic information through reassessments of borrower
- Information reflected in bank's decision to renew/terminate loan and new contract terms offered, combined with information from rating agencies
- Helps reduce duplication in information production by other creditors, diminishing overall contracting costs

Firms in this group find it better to go to banks than venture capitalists because:
- Banks can fund loans with insured deposits; venture capitalists cannot
- Borrower able to obtain loan at lower price

When firm is well-established and mature:
- Has good track record for repaying debts
- Reputation valuable, permits borrowing at preferential rates
- By taking undue asset risks, borrower stands to lose reputation, incentivizing limiting risk-taking
- Bank monitoring to combat moral hazard less important
- Permits directly accessing capital market where borrowing costs lower
  - Avoids paying bank its intermediation rents
- Still faces asymmetric information problems
  - Nondepository financial intermediaries like investment banks or credit-rating agencies play important role in transferring capital from investors to firms
  - Make information about firms available to investors at lower cost than investors could acquire themselves

Venture capitalist provides financing, monitoring, management expertise; bank provides financing and monitoring; capital market provides mainly financing.

## The Role of Capital in Bank Financing

Two facts about bank monitoring of borrowers:
1. Monitoring is costly, so banks need incentives to do it
2. Limits to effectiveness of bank monitoring, so there should be innate incentives for borrowers to make prudent decisions
   - Not all burden for ensuring prudent behavior should fall on bank monitoring

Benefit of bank monitoring is increasing likelihood of borrower repaying loan (reducing probability of default). Given monitoring cost, this benefit needs to be large enough to overcome the cost. Since borrower default creates loan loss absorbed by bank's equity capital, the higher this capital, the larger the benefit of monitoring to the bank.

Similarly, borrowers have stronger incentives to make value-maximizing decisions when they have more equity capital.

### Example
Borrower can choose one of three mutually exclusive projects:
- Good project (G) that maximizes firm value
- Bad project (B1) with negative NPV but some private benefits b for borrower
- Another bad project (B2) with negative NPV but even bigger private benefits B-b for borrower

Bank monitoring can eliminate borrower's ability to choose B2 but not B1. b-0 large enough that borrower would prefer B1 to G if project entirely financed with bank loan and borrower had no equity at stake. If borrower required to invest sufficient equity, would prefer G over B1. Bank will not lend unless borrower puts up enough equity.

### Theory Implications
1. If borrowers lack enough equity capital, they may be rationed
   - Having enough pledgeable collateral ameliorates this
   - Rationing arises from combined shortage of collateral and capital
2. Banks lend less when they have less capital
   - Insufficiently capitalized banks will not do costly monitoring
   - Lending limited to borrowers not needing monitoring
3. Enough bank capital enhances borrower's ability to obtain financing from other sources
   - Other financiers assured bank monitoring will result in borrower making right investment decisions
4. When borrowers have so much capital they would prefer G to B1 or B2 even without monitoring, bank lending diminishes in importance
   - Borrowers can directly access capital market or other unmonitored finance sources
   - Bank lending maximized at intermediate levels of firm (borrower) capital

## Blurring Distinctions Between Bank Loans and Capital Market Financing

Banks make Syndicated Loans with multiple participating banks, often traded similar to capital market trading. Banks make mortgage and credit card loans, package them into portfolios, issue securities against portfolios, sell securities in capital market where they are traded.

## Bank Risks

Risk is fundamental to banking, central to the "core competence" that enables a business to earn enhanced returns serving its clientele. Without this edge, service becomes commoditized by competitors bidding down prices until profit vanishes.

Core competence imparts advantage in managing a risk inherent in producing a particular service or economic good. These are core risks corresponding to core competencies.

In business context, risk is the distillate of randomness in the process generating earnings:
- May be mitigated through applying producer's core competencies - risk voluntarily accepted, even sought, as a business decision ("businessman's risk")
- May be unavoidable, as in force majeure or "act of god" - only protection may be insurance, if available, or leaving the industry

Core risks accompanied by ancillary risks - all other risks arising in the business for which the firm has no special processing skills:
- Require management nonetheless to avoid being destructive
- Shifted to others through capital/insurance markets, modifying operations, in extremis avoiding lines of business
- Not all ancillary risk avoidable while remaining in a particular business
- Residual ancillary risk remains, protected against with equity
- One firm's ancillary risk likely another's core risk, enabling trade in risks permitting mitigation, enhanced production and welfare

Risk central to financial intermediaries - clients see them as fundamentally providing risk-abatement services. Asked to provide credit, liquidity, interest rate certainty, various types of insurance alleviating risks for customers.

Special financial risks define categories of intermediaries:
- Credit risk the sine qua non of commercial banking
- Mortality risk defines life insurers
- Market (price) risk the core competency of investment banking
- Property risk the bailiwick of casualty insurers

Liquidity provided by any financial institution absorbing more illiquid claims than it emits:
- Bank deposits withdrawable on demand yet invested in illiquid loans
- Liquidity fleeting, often guaranteed explicitly or tacitly by central banks controlling money supply
- When facing excess withdrawals, banks can borrow from central banks

## Basic Banking Risks

A bank's shareholders bear risk when the firm's "assets" differ in some economically relevant way from its "liabilities":
- Liabilities are present value of commitments to make payments
- Assets are present value of expected receipts
- Amount and timing of both positive and negative payments uncertain
- Net of the two gives rise to risk
- Mismatches imply risks

Qualitative asset transformation involves mismatching the two sides of the balance sheet, creating particular forms of risk.

Three principal mismatches for banks:
1. Assets usually involve greater credit risk than liabilities
   - Bank's claim against borrower more likely to default than depositor's claim against bank
2. Assets usually of longer duration than liabilities
   - e.g. 1-year maturity loan vs. demand deposits withdrawable on demand (negligible maturity)
   - Creates interest rate risk
3. Liabilities usually more liquid than assets
   - Depositor able to withdraw funds at will
   - Bank cannot call a performing loan at will; loan unlikely to trade in active secondary market
   - Creates liquidity risk

## Credit, Interest Rate, and Liquidity Risks

### Default, Credit, or Counterparty Risk
Risk that a party to whom you lend fails to fully discharge loan contract terms. For a bank, risk that borrower fails to deliver contractual payments on timely basis.

Banks can avoid credit risk by purchasing assets with little/no default risk (government securities, triple-A rated debt):
- Provides very little return over bank's cost of borrowing; with other intermediation costs, profit may be negative
- Certainty achieved at cost of losses

Banks choose assets with nontrivial default risk, exploiting special ability (core competency) to mitigate default risk by resolving moral hazard and other informational problems.

Cash flow variations arise from physical and moral hazards:
- Banks screen borrowers to assess lending risk ex ante via analysis of financial statements and other relevant information (similar to bond rating agency)
- Bank monitoring designed to control moral hazard occurring after loan made
  - Borrower likely has incentive and opportunity to take actions increasing bank's risk exposure
  - Restrictive covenants included in loan contracts
  - Bank monitoring of borrower covenant compliance required

Efficiency of bank's basic functions key to determining its own credit risk.

Bank can further control default risk by holding many loans with imperfectly correlated prospects and diversifying:
- Bank's assessment, monitoring, contract design skills usually somewhat specialized
- Leads to diversification within limited set of industries

### Interest Rate Risk
When a firm's assets and liabilities are traded, they are subject to revaluation by the market. Any revaluation due to changes in level or structure of interest rates is interest rate risk.

Another aspect arises from loan prepayment uncertainty:
- Duration of loan can be shortened at borrower's discretion through premature repayment or loan contract term violation (loan automatically "accelerates")
- If market rates drop, borrower likely to exercise refinancing option - loan prepaid and new one issued
- Prepayment makes expected duration shorter than maturity and transforms duration (im)balance into random variable

### Liquidity Risk
Risk that an asset owner is unable to realize its full value at the time a sale is desired.

In banking:
- Borrower's liquidity risk is that lender may choose not to renew a loan borrower wishes to renew
- Bank's liquidity risk is that depositors may unexpectedly withdraw deposits and bank may be unable to replace them without impairing net worth

Applies symmetrically to borrowers in relationship to banks and banks in relationship to depositors (depositors are lenders to their bank).

More than just withdrawal risk - refers to potential loss seller incurs because selling price falls below fundamental asset value.

Most extreme manifestation is asset owner simply unable to sell at any positive price (market failure). In credit markets, known as credit rationing - borrower refused credit regardless of price.

More primitive, less active markets typically characterized by large bid-ask spreads (difference between price to buy and simultaneously sell an asset):
- e.g. Treasury bill buy at ask of $98.50, sell at bid of $98.25 - bid-ask spread is $0.25
- Range from small fractions of a percent for actively traded assets to 6-7% for residential property
- Time and effort required to capture full value of relatively illiquid asset

Bank holding illiquid assets can find itself unable to redeem liabilities on short notice:
- Problem of managing balance sheet against this is liquidity or cash management (cash is the most liquid asset)

Central bank provides other banks with crisis-avoiding liquidity by lending against illiquid but presumably sound earning assets:
- Designed to socialize a portion of bank's liquidity problem

## Enterprise Risk Management

## The Term Structure of Interest Rates

### Review of Fixed-Income Valuation
Current value of a $250 riskless cash flow received in 1 year solved using principle of riskless arbitrage. In efficient capital market, price of riskless cash flow in equilibrium must relate to prices of other riskless instruments.

Example:
- U.S. government bond promising $100 in 1 year currently trading at $94.56
- Implicit 1-year return on riskless instruments is 5.75% (since $94.56 [1 + 0.0575] = $100)
- Should be currently willing to pay $250/[1.0575] = $236.41 for riskless promise of $250 in 1 year

For a riskless cash flow promised 2 years from now:
- Find a riskless instrument of similar 2-year maturity and payment characteristics (only promised payment 2 years from now, no interim payments)
- Example: U.S. government "pure-discount" 2-year bonds promising $100 currently trading at $88.58
- Can deduce 2-year riskless yield io2 where $100 / [1 + io2]² = $88.58
  - Solving implies annual two-period yield io2 = 6.25%

Even though both year 1 and year 2 cash flows are riskless, they have different discount rates. Reason is future one-period interest rates are expected to increase.

Example:
- 1-year riskless rate at date 0 is 5.75%
- 2-year riskless rate at date 0 is 6.25%
- Can infer 1-year riskless interest rate i₁₁ expected to prevail at future date 1
  - 221.45 = 250 / [1.0575][1 + i₁₁]
  - Yields i₁₁ = 6.75%
- Two-period 6.25% rate is geometric average of successive one-period 5.75% and 6.75% rates

## The Role of Capital in Bank Financing

In reality, banks earn profits, especially on borrowers about whom they possess private credit information. To the extent banks charge higher rates to less capitalized borrowers, they may also earn greater profit margins on these borrowers. Can make prospect of lending to highly leveraged (low equity) borrowers enticing despite higher risk.

Banks can add highly leveraged loans to portfolios by lending for:
- Leveraged buyouts (LBOs)
- Acquisitions
- Recapitalizations

Yields on highly leveraged transactions (HLTs) are higher than other commercial loans:
- Higher yields compensate for higher risks, so not necessarily implying higher expected profits
- But borrowers often have few alternative credit sources, allowing banks to extract higher risk-adjusted profits
- Banks usually receive fees of 1-2% of principal committed

Reverse leveraged buyouts: firms reduce debt/equity ratios by issuing equity to retire LBO debt.

## Collateral

Most commercial and consumer lending is secured with collateral. Lender has first claim to collateral asset in event of default.

### Two Types of Collateral
1. **Inside collateral**: assets owned by firm receiving loan
   - e.g. accounts receivables, equipment, machinery, real estate, inventory
   - Even if loan unsecured, bank would have claim (but not necessarily first claim) against these assets
   - As general creditor, bank's claim value ill-defined since it might be one among many unsecured creditors at mercy of bankruptcy court
   - If one of these assets pledged as collateral, bank becomes primary claimant to that asset

[^2]: **Outside collateral**: assets bank would never have claim to unless specifically designated as collateral
   - e.g. personal assets of owner of borrowing corporation or limited partnership

Using collateral is not costless:
- Borrower may take actions undermining collateral value to bank, requiring ongoing monitoring
- When collateral transferred to bank upon default, there are liquidation costs (legal costs of ownership transfer, bank's costs of carrying and selling collateral)
- From borrower's standpoint, using collateral makes subsequent borrowing more expensive since fewer assets available to general creditors

### Three Reasons for Popularity of Secured Lending

[^1]: **Risk Reduction**
   - Provides lender greater protection against loss in event of default
   - U.S. bankruptcy code "automatic stay" freezes creditor collection actions during bankruptcy proceedings to give debtor breathing room
   - Stay takes effect upon filing bankruptcy petition
   - Can be modified for a creditor if there is "cause", including insufficient protection of secured creditor's collateral interest
   - e.g. If collateral assets depreciating, court might require firm to set aside that amount monthly to protect bank's claim
   - Securing a loan reduces creditor's bankruptcy risk

[^2]: **Signaling Instrument**
   - Collateral can convey valuable information to bank
   - Within a class of equally risky borrowers to the bank, a borrower's willingness to offer collateral inversely related to its loan default risk
   - Bank can induce borrower to reveal hidden risk by offering choice of secured loan with lower rate or unsecured loan with higher rate
   - Less risky borrower will prefer secured loan because:
     - Lower risk means higher likelihood of repaying interest, so lower rate more appealing
     - Lower risk means lower chance of defaulting and losing collateral, so offering collateral less onerous
   - Riskier borrower will prefer unsecured loan
   - Requires loan contracts offered to be incentive compatible

[^3]: **Moral Hazard**
   Using collateral can help resolve moral hazard problems:

   a. **Asset Substitution**
      - Due to option nature of bank loan, borrower has incentive to choose riskier project after obtaining loan
      - Collateral can deter such risk-taking similar to capital
      - Inside collateral deters asset substitution by ensuring specific assets will not be replaced by riskier ones
      - Reduction in asset substitution possibilities reflected in better debt price, advantage accrues to firm's shareholders

   b. **Underinvestment**
      - Borrower may be unwilling to invest additional funds in a project even if it increases total NPV
      - e.g. Real estate worth $1.5M, mostly bank financed
        - Spending extra $1M would enhance value by $1.1M
        - But if PV of repayment to bank is $2M, not worthwhile for owner despite positive NPV of $0.1M overall
        - Owner's NPV is -$0.4M ($1.5M + $1.1M - $2M = $0.6M increase in PV of cash flows, but $1M cost)
        - Investment passed up, firm value sacrificed
      - Arises from actions privately optimal for borrower's shareholders ex post, but they pay price ex ante as lender anticipates and adjusts credit terms
      - Precommitment not to underinvest is time inconsistent - lender knows borrower has reason to break promise
      - Loan covenants forcing investment difficult as lender typically doesn't "see" opportunities unless borrower exploits them
      - Secured debt can resolve underinvestment:
        - Firm needs financing to purchase asset below market value (positive NPV)
        - Has risky unsecured debt, would not purchase asset as enhancement to shareholder PV less than price
        - Issuing debt secured by new asset diverts cash flows to new secured creditors away from old unsecured creditors
        - New secured creditors pay fair market value, so gains from diversion accrue to shareholders, increasing investment incentive

   c. **Inadequate Effort Supply**
      - Borrower may expend insufficient effort managing firm when assets highly leveraged
      - Collateral can help resolve this moral hazard

Type and amount of collateral used depends on which problems are dominant.

Using collateral can be costly due to:
- Repossession costs
- Need to appraise collateral quality prior to loan and monitor regularly over loan life
  - Variations in collateral quality across borrowers may be large
  - e.g. Accounts receivable collateral higher quality if due from well-capitalized triple-A companies vs. weak credit risks
  - e.g. Contract receivables riskier with volatility in business cycles

Costs must be traded off against potential benefits in deciding how to use collateral in lending.

## Conditions

Economic conditions affecting borrower's repayment ability.

Borrower's income generation depends on:
- Selling prices of its goods
- Input costs
- Competition
- Quality of goods and services
- Advertising effectiveness
- Management quality

## Sources of Credit Information

Information used in underwriting credit is inherently costly and of uneven quality. Banker's critical skill in credit is assembling most germane information at lowest cost without violating legal or social norms. Standard credit sources classified as internal (within the bank) and external (all other).

### Internal Sources

[^1]: **Interview with Applicant**
   - Establishes uses of borrowed funds and conformity with bank's loan policies
   - Judges intangibles related to borrower's future repayment behavior
   - Provides loan officer opportunity to advise applicant about additional financial information needed

[^2]: **Bank's Own Records**
   - Bank maintains records of depositors and borrowers to assess past behavior
   - Shows payment performance on previous loans, checking/savings account balances, overdrawing patterns
   - Central file may contain information on applicants previously solicited as potential customers

### External Sources

[^1]: **Borrower's Financial Statements**
   - Required of most borrowers
   - Audited statements common in commercial lending
   - Even in consumer lending, applicant normally asked to list assets, income, expenses, outstanding debts

[^2]: **Credit Information Brokers**

       - Type of business
       - Nature of ownership
       - Composite credit rating
       - Payment promptness
       - Sales
       - Net worth

## Analysis of Financial Statements

In evaluating borrower's loan servicing ability, bank focuses on firm's internal sources for future funds generation:
[^1]: Net income
[^2]: Depreciation
[^3]: Reduction of accounts receivables
[^4]: Reduction of inventories

### Evaluation of the Balance Sheet

#### Assets

[^1]: **Accounts Receivables**
   - Among shortest maturity assets, typically seen as major source of cash flows to service short-term loans
   - Standard analyses focus on sizes, sources, aging of accounts, extent to which actively managed and diversified
   - Diversification lowers risk
   - Bank may investigate financial attributes of those owing money to borrower as they indicate receivables quality

[^2]: **Contract Receivables**
   - Borrower may be contractor engaged for future task
   - Official recognition may appear in chattel paper showing monetary obligations of party for whom task performed
   - These monetary obligations are contract receivables, often serving as collateral for working capital loan
   - Riskier than accounts receivables as payment conditional on borrower's future performance
   - Double moral hazard:
     a. Borrower may not successfully complete contracted task
     b. Third party may not pay borrower even if task successfully completed

[^3]: **Inventory**
   Issues in evaluating inventories:
   - Age
   - Liquidity
   - Price stability
   - Obsolescence
   - Shrinkage
   - Adequacy of insurance coverage
   - Stage of processing
   - Firm's inventory accounting method

[^4]: **Fixed Assets**
   - Banks normally do not consider fixed asset sale as a loan repayment source
   - Surplus fixed assets can be occasional strategic cash flow sources
   - Main importance is in producing cash flows, not resale value
   - Business restructurings often generate surplus fixed assets whose sale can be value creating

[^5]: **Intangible Assets**
   - Include trademarks, patents, copyrights, goodwill
   - Normally accorded little value by bank due to illiquidity and measurement errors

[^6]: **Amounts Due**
   - Banks often take dim view of firm's management if assets include amounts due from officers and employees
   - Creates suspicion of internal fraud and nepotism

#### Liabilities and Net Worth

[^1]: **Accounts Payable**
   - Borrower's accounts payable should speak volumes to its bank
   - If borrower does not pay trade creditors timely, bank should not expect to be treated differently
   - Bank should ascertain whether payables are in notes, may indicate firm denied trade credit
   - Bank should be alarmed if borrower asked for cash-on-delivery (COD) terms by suppliers
   - If borrower owes money to own shareholders or officers, bank should demand explanation, may ask such liabilities be subordinated to bank loan
   - Bank should review amounts accrued for taxes and other expenses

[^2]: **Long-Term Liabilities**
   - Consist of term loans, debentures, notes, mortgage loans, other liabilities with maturities over 1 year
   - Bank should be concerned with nature, maturity of these obligations and provisions made for required payments
   - Covenants may be important for bank considering loan request
   - Important to know if outstanding debt is secured and which assets already pledged as collateral

[^3]: **Net Worth**
   - Importance of equity capital to credit analysis is transparent
   - But accounting net worth is treacherous, fraught with measurement errors
   - Residual of independently evaluated assets and liabilities, each with errors, so compounds all underlying errors
   - If all assets and liabilities could be marked to market, net worth should be economic value of equity claims
   - With accounting distortions and measurement errors, can be hard-to-interpret residual

[^4]: **Contingent Liabilities**
   - Important due to potential to become actual liabilities
   - If realized, could seriously impair borrower's debt-servicing capability
   - Assessing relevant probabilities and exposures may require considerable information and sophistication
   - Do not always appear in body of borrower's balance sheet
   - Even when footnotes reveal exposure (maximum liability), PV of liability also depends on unspecified contingencies and probabilities

### The Income Statement

Income statement analysis complements balance sheet analysis. Bankers emphasize balance sheet for short-term loans, but devote greater attention to income statement for longer maturities.

Looking at past and present income statements, bank should learn about stability of borrower's cash flows:
- In determining cash flow trends, bank should note possible changes in borrower's accounting practices that can obfuscate

Bank often uses both balance sheet and income statement in ratio analysis.

### Key Financial Ratios

Key financial ratios convey information about firm's liquidity, stability, profitability, cash flow prospects.

Four basic types of ratios:

[^1]: **Liquidity**
   - Current ratio = current assets / current liabilities
     - "Current" means duration less than 1 year
   - Quick ratio (or acid test ratio) = (current assets - inventories) / current liabilities

[^2]: **Activity (or Turnover)**
   - Inventory turnover ratio = sales / inventory
   - Average collection period (in days) = receivables / sales per day
   - Total assets turnover = sales / total assets
   - Fixed Asset Turnover = sales / net fixed assets

[^3]: **Profitability**
   - Profit margin on sales = net profit after taxes / sales
   - Return on total assets = net profit after taxes / total assets
   - Return on net worth = net profit after taxes / net worth

[^4]: **Financial Leverage**
   - Leverage ratio = total debt / total assets

Two most important leverage ratios used by lenders:
[^1]: Pretax interest coverage = net income from continuing operations before taxes / reported gross interest expense
[^2]: Total debt to EBITDA
   - EBITDA = earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization

## Loan Covenants

Special clauses designed to protect bank and prohibit borrower from taking actions that could adversely affect repayment likelihood.

By agreeing to covenants limiting its actions, borrower precommits to eschewing strategies that might expropriate wealth from lender:
- Reduces moral hazard faced by lender
- Improves loan agreement terms for borrower
- Reduces agency costs of debt, benefiting borrower ex ante and lender
- Makes possible loans that would not otherwise be made

Limit to how restrictive covenants borrower will accept:
- Can make loan safe for lender but may deprive borrower of valuable investment options and strategies

Covenants normally depend on:
- Borrower's financial condition
- Borrower's investment opportunities
- Track record of borrower's management
- Bank's lending philosophy

Four kinds of covenants:
[^1]: Affirmative covenants
[^2]: Restrictive clauses
[^3]: Negative covenants
[^4]: Default provisions

### Affirmative Covenants

Obligations imposed on borrower.

Common examples:
- Requirement to periodically furnish bank with financial statements
  - Permits bank to track borrower's financial condition and take preventive steps if trouble indicated
- Requirement to maintain minimum level of working capital
- Requirement to maintain management acceptable to bank
  - If management changes due to resignation, death, etc., bank must approve replacement

### Restrictive Clauses

Designed to impose limits on borrower's actions.

Common examples:
- Limit on amount of dividends borrower can pay shareholders
  - Major creditor concern is borrower's inclination to divert liquidity and net worth to shareholders rather than keep in firm to protect creditors
- Restrictions on salaries, bonuses, advances to firm's employees
- Limits on specific types of investments like fixed asset purchases
  - Protects creditors against asset substitutions that may reduce firm's debt value
  - Purchasing fixed asset may replace cash on balance sheet with asset producing risky cash flows, increasing creditor risk exposure

### Negative Covenants

Prohibit certain actions outright, absent bank's consent.

Common examples:
- Negative pledge clause, usually in unsecured loans
  - Prohibits borrower from pledging assets as security to other lenders
  - Also encountered in secured loans
    - If borrower defaults, collateral value may be substantially diminished
    - For portion of bank's claim exceeding collateral value, bank has same status as general unsecured creditor under bankruptcy law
- Fewer assets pledged for other loans means greater share available to bank in event of bankruptcy
- Prohibitions regarding mergers, consolidations, sales of assets
  - These developments can alter firm's risk profile, possibly to creditor's detriment
