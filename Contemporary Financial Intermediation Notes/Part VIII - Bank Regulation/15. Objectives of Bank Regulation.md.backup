# INTRODUCTION  

In the previous chapter, we discussed one aspect of bank regulation, namely, [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md). In this chapter, we discuss bank regulation in a more general context, with attention to the objectives and incentive effects of regulation.  

Public regulation of [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) has a long and checkered history, with roots extending back to sovereigns who reserved to themselves the rights of coinage. By impressing their imprimatur on a flat piece of metal, a coin would be struck that would trade at a premium to the metal’s intrinsic value. The premium derived from the monetary services provided by the coin, which in turn was enabled by the coin’s managed scarcity and the authenticity of the coin’s ingredients signaled by the imprimatur. The premium or monopoly profit earned from the coin, called seigniorage, was appropriated by the sovereign, owner of the imprimatur. Seigniorage was one of the more efficient modes of taxation.  

Like coins, bank deposits provide monetary services, and they too are artificially scarce, even if their ingredients are altogether ephemeral. They also generate seigniorage, and this makes banks an obvious target of government regulation. But public regulation has encouraged circumventing adaptations on the part of the banks, which in turn has led to ever more intrusive forms of regulation. This dynamic, sometimes referred to as the regulatory dialectic, has led to more encompassing regulation.  

Numerous rationales for regulation have been advanced including:  

protecting safety and soundness of an individual institution, protecting the stability of the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md), fostering competition, consumer protection, credit allocation, and  monetary control.  

![](images/2165169420e1064d4746b11bc939a6f777b1c2a858238ee47df0ece42ebb6984.jpg)  

The manifestations of government regulation include disclosure requirements, antidiscrimination restrictions, community reinvestment standards, cash-asset reserve and [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) requirements, minimum capital requirements, branching and bank holding company (BHC) restrictions, asset proscriptions, loans-to-one-borrower limitations, and deposit interest-rate ceilings, among others. Figure 15.1 summarizes the major objectives of regulation.  

In the next section, we explain the most basic reason for bank regulation that arises from the governmental safety net (including [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md)). This is followed by a description of the agencies responsible for bank regulation, including those in the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the European Union (EU). Subsequently, the various “categories” of regulation will be discussed: safety and soundness, macroprudential regulation, governmental regulation of bank [market structure](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Market%20Structure%20and%20Size.md) and competition, consumer protection, credit allocation, and monetary control. The history of regulation and regulatory reform are covered in Chapter 16  

# THE ESSENCE OF BANK REGULATION  

The stability of a [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md) is of crucial importance for the smooth operations of the real economy. Several examples of financial crises, including the [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) of 2007–2009, demonstrate how costly bank failures are for the real economy (see Chapter 14). The safety and soundness of individual institutions is thus important, but thinking beyond individual institutions – focusing on the stability of the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md) at large – is paramount. Financial crises typically involve stress in several institutions all at once. This explains why we highlight both the safety and soundness of individual institutions and the stability of the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md). One view is more micro, focusing on an individual institution, and the other is more macro, looking at the system.  

Chapter 14 on financial crises discusses ways in which these two views are often related – an individual [bank failure](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Continental%20Illinois%20Case(1).md) may trigger problems in other banks and thus in the “system” through contagion. In any case, both safeguarding the safety and soundness of individual institutions and the stability of the system are foremost objectives of bank regulation.  

To illustrate the essence of bank regulation and safety concerns, consider the provisioning of a governmental “safety net” for banks in the form of a lender-of-last-resort (LLR) facility, [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md), or other guarantees. These create the possibility of exploitation of the government by the banks.1 This [moral hazard](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) necessitates a response if the safety net is to remain viable, and the response is normally some form of public regulation.  

# The Primitive Banker without a Governmental Safety Net  

Recall the goldsmith of Chapter 3 who evolved into a fractional reserve banker by printing warehouse receipts in excess of his or her gold holdings. The earnings on loans in that setting were seigniorage, a monopoly profit on the production of money in the form of receipts.2 Now consider this same monopolist goldsmith confronted by a nascent central bank. Suppose the goldsmith’s stock of gold has been purchased by the central bank in exchange for noninterest-bearing demand deposits at the central bank, and the central bank has in turn sold the gold in order to purchase interest-bearing government securities.3 Balance sheets might appear as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Central Bank</td><td colspan="2">Goldsmith</td></tr><tr><td>Government Securities</td><td>Deposits (Goldsmith's)</td><td>Deposits at Central Bank</td><td>Receipts</td></tr><tr><td>150</td><td>150</td><td>150</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td> Loans</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>850</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

First, notice that the 150 in deposits at the central bank are the voluntary cash asset reserves of the goldsmith. These are optimal in light of the goldsmith’s decision to circulate receipts of 850 in excess of liquid asset holdings. Second, notice that supporting the 1000 in goldsmith receipt liabilities is 1000 in collateral, 850 in the form of earning assets, and 150 in deposits at the central bank.  

Thus, the seigniorage on the receipts money is shared between the goldsmith in the form of lower earnings and the central bank in the form of government securities earnings. The sharing is determined, to a first approximation, by the goldsmith’s decision about how many excess receipts to circulate by making loans. This decision presumably reflects the goldsmith’s own risk-taking preferences. Notably, the central bank does not dictate a minimum fraction of deposits to be held at the central bank to back the goldsmith’s receipt liabilities. Hence, there is no legal cash-asset reserve requirement.  

# The Governmental Safety Net and Moral Hazard  

Now, in recognition of the goldsmith’s vulnerability to bank runs (see Chapter 2), let the central bank institute have an LLR facility. For concreteness, assume that the central bank stands ready to lend without limit to the goldsmith against performing (but illiquid) loan collateral at an interest rate of say 1 or $2\%$ above the [risk-free rate](../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md). Let us further assume that the volume of goldsmith receipts remains fixed. We can think of the volume of receipts as the [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) indicator, and the central bank can do open market operations (purchases and sales of government securities) to offset the bank’s possible inclination to expand receipts as a result of the [introduction](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Introduction.md) of the LLR facility.4  

Now the question is: How does the [introduction](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Introduction.md) of the LLR facility affect the bank’s choice of reserve ratio, or to put it differently, how does the [introduction](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Introduction.md) of the LLR affect the bank’s decision as to how many loans to make? Clearly, since the LLR represents an additional source of [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) for the goldsmith, there is a diminished need to hold nonearning central bank deposits.  

The goldsmith/bank will therefore increase its lending, which will temporarily increase the volume of receipts outstanding. The central bank will feel compelled to sell government securities in order to restore the amount of receipts to 1000.5 If we look at the new balance sheets, after the [introduction](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Introduction.md) of the LLR, we might find the following:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Central Bank</td><td colspan="2">Goldsmith</td></tr><tr><td>Government Securities</td><td>Deposits (Goldsmith's)</td><td>Deposits at Central Bank</td><td>Receipts</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>100</td><td>100</td><td>1000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td> Loans</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>900</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

Thus, the [introduction](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Introduction.md) of the LLR facility resulted in 50 of earning assets being shifted from the central bank to the goldsmith. This redistribution of earning assets is tantamount to a transfer of seigniorage from the government to the privately owned fractional-reserve goldsmith/bank, and is symptomatic of the [moral hazard](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) inherent in the LLR facility. The central bank provides the privately owned banks with a new layer of protection, the LLR facility, and because of its more secure position the goldsmith/bank sheds some of its own protection (cash assets) in order to expand earnings. But the expanded earnings of the goldsmith come, at least partly, at the expense of the central bank. From the central bank’s viewpoint, this is clearly an unintended and exploitative side-effect of the LLR facility. And if carried far enough, all of the goldsmith’s withdrawal or [liquidity risk](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) (see Chapter 6) will be transferred to the central bank. A private-sector risk of [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) will have been nationalized, and all seigniorage will be transferred to the goldsmiths/banks. From an immediate safety and soundness perspective (or stability perspective) the LLR facility helps in reducing the goldsmith’s vulnerability to bank runs but it comes at a cost: the goldsmith may exploit the LLR facility.  

# Regulatory Response to Moral Hazard  

This [moral hazard](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) threatens the viability of the LLR, and it therefore evokes an adaptive response by the central bank in the form of restrictions on bank behavior, such as legal cash-asset reserve requirements. These, together with sanctions for their violation, have clear analogs in private contracting. A fire insurance policy typically reduces the vigilance of the insured and thereby shifts additional risk to the insurer. The insurer reacts by requiring that the insured maintain minimum safety standards, and violations void the insurance coverage. In the case of deposit-taking banks, a large part of public regulation can be explained as protective responses to the moral hazards arising from safety-net provisions provided by the government. The most important among these are the LLR facility, [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md), protection of the payments system, and the toobig-to-fail policy.6 All of these create moral hazards that shift costs and risks from the private banks to the public (central bank) and, therefore, elicit restrictions on bank behavior designed to limit such exploitation.  

The key of this theory of bank regulation is that the potential for deregulation is intricately tied to the span of the safety net. Deregulation, beyond the elimination of redundancies, requires pari passu shrinkage of the safety net that prompted the regulation. This nexus is inescapable, and deregulation rhetoric that ignores the trade-off is just that. The problem is that the (perceived) immense costs of [bank failure](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Continental%20Illinois%20Case(1).md) and instability give rise to government bailout guarantees which for that very same reason cannot be shrunk. Recent regulatory initiatives try to counter this inevitability by attempting to contain the public cost of bank failures. The Dodd–Frank Act (see next chapter) and Volcker Rule (discussed later in this chapter) are attempts in that direction.  

# THE AGENCIES OF BANK REGULATION  

Paralleling the fragmented structure of the [financial services](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) industry is a similarly fragmented collection of public regulatory agencies. Responsibilities are organized primarily along national lines with substantial differences with respect to their regulatory frameworks. In a large majority of countries $(63\%)$ , central banks maintain supervisory powers over banks. In $27\%$ of countries, bank supervision is delegated to special supervisory agencies outside the central bank. In $4\%$ of countries, multiple bank supervisory agencies exist but other arrangements are also possible (World Bank, 2013).7  

Typically, the bank supervisory agency has multiple mandates (see Figure 15.2). It may include not just supervision and maintaining systemic stability, but also prevention of financial crime such as anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism, [bank restructuring](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Continental%20Illinois%20Case(1).md) and resolution, market conduct, consumer protection, and competition and antitrust policy. But a great diversity is observed: multiple intuitions may exist and also bank supervisory powers might be distributed over different agencies. A separate [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) agency may exist, but it can also be a part of the central bank (in $18\%$ countries with explicit [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md)) but it is rarely a part of a bank supervisory agency ( $2\%$ of countries) or even a part of the Ministry of Finance $1\%$ of countries).  

Via several multilateral organizations, attempts are made to create a more international overlay. Institutions like the [Financial Stability](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) Board (FSB), IMF, and the BIS seek to stimulate harmonization and go beyond local arrangements. In the EU, the common [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) (the Euro) – and particularly the crisis surrounding it – has led to pan-European supervision for key [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) (the [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Union).  

# The Regulatory Landscape in the United States  

In the United States each major fragment of the industry has its own dedicated regulatory agency, often duplicated at state and federal levels. For example, commercial banks, thrifts, and credit unions can be chartered (licensed) at either the state or the federal level. Therefore, each state will have a governmental agency charged with licensing, examining, supervising, and regulating thrifts, credit unions, and commercial banks. Likewise, the federal government licenses, regulates, supervises, and insures institutions. And [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) is managed by a federal agency, the Federal [Deposit Insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) Corporation (FDIC). The [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) has led to some attempts to strengthen the role of the federal government in supervising banks with a more explicit mandate for the Federal Reserve. Life and casualty insurance companies are regulated principally at the state level, but recent failures, with effects that spilled across state borders, have evoked calls for more coordination of insurance regulation at the federal level. Even in the securities business, where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dominates, corporations must seek approval of the states in which they are incorporated when issuing equity or [debt securities](../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md).8  

In this section, we discuss the agencies that regulate commercial banks. The complexity and fragmentation should be clear, even though we address only a smallish slice of the [financial services](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) industry.  

![](images/4f2f6bc96c3bf4f7c1e52a6a5e9f81c10d3606c530d15691433099527033c3d3.jpg)  
FIGURE 15.2 Mandates of the Bank Supervisory Agency. (Source: World Bank (2013), bars present a proportion of countries where a bank supervisory agency has a specified mandate).  

Dual [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) in the United States means that a bank can be licensed by either the federal government (the OCC), or by the state in which it is domiciled.9 Even state-chartered commercial banks are likely to be regulated by at least two federal bank regulatory agencies since they are required to satisfy the Federal Reserve’s cash-asset reserve requirements, and they are almost universally insured by the FDIC. National banks are subject to regulation by three or more federal agencies. A distinction is typically drawn between regulation, the setting of rules, and supervision, which is monitoring compliance. The latter subsumes examinations and related activities. All of the federal bank regulatory agencies – the OCC, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC, as well as the state [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) agencies – have both regulatory and supervisory responsibilities.10  

# Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)  

Lodged within the U.S. Treasury Department, the OCC historically played an important role as a federal bank regulatory agency. It was created pursuant to the National Bank Act of 1864 for the purpose of chartering and regulating “national banks.” At the time, virtually all banks in the United States were state chartered and state regulated. Indeed, the federal government had been out of the business of regulating banks since the early 1830s when President Andrew Jackson stifled the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States.11  

Recall that 1864 was the time of the Civil War, and a national [banking system](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Class%20Slide%203%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) was seen as an opportunity to provide a marker for Union bonds that were being sold in record amounts to finance the hostilities. So the National Bank Act imposed a $5\%$ tax on the liabilities of state-chartered banks and commenced the chartering of national banks, which were required to hold U.S. government securities to satisfy reserve requirements. Deposits were far less important than bank notes at the time both as a means of payment and as a financing instrument of banks. The OCC’s primary responsibility was the chartering and supervision of national banks which are a minority among commercial banks, but they tend to be the larger banks.  

Following the [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) of 2007–2009 (the [Great Recession](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md)), some changes have been made to the OCC. The Dodd–Frank Act has dissolved the Office of Thrift Supervision and shifted its responsibilities to the OCC as the charterer of savings and loans, and [the Fed](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) as the overseer of thrift holding companies. Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve got additional powers over systemically significant [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) (SIFIs), which might effectively reduce the importance of the OCC.  

# The Federal System  

The [Federal Reserve System](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Fed%20Fund%20Futures.md) was established in 1913 following a searching investigation prompted by a particularly disruptive financial panic in 1907. The principal purpose of the Federal Reserve was to provide LLR services to a [banking system](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Class%20Slide%203%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) vulnerable to [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) crises.12 As LLR, the Federal Reserve stands ready to lend for short periods to [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md)-strapped banks against eligible collateral. So from the very outset, the Federal Reserve used cash-asset reserve requirements to deter banks from substituting the [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) of the LLR facility for previously held cash assets.  

All national banks were required to be members of the [Federal Reserve System](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Fed%20Fund%20Futures.md), whereas membership was voluntary for state-chartered banks. Only in 1980 were all insured commercial banks compelled to meet the cash-asset reserve requirements of the Federal Reserve.  

The Federal Reserve has been a remarkably successful regulatory agency in at least two senses. It has managed to remain relatively free of scandal and it has, not coincidentally, enormously expanded the scope of its regulatory turf. Perhaps most important in the latter regard were the BHC Act of 1956 and the Douglas Amendments thereto of 1970. These laws gave the Federal Reserve regulatory control over all BHCs. Practically every important bank in the United States is owned by a BHC, and the Federal Reserve has immense discretionary power over virtually every initiative taken by banks via their holding companies.13 These typically include acquisitions and mergers both within and outside of [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md).  

Explicit permission is required from the Federal Reserve for each and every subsidiary formed or purchased by a BHC, and the criteria for approval leave broad scope for discretion by the Federal Reserve. No wonder the chairman of the Federal Reserve is sometimes described as the second most powerful person in the United States.  

The [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) of 2007–2009 led to a further expansion in the role of the Federal Reserve, as it became involved in providing [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) and capital to a vast array of nondepository, uninsured institutions in the shadow-[banking system](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Class%20Slide%203%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) like mutual funds, [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) banks, and insurance companies (see Chapter 12 for a discussion of shadow [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md)). The Federal Reserve’s vast regulatory discretion together with its power to influence capital markets places it first among the many public regulators of [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md). The major weaknesses in the U.S. supervisory structure of the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md) that were revealed by the 2007–2009 [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) – specifically the inefficiency of supervising interconnected depository institutions and shadow banks in different regulatory silos – have led to a further clarification (and strengthening) of the mandate of the Federal Reserve. In particular, the Federal Reserve got additional oversight responsibilities for SIFIs, regardless of whether these SIFIs are commercial banks or not.  

# The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)  

The [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) involved banks making loans (mostly home mortgage loans) to borrowers who were ill-equipped to repay them. This was part of a general trend of increasingly lax lending standards that were discussed in the [Introduction](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Introduction.md) to this book. This practice came to be called “predatory lending”, which is meant to imply that uninformed (and financially unsophisticated) borrowers were lured into taking unaffordable mortgages through the aggressive and misleading sales tactics of banks.14 As a response, the CFPB was established as an independent agency by the Dodd–Frank Act with a task of consumer protection in the field of mortgages, credit cards, and financial products and services at large. The CFPB is located inside the Federal Reserve but is independent of it.  

# The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)  

The FDIC was established during the [Great Depression](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%201928-1937.md) in 1933. As with its predecessors, there was profound political ambivalence about government [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md). Despite a collapsing [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) industry and a similarly compelling need to restore public trust, President Roosevelt spoke out strongly against federal [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) for the very reasons we now use to explain recent S&L and bank losses. The patrician Roosevelt was a half century ahead of his time. Nevertheless, he ultimately signed the [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Act of 1933 that provided federal insurance of bank deposits for the first time in U.S. history, and with it came the FDIC.15 The original plan called for protections of the first $\$2500$ in each bank account, but over the years coverage has expanded to $\$250,000$ .16  

In addition to the explicit insurance, the FDIC has often remunerated depositors with balances in excess of the stated limit so that very few “uninsured” depositors since 1933 have lost money owing to bank or S&L failures. This second layer of implicit insurance coverage is provided at the discretion of the FDIC and is typically rationalized in one of two ways. It is either less costly to compensate all rather than some, or imposing losses on some is too destabilizing to the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md) and the failed bank. This is of value since liquidation adds costs to compensate uninsured depositors and preserve the bank as an ongoing entity, possibly as a part of another bank.  

These arguments can be self-serving, and specious too. Nevertheless, for many years the modus operandi worked acceptably. [Deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) premiums were low (6–12 basis points) per annum, levied against insured as well as uninsured domestic deposits. Bank failures were few (averaging less than 10 per year before 1975, and almost all of these were small banks), and the [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) funds (the FDIC’s and the FSLIC’s) grew steadily, until the 1980s. The FDIC was a regulatory backwater during most of this time, rarely seen or heard from. Its anonymity was testimony to its success.  

This changed when bank failures ran at 200 per year in the late 1980s, with very large banks represented among the failed. These traumas led to insurance premia rising to about 25 basis points in 1993. The FDIC Combined [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) funds was in deficit in 1991, but recovered in 1992, and since then grew steadily until the [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md). The FDIC’s measure of “well being” is its fund balance as a percentage of the total deposits insured. It is called the reserve ratio, defined as:  

![](images/e318f1b44960a851b6abf6c1437345983cb4ad9faaffff3826d10c098538e197.jpg)  
FIGURE 15.3 FDIC Combined [Deposit Insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) Fund (Fund Balance in Billions of Dollars: Left Axis; Reserve Ratio in $\%$ on the Right Axis). (Source: FDIC).  

Figure 15.3 shows the behavior of the reserve ratio through time. Regulation requires that the designated (minimum) reserve ratio is $1.25\%$ . The [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) assessment rate during 2006 ranged between $0\%$ and $0.27\%$ , with most banks paying no [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) premiums and the average annual assessment at roughly $0.11\%$ . The reserve ratio became negative during the global (or subprime) [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) in 2009 and 2010.  

The Dodd–Frank Act has established a separate fund, the so-called Orderly Liquidation Fund  funds from which can be used in the case of liquidation of a large, complex financial company whose failure poses a systemic threat to [financial stability](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) in the United States.  

# The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC)  

The Dodd–Frank Act created the FSOC with the objective to have a more integral (macro) picture of the stability of the U.S. [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md). It seeks to identify risks to the [financial stability](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) of the United States, promote market discipline, and respond timely to the threats to the stability of the U.S. [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md). Council members include senior representatives of the major regulatory agencies. The FSOC is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and has a broad authority to monitor, analyze, and estimate risks in the U.S. [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md). It suggests to Congress and the Federal Reserve changes in the regulation of [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) or markets in order to mitigate systemic risk in the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md). Its mandate is broad. For example, the FSOC (with a two-thirds super majority among its voting members) can place a nonbanking financial institution under the supervision of the Federal Reserve if it poses a serious threat to the stability of the U.S. [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md).  

# The Office of Financial Research (OFR)  

The OFR was established by the Dodd–Frank Act within the Treasury Department to provide support to the Council and other bank regulatory agencies. The salaries within the OFR are exempted from the General Schedule pay rates that apply to the majority of the Federal employees in order to attract the most qualified personnel. Its director is appointed for a 6-year term and can issue subpoenas; that is, the director can issue orders to collect all data necessary to achieve the OFR’s objectives.  

# Other Federal Agencies that Regulate Banks  

Nonbank government agencies involved in [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) include the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (every cash transaction of $\$10,000$ or more, with certain exceptions, must be reported to the FBI). Banks also face financial market regulators (like the FTCC) and the Department of Justice that can impose substantial fines for misbehavior. However, these agencies are less involved in the day-to-day operations of banks than the [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) agencies.17  

Noteworthy are also the SEC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. The former regulates the sale of [debt and equity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/I-%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20Markets%20and%20Intermediation/I-%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20Markets%20and%20Intermediation/Class%20Note%201-%20Borrower-Lender%20conflicts%20and%20implied%20agency%20problems.md) securities in public markets. The latter has the responsibility for administering antitrust laws in cases of bank mergers and acquisitions, and in cases of collusion and other anticompetitive behaviors.  

The SEC has asserted itself also in the debate over bank accounting, e.g. the choice of GAAP accounting versus market value accounting. This is an SEC issue because it relates to financial reporting and disclosure to the financial market. We shall return to this issue later.  

# The Regulatory Landscape in Japan  

Bank regulation in Japan falls under the scope of the [Financial Services](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) Agency. The [Financial Services](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) Agency is an external body of the Cabinet Office of Japan. Its goal is to safeguard the stability of Japan’s [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md) and protect depositors. In addition, it is also responsible for protection of insurance policyholders and securities investors, and the establishment of fair and transparent [financial markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md). Its tasks include [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md) planning, policymaking, and supervision of [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) (i.e., banks, insurance companies, and [financial markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) participants). Its affairs also cover the review of accounting standards and the supervision of certified auditing firms and public accountants (see http:// www.fsa.go.jp/en/index.html).  

[Deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) in Japan is the responsibility of the [Deposit Insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) Corporation of Japan (DICJ). The DICJ’s main operations include [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) operation (e.g., collection of insurance premium from insured [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md)), failure resolution, capital injection, purchase of [nonperforming loans](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/The%20Workout%20Crew.md), and pursuit of civil and criminal liability of managers of failed banks. Deposits for settlement and payment purposes are entirely covered by [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md). Time deposits are covered up to the maximum amount of $\yen10$ million in principal plus accrued interests (www.dic.go.jp/english/index.html).  

Although equipped primarily with the responsibility of [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md), the central bank of Japan – the Bank of Japan – also provides settlement services and is responsible for the stability of the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md). It also acts as a LLR.18  

# The Regulatory Landscape in the United Kingdom  

Before 2013, bank regulation in the United Kingdom was based on the tripartite system that involved three regulatory agencies: the [Financial Services](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) Authority (FSA), the [Bank of England](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock.md) (the central bank of the UK), and the Treasury. The FSA was the main [UK bank](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock.md) regulatory agency and was responsible for maintaining confidence and stability in the UK [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md). Its role also included consumer protection and the reduction of financial crime.  

The inability to foresee the beginning of the [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) in 2007 led to major regulatory changes in the United Kingdom. Following the enactment of the [Financial Services](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) Act (2012), the FSA was abolished and two new regulatory authorities, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), were created.  

The FCA is responsible for [financial markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) and proper conduct of [financial markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) participants with an aim to protect consumers from abusive practices of [financial firms](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Introduction.md). The FCA is an independent regulatory agency and is funded by charging fees to the members of the [financial services](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) industry that it regulates.  

Substantial regulatory and supervisory powers were placed under the umbrella of the [Bank of England](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock.md). The PRA is, as a part of the [Bank of England](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock.md), responsible for the stability of the UK [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md). It regulates and supervises deposit taking institutions, insurance companies, and large [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) firms. It is also responsible for appropriate protection of insurance policyholders.  

In addition to the PRA, an independent Financial Policy Committee (FPC) was created as a subsidiary of the [Bank of England](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock.md). The primary objective of the FPC is to identify, monitor, and reduce systemic risk and safeguard the stability of the UK [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md). It is responsible for the supervision of providers of financial [market infrastructure](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%203%20Financial%20Market%20Utilities.md) and also helps the Government in its economic policy.  

Earlier, the [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Act of 2009 had already given the [Bank of England](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock.md) substantial powers in dealing with bank failures. In particular, the Resolution Directorate within the [Bank of England](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock.md) plays a key role within the Special Resolution Regime with tools to successfully restructure failing banks.  

[Deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) in the United Kingdom was formally introduced by the 2000 [Financial Services](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) and Markets Act. It allocated responsibility to the [Financial Services](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) Compensation Scheme, an independent agency accountable to the regulators and to the Treasury with its directors appointed by the FCA and PRA. It covers £85,000 of deposits per person per bank but also £50,000 of investments and £50,000 of home finance instruments per person per bank. It also protects $90\%$ of insurance claims with no upper limit.19  

# The Regulatory Landscape in the EU  

Bank regulation and supervision in the EU was historically under the authority of domestic regulators. The [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) showed that national regulation and supervision of banks was inadequate in the highly interconnected European [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) market, especially in the euro area where the single [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) (the Euro) led to a fast integration of the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md). The regulatory overhaul in the EU has led to the establishment of a common regulatory and supervisory framework, the so-called [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Union  The [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Union is built on a single rulebook for [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) in the EU and comprises the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM).  

The single rulebook contains the legal framework of regulatory rules that all EU [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) must comply with. It legislates capital regulation, synchronizes rules for [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md), and sets up the rules for bank regulation and prevention of bank failures.  

The SSM gives the ECB the authority to supervise the largest banks in the Euro area. The national supervisors maintain supervision over the remaining – smaller – national banks, but they are subject to control from the ECB. The ECB monitors whether banks comply with the single rulebook (in particular, whether they are adequately capitalized) and is responsible to trigger early intervention into failing banks. The SSM became operational in 2014.  

The SRM establishes a new, independent EU Agency called the Single Resolution Board to deal with failing banks within the EU. It also establishes the Single Bank Resolution Fund built up by contributions from banks in the EU. The Single Resolution Board will use resolution tools granted by the SRM and the funds from the Single Bank Resolution Fund to effectively deal with failures of national banks and of cross-border banks. The SRM became operational starting January 1, 2016.  

The proposed [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Union is a product of the massive crisis surrounding the Euro. Several governments were not able to contain deficits and be sufficiently competitive to comply with rules set for the single [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). Domestic banks with substantial exposure on the sovereign bonds of their countries were part of the general confidence crisis. The [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Union seeks to strengthen banks in Europe and in doing so also strengthen the foundation for the single [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). How this will evolve will be a big unknown as the Euro area consists of 19 countries with strong domestic mandates that may conflict with the coordination that a [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) union demands.  

The [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Union follows an earlier attempt to integrate the European financial sector. In 2008, the EU established the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) consisting of three new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) – for [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md), insurance and [financial markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) – and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).20 The ESRB is responsible for macroprudential surveillance of the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md) in the EU, somewhat like the [Financial Stability Oversight](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/The%20Dodd%20Frank%20Act%20and%20Its%20Impact.md) Council in the United States. Its tasks include prevention of systemic risk, safeguarding [financial stability](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md), and the smooth operation of the financial sector in support of the real economy.  

The three European supervisory authorities – the European [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) – are three independent regulatory agencies, each responsible for supervision in a particular industry. But contrary to the ECB-linked [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Union, each ESA primarily has “soft” powers, meaning that its role is mainly to provide coordination. The EBA is responsible for determining the uniform regulatory and supervisory technical standards, guidelines and best practices and their applications across the EU.21 The EBA can provide opinions to the European Parliament, the Council, and the European Commission. The EBA also acts as a mediator to resolve potential conflicts between national supervisors and acts as a coordinator in emergency situations.22 How the ESAs and ESRB fit within the [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Union is still open to debate. Several issues may come up, including the different geographic reach (the ESAs and ESRB are linked to the 28 EU member states; the [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Union primarily addresses the 19 Euro members), and also turf battles between the EU and the ECB are possible (the [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Union is linked to the ECB while ESAs and ESRB “belong” to the EU). In any case, the “European project” is work in progress.  

# International coordination  

Following the 2007–2009 [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md), international coordination has gained additional momentum. Agencies such as the Basel Committee, the FSB and the G-20 – comprising government leaders of the largest 20 economies in the world – have urged the adoption of initiatives to promote global [financial stability](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md). In the following sections, we will discuss the Basel Committee that plays a key role in setting capital requirements around the globe. The FSB consists of senior policymakers from Ministries of Finance, Central Banks, and supervisory and regulatory bodies and promotes [international financial](../../International%20Finance/Lecture%20Notes%20on%20International%20Finance.md) stability “by coordinating national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies as they work toward developing strong regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies. It fosters a [level playing field](../../Financial%20Engineering/An%20Introduction%20to%20Equity%20Markets.md) by encouraging coherent implementation of these policies across sectors and jurisdictions.”23 The FSB is closely linked to the G-20.  

Apart from these bodies, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) plays an important role in safeguarding financial and economic stability across the world.  

# SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS REGULATION  

Bank regulation seeks to promote the “safe and sound” operation of banks, and in tandem preserve the stability of the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md). The latter has a macro-prudential focus that is the subject of the next section. We focus first on the safety and soundness of individual [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md). In Chapter 12, we explained how [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) creates a risk-inducing [moral hazard](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md). Thus, restrictive regulations are deployed to mitigate these endogenous risks that arise due to the government safety net. Government safety net includes the explicit [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) scheme (see the discussion of the FDIC in the United States and [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) arrangements in the previous section) but also consists of implicit government guarantees to [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) that are deemed too big (or important) to fail. Figure 15.4 summarizes the types of safety regulation. Redundancy in these regulations recognizes the difficulty of achieving safety objectives, especially when the regulated institutions can circumvent these regulations.  

# Regulatory Monitoring  

The periodic examination of banks by public regulatory agencies is a central part of regulation in the United States. Indeed, each of the three federal bank regulatory agencies employs bank examiners and each of the state [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) agencies has theirs as well.  

Although bank examiners have overlapping jurisdictions, there is a formal division of labor. The OCC examines all national banks, the Federal Reserve all state-chartered Federal Reserve member banks (and BHCs), and all remaining FDIC insured banks.24 Of course, the states are responsible for examining all state-chartered banks, too. Often state and federal agencies accept each other’s exams. Sometimes they examine jointly. There is some coordination, along with considerable redundancy. Examination details in the U.S. Regulatory Rating System are discussed below.  

A uniform interagency bank rating system known as CAMEL (capital adequacy (C), asset quality (A), management ability (M), earning quality (E), [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) level (L)) was adopted in 1978. In 1997, a sixth factor, “Sensitivity to Market  

![](images/bac66d81c1ee5e47d8673971b8a248578fe2b17dad63c44767637972eabfdf39.jpg)  
FIGURE 15.4 Types of Safety and Soundness Regulation. (Source: FDIC [Historical Statistics](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Moody's%20Corporate%20Default%20and%20Recovery%20Rates,%20%201920-2008.md) on [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md)).  

Risk” (S), was added, to make it CAMELS. None of these factors is judged in isolation. For example, what is considered acceptable asset quality will depend on how much capital the bank has.  

Capital Adequacy: The bank’s capital is evaluated on the basis of both the bank’s sizes as well as the composition of its assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet. We will have more to say about capital shortly.   
Asset Quality: Examiners assess the credit risks in the various loans in the bank’s [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and classify these loans as: good, substandard, doubtful, or loss.   
Management Ability: Examiners attempt to gauge not only the bank’s management but also its board of directors. Competence, management acumen, integrity, and willingness to comply with [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) regulations are some of the factors assessed.25   
Earnings: There is an evaluation of the earnings as well as their level relative to peers. One objective is to assess the impact of internally generated funds on the bank’s capital.   
[Liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md): Regulators assess [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) by examining credit conditions, deposit volatility, loan commitments, and other contingent claims against the bank, capital, current stock of liquid assets, and the bank’s perceived ability to raise funds on short notice.   
Sensitivity to [Market Risk](../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%205%20-%20Index%20Futures.md): Regulators assess how sensitive the bank’s asset, liability, and net worth values are to changes in market condition like [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).  

Until recently, regulatory examinations served in lieu of external audits for most banks. However, bank examinations are not the equivalent of an external audit. External audits focus on financial reporting and consistency with GAAP and are put to external as well as internal use. Bank examinations focus on asset quality and the effectiveness of monitoring and are for internal use exclusively. Indeed, it is illegal to disclose bank examinations (e.g., CAMELS ratings) outside the bank. Both regulatory exams and external audits also seek to uncover fraud, but some would say with mixed success.26  

The Federal [Deposit Insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) of 1991 mandates annual, full-scope examinations of banks by regulators. These regulatory examinations and audits are predicated on the assumed informativeness of ratings-based classifications resulting from the examinations in terms of their ability to reveal the bank’s true financial health.  

The result of the bank’s regulatory examination are reported to the bank’s board of directors, with subsequent dialog between the examiners and directors to clarify issues and to discuss steps for dealing with the problems uncovered by the examination. The examination report is then submitted to the supervisory authorities whose relationship with the bank is guided by the findings of the report.  

Supervisors can impose wide-ranging sanctions for improper actions by the management or the board. Advice is followed by warnings, then cease and desist orders, in which a supervisor requests that the management halts an activity or does not repeat it in the future, or else faces legal action. Management can be discharged. Directors can be fined, discharged, and barred from [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md). The bank can be put into conservatorship or into receivership. Directors and officers can be sued civilly and/or criminally for failure to discharge fiduciary responsibilities, for negligence, gross negligence, or criminal negligence. The regulators’ power to impose sanctions is expansive.  

How informative CAMELS ratings are in assessing a bank’s financial condition is an open question. It seems plausible that during stable periods in the [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) industry, these ratings are more informative about banks’ financial conditions than during times of crises when some of the factors in CAMELS may be less relevant.27  

The Federal Reserve uses a wider rating system for the BHCs, named RFI/C(D), an acronyms derived from the main components of the rating systems: [risk management](../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) (R), financial condition (F), potential impact (I) of the parent company and non-depository subsidiaries, and the depository institutions (D) component (see Section 4070 of the BHC Supervision Manual, Federal Reserve Board, 2014a). [Risk management](../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) (R) measures the effectiveness of BHC’s [risk management](../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) and controls and is constructed based on four subcomponents: board and senior management oversight, risk monitoring and management information systems, internal controls, and policies, procedures, and limits. Financial condition (F) measures the stability of a BHC through the assessment of earnings, capital, [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md), and asset quality. Impact (I) assesses the downside risk of nondepository entities within a BHC on the subsidiary depository institution. The depository institution (D) component is computed based on the CAMEL rating of the subsidiary depository institution. All the ratings are then combined in the composite rating (C).  

The largest and systemically important BHCs are also subject to the additional comprehensive capital analysis and review (CCAR) in which the Federal Reserve assesses (based in part on stress tests) whether they have sufficient capital and sufficiently robust risk-management practices to sustain prolonged periods of [financial distress](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Southland%20Corp.%20(c).md) (see Federal Reserve Board, 2014b).  

Supervisory processes differ substantially across countries. To improve supervision across the international [banking system](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Class%20Slide%203%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md), The Basel Committee on [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Supervision (BCBS, 2012) provides key principles for effective [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) supervision. Key principles address supervisory powers, responsibilities, and functions and include supervisory [expectations](../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) of bank behavior focusing on good corporate governance, [risk management](../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md), capital adequacy, and compliance with supervisory standards. For example, an important supervisory principle is to monitor concentration risk and large exposure limits. That is, a bank may become exposed excessively to a single large borrower or to a group of connected borrowers. The supervisor needs to carefully monitor whether banks adequately identify, measure, and control concentration risks.  

The effectiveness of safety and soundness regulation cannot be taken for granted. Institutions can take actions to undermine it. Such actions are referred to as regulatory [arbitrage](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md). An example of regulatory [arbitrage](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) is how the once imposed deposit interest-rate ceilings were bypassed by disintermediation (see the box below).  

# Deposit Interest-Rate Ceilings  

Deposit interest-rate ceilings, enforced via Regulation $\mathrm{\DeltaQ,}$ came into existence with the [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Act of 1933. Payment of interest on demand deposits was prohibited and the Federal Reserve was authorized to impose ceilings on the [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) paid on time and savings deposits by member banks. Regulation Q $^{\prime\prime}{\sf R e g}{\sf Q}^{\prime\prime}$ for short) was subsequently extended to all FDIC-insured banks.  

The ${\sf R e g Q}$ ceilings lowered deposit costs and thereby offset unpopular [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) premiums. Deposit interest-rate ceilings were defended on two grounds. First, it was thought that the incentives of banks to invest in risky assets would be weakened, and bank’s profits would be both higher and less volatile. Second, it was believed that if [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) were not restricted, larger banks in the money centers would attract deposits away from rural areas.  

Whether deposit interest-rate ceilings can achieve either of these objectives depends on the effectiveness of nonprice competition. When a bank wishes to attract more deposits and finds the Reg Q ceilings binding, it will compete on other dimensions. During periods in which Reg Q ceilings were binding (such as 1969–1970, 1973–1974, and 1978–1980), banks engaged in nonprice competition, ranging from merchandise giveaways to subsidized cash-management services.28  

Of course, the fact that banks and other depository institutions could circumvent deposit interest-rate ceilings does not mean   
that the ceilings were without effect. The nonprice competition induced by the ceilings distorted the allocation of resources. To   
see this, note that banks could have offered nonprice inducements to depositors even in the absence of ceilings, and it is pos  
sible that the unconstrained optimal allocation involves both the payment of explicit interest and the provision of other services to   
depositors. But when the Reg Q ceiling is binding, more resources will be allocated to the provision of these ancillary services, and   
this additional allocation represents an almost certainly inefficient distortion. Moreover, like reserve requirements, Reg Q ceilings   
induced innovation of new liability instruments. Eurodollar deposit growth was stimulated by both reserve requirements and Reg Q. By 1986, virtually all deposit interest ceilings were phased out.29 Massive deposit outflows (disintermediation) due to the   
increasing disparity between market [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and the ${\sf R e g Q}$ ceilings were one justification for the phaseout (Mertens (2008) .  

# Capital Requirements  

In book-value terms, capital is the sum of retained earnings and paid-in capital, whereas in market value terms it is the current market price per share multiplied by the total number of shares outstanding. For regulatory purposes, however, capital also includes other items, as indicated below. For example, long-term debt (which includes mainly subordinated notes and debentures) is included; the rationale is that it is junior to deposits, so that a greater amount of long-term debt on the bank’s balance sheet implies greater protection for depositors. Hence, the regulatory rationale for including long-term debt in bank capital is that it serves to protect the depositors as well as the deposit insurer. As we will see, more recently, following the [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md), the definition of capital is narrowing and tends to exclude debt claims. The thinking is that debt, in whatever form, may cause [financial distress](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Southland%20Corp.%20(c).md), and ultimately threaten stability. Federal bank regulators make a distinction between Tier-1 and Tier-2 capital. Capital requirements apply to total (Tier-1 plus Tier-2) capital, with an upper limit on the amount of Tier-2 capital contributing to the total. In the box below, these two types of capital are defined.  

# Tier-1 and Tier-2 Capital  

Tier-1 (Core) Capital:  

Common Stock Retained Earnings Capital Surplus (amount received from sale of common stock or preferred stock in excess of par) Disclosed Capital Reserves (reserves set aside for cash dividends not declared plus amounts for unforeseen contingencies)  

Tier-2 (Supplementary) Capital:  

Loan and Lease Loss Allowances   
Preferred Stock with Maturity of at Least 20 Years   
Subordinated Obligations (Both Stock and Debt) With an Original Average Maturity of at Least 7 Years   
Undisclosed Capital Reserves   
Hybrid Capital Instruments (instruments that have [debt and equity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/I-%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20Markets%20and%20Intermediation/I-%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20Markets%20and%20Intermediation/Class%20Note%201-%20Borrower-Lender%20conflicts%20and%20implied%20agency%20problems.md) characteristics, but might be included in regulatory capital, e.g., [preference](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Utility%20Indices.md) shares, and convertible debt).  

Total Capital: Tier-1 Capital $^+$ Tier-2 Capital  

Until the 1980s, legal cash-asset reserve requirements were a more important constraint on bank’s balance sheets than capital requirements. To be sure, newly chartered banks had reasonably well-defined initial capital requirements, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had a capital standard that was similar to the present risk-related capital rules.  

Nevertheless, bank capital regulation was in striking contrast to thrift regulation where capital requirements had primacy over [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) requirements as a regulatory desideratum.  

This contrast reflected the traditional view that the principal risk in [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) was withdrawal risk rather than [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md), and the reverse was the presumption regarding thrifts. Commercial banks were designed to make short-term, selfliquidating business loans, financing trade, inventories, and receivables with highly predictable patterns of repayment. But LBO, LDC, commercial real estate, term lending, off-balance sheet activities, and BHC extensions into nonbank activities expanded the [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) [asset transformation](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Institutions%20Transforming%20Intermediar.md) of commercial banks.  

The banks’ expanded [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) implied greater exposure of the governmental safety net, and the [regulatory response](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Continental%20Illinois%20Case(1).md) was more stringent bank capital requirements. Bank shareholders were required to put up greater stakes in order to control [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) assets.  

The first effective nationwide capital requirement for commercial banks was mandated by the International [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Act (IBA) of 1978. Previously, the only federal capital standards were for newly chartered banks. Otherwise, capital standards were ad hoc, usually implemented as an incident to a BHC application. For example, if a BHC sought permission to acquire a mortgage [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) affiliate, the Federal Reserve would require additional capital in order to enter this new line of business.  

The 1978 legislation required bank capital of at least $5.5\%$ of total assets, and capital was defined to include paid-in equity, retained earnings, general (but not specific) loan-loss reserves, limited amounts of permanent stock, and certain classes of convertible long-term debt.  

# The Basel I Capital Accord  

Since 1978, bank capital has become a focal point of bank regulation. With increasing international competition among banks in a global market, public regulators have come to recognize the need to coordinate capital requirements for banks across countries. Hence, meetings were held among the United States, Japan, and the major Western European countries under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, in 1987. After long and arduous negotiations, the Basel (BIS) Accord provided a more-or-less uniform capital standard for all banks in the 12 participant countries. The new BIS (or Cooke, after the name of the British organizer) ratios were to be fully implemented by 1993 and to cover all insured banks. By 1993, all of the world’s major banks had satisfied the Basel capital requirements.30 The accord, now referred to as the Basel I Accord, was lauded as a great victory in international [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) cooperation and as the harbinger of the “[level playing field](../../Financial%20Engineering/An%20Introduction%20to%20Equity%20Markets.md).” Its main elements are summarized in Table 15.1. The definitions of Tier-1 capital are those given in the box earlier. The guidelines specifically exclude the following items (included in earlier capital ratio calculations) from the capital base for computing capital ratios: (i) goodwill, (ii) other intangibles, (iii) capital investments in most unconsolidated subsidiaries, (iv) reciprocal holdings of capital instruments in [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) organizations, and (v) revaluation reserves.  

The Basel I Accord relates required capital to the composition of the bank’s assets. Hence, capital requirements are stated as a percentage of risk-weighted assets rather than total assets. A bank’s risk-weighted assets are an average of the bank’s booked assets and credit equivalent amounts of its off-balance sheet exposure. There are five asset categories for risk-weighting purposes, numbered 1 through 5 in Table 15.1  The Basel I Accord called for a minimum overall riskweighted capital ratio of $8\%$ , with at least $50\%$ in the form of Tier-1 capital. To compute how much capital it needs, a bank must first determine the dollar volume of assets in each of the five risk categories. Say $\S A_{i}$ represents the dollar volume in risk category $i$ with $i=1,2,3,4 $ , or 5. Let $C_{i}$ represent the conversion factor for category $i$ that is, $C_{1}=0$ , $C_{2}=0.10$ , $C_{3}=0.2$ , $C_{4}=0.5$ , and $C_{5}=1.0$ . Then the total capital a bank is required to have is $8\%$ of $C_{1}A_{1}+C_{2}A_{2}+C_{3}A_{3}+C_{4}A_{4}+$ $C_{5}A_{5}$ or $0.08\times(C_{2}A_{2}+C_{3}A_{3}+C_{4}A_{4}+C_{5}A_{5})$ since $C_{1}=0$ . Moreover, the bank must have at least $0.04\times(C_{2}A_{2}+C_{3}A_{3}+$ $C_{4}A_{4}+C_{5}A_{5})$ as Tier-1 capital. U.S. [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) regulators have additionally imposed a Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) requirement in terms of a [leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) ratio constraint mandating that Tier-1 capital can be no lower than $3\%$ of total assets for banks earning the highest CAMEL rating. Other banks are required to keep a $4\%$ ratio. Weaker-rated banks may have to keep higher capital, as much as $6\%$ . Table 15.2 summarizes the three capital constraints U.S. banks face.  

Signatories to the Basel I Accord were free to impose higher capital requirements on banks in their own countries. As indicated previously, the capital requirements are risk sensitive for various classes of assets, both on- and off-[balance sheet items](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%206/Week%206%20Assignment%20Review.md). Although the focus of the Basel I capital requirement is [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md), limited recognition is also made of interestrate risk. For example, the capital requirement on federal [government debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Global%20Fixed%20Income%20Markets.md) with initial maturity exceeding 91  days is $0.8\%$ , whereas the requirement on shorter-maturity government debts is 0. The imposition of capital requirements on shorter-maturity government debts is 0. The imposition of capital requirements against off-[balance sheet items](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%206/Week%206%20Assignment%20Review.md) (e.g., loan commitments, standby L/Cs, and interest-rate and [currency swaps](../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md)) is another innovation of the Basel I requirements.

where $^{\prime\prime}M\mathbf{a}\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}$ means the greater of the two enclosed quantities in the parenthesis. The bank’s capital must then satisfy both   
(1) and (4), above.  

From one perspective, capital requirements look like a naïve first step in international [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) cooperation. There are numerous criticisms. First, the risk classes are crude to the point of inviting exploitation. Mortgages require half the capital of business loans, yet it is easy to find mortgages with greater [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) than business loans. Indeed, at the margin, business loans can be repackaged in the form of mortgages. Regulators always seem to underestimate the adroitness and plasticity of the capital markets. Loans are merely written contracts that can be adapted to meet the imperatives of the moment.  

Second, the risk classes can be manipulated.31 For instance, suppose a bank invests in U.S. Treasury bonds that require zero capital and then enters into an amortizing swap (recall Chapter 8) in which it pays the total return on those bonds and receives the total payments on mortgages. Even though this bank effectively holds mortgages, the bank faces a BIS capital requirement that is lower than the $4\%$ attached to mortgages.  

Third, interest-rate risk failed to receive its due under Basel I, although the 1991 legislation mandates that regulators develop new capital guidelines that reflect interest-rate risk as well as [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md).  

Fourth, many concessions were made to accommodate special interests. For example, $45\%$ of unrecorded capital gains on equity holdings can be counted as Tier-2 capital. This concession was especially important to Japanese banks with large equity holdings valued at purchase prices. U.S. banks are prohibited from treating unrealized capital gains as capital.  

Fifth, the Basel I capital requirements assume that [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) risk is substantially the same in different countries. However, there are striking differences in the variability of bank rates of return across countries. This suggests that the basic asset-risk categories may be too crude and that minimum capital ratios should vary across countries.  

Finally, since the capital ratios are prescribed on a book-value basis, they fail to adjust for changing return volatilities and the relationship between book and market values of bank equity. Moreover, the capital requirements do not recognize the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) aspects of bank balance sheets. Since requirements are linear in individual asset categories, there is no recognition of the covariability of [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) that affects diversification and [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) risk.  

Despite these shortcomings, the accord is noteworthy as a historic first step in the international harmonization of capital standards, linking capital to risk, and in recognizing the significance of off-[balance sheet items](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%206/Week%206%20Assignment%20Review.md). As it turned out, it was basically only a first step, as a revised accord, the Basel II Accord, was adopted in 2004; this will be discussed next. Note also that the PCA requirements of FDICIA increase the importance of capital since regulators are required to close banks with sufficiently deficient capital.  

# The Basel II Capital Accord  

In June 2004, central bank governors and heads of bank supervisory authorities in the Group of Ten (G10) countries issued a press release and endorsed the publication of International Convergence of Capital Management and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework, a new capital adequacy framework, commonly known as Basel II. The planned implementation of the basic approach was to be completed by the end of 2006, with the more advanced approaches to be adopted by end of 2007.32 Basel II is viewed by many as the outcome of a process of evolution started by Basel I.  

Objectives of Basel II: Basel II has numerous objectives. The main ones are listed below:  

Ensure that capital adequacy regulation is not a source of competitive disadvantage.  Adopt more risk-sensitive capital requirements.  Make greater use of banks’ own internal risk assessments.  Bring market discipline and regulatory monitoring to bear as part of regulation to ensure prudent risk-taking rather than relying solely on capital requirements.  Cover a more comprehensive set of risks, including [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md), [interest rate risk](../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md), and operational risk.  Account for the risk-mitigation efforts of banks.  Adopt a more forward-looking approach that can evolve with time.  

The Three Pillars of Basel II: Basel I focused exclusively on bank capital requirements. In contrast, Basel II takes a more comprehensive approach, relying on three “pillars” to ensure appropriate risk-taking by banks. These three pillars are:  

First pillar: Minimum Capital Requirements; Second pillar: Supervisory Review Process; and Third pillar: Disclosure (or Market Discipline).  

The idea is that regulators are supposed to rely on three mechanisms for controlling bank risk: capital requirements (as in Basel I, but with modifications to link capital requirements to a broader array of risks than just [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md)), regulatory monitoring, and market discipline. We discuss each pillar briefly in what follows. The interested reader should visit the Bank for International Settlements Web site for a more detailed discussion.  

The First Pillar: Minimum Capital Requirements: Total minimum capital requirements have to be calculated for credit, market, and operational risks. The capital ratio is calculated using the definitions of regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets. The total capital ratio must be no lower than $8\%$ . Tier-2 capital is limited to $100\%$ of Tier-1 capital.  

With a few modifications, the definition of eligible regulatory capital is essentially the same as in the 1988 Basel I Accord.33  

Basel II defines Risk-Weighted Assets as  

Total Risk-Weighted Assets $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ [Risk-weighted assets determined by [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) $\mathrm{J}+[12.5\times\mathrm{C}$ apital requirement for market and operational risks].  

Note that the number 12.5 above is the reciprocal of the minimum capital requirement of $8\%$ .  

Determination of risk-weighted assets for [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) is as follows. Banks are allowed a choice between two broad methodologies for calculating their capital requirements for [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md): the standardized approach and the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach. We consider the standardized approach first. In Table 15.3  we provide the weights to be assigned for different kinds of credits under this approach.  

TABLE 15.3 Risk weights for different credits under the standardized approach   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Types of Claims</td><td>Risk Weights Assigned</td></tr><tr><td>1. Claims on sovereign governments and their central banks</td><td>Depends on credit ratings: 0% for AAA to AA-; 20% for A+ to A-; 5O% for BBB+ to BBB-; 100% for BB + to B-; 150% below B-; and 100% if unrated.</td></tr><tr><td>2.

33  An example of a deviation is that under one of the permissible approaches (the internal ratings-based approach, IRB), general loan-loss reserves cannot be included in Tier-2 capital.  

In addition to stipulating risk weights to reflect credit risks embedded in a variety of different assets, Basel II also recognizes that the risk mitigation efforts of banks can affect their risk exposure, and seeks to account for this in the computation of minimum capital requirements. For example, the bank may be able to lower the capital it posts against a transaction if it is collateralized, that is, the bank’s credit exposure is limited by collateral. If, however, the claim in question has an issuespecific rating that reflects the bank’s risk mitigation efforts, then no additional capital reduction is granted beyond what is already made possible by the effect of the risk mitigation on the credit rating.  

Next, we turn to the IRB approach to [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md). This approach permits some banks to rely on their own estimates of risk components in determining the capital requirement for a given exposure, as long as the banks using this approach meet certain conditions and disclosure requirements. The risk components in the IRB approach include measures of the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), the exposure at default (EAD), and effective maturity (M). In some cases, banks may be required to use a supervisory value as opposed to an internal estimate for one or more of the risk components.  

The first step in the IRB approach is to categorize [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md)-book exposures into broad classes of assets with different underlying risk characteristics: corporate, sovereign, bank, retail, and equity. Within those broad classes, there are subcategories. For each of these asset classes, there are three key elements:  

 Risk Components: estimates of risk parameters provided by banks, some of which are supervisory estimates;  Risk-Weighted Functions: the means by which risk components are transformed into risk-weighted assets and therefore capital requirements; Minimum Requirements: the minimum standards that must be met in order for a bank to use the IRB approach.  

For many of the asset classes, there are two broad approaches within the IRB approach: a foundation approach and an advanced approach. Under the foundation approach, as a general rule, banks provide their own estimates of PD and rely on supervisory estimates for other risk components. Under the advanced approach, banks provide more of their own estimates of PG, LGD, and EAD, and their own calculation of maturity M.  

[Securitization](../../Financial%20Engineering/10.%20Other%20Topics%20in%20Quantitative%20Finance.md) receives special treatment under Basel II. Banks are required to determine [regulatory capital requirements](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock.md) on exposures arising from traditional and synthetic securitizations, keeping in mind the economic substance of the [securitization](../../Financial%20Engineering/10.%20Other%20Topics%20in%20Quantitative%20Finance.md) rather than its legal form. The [securitization structures](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/I-%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20Markets%20and%20Intermediation/I-%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20Markets%20and%20Intermediation/Lecture%20Note%201-%20Debt%20Pricing.md) subject to capital requirements include exposures arising from the provision of credit-risk mitigants to a [securitization](../../Financial%20Engineering/10.%20Other%20Topics%20in%20Quantitative%20Finance.md) transaction, investments in [asset-backed](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) securities (ABS), retention of a subordinated tranche, and extension of a [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) facility or [credit enhancement](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%20On%20Securitization(1).md). The actual capital requirements against these exposures depend on the credit ratings of the exposures.  

Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems, or from external events. It includes legal risk, but excludes strategic and reputational risk. Several approaches for determining the capital requirements against operational risk are included in Basel II (see the box below for details).  

# Box: Capital requirements for operational risk  

Basel II dictates three methods for calculating operational risk capital charges: (i) the Basic Indicator Approach; (ii) the Standardized Approach; and (iii) Advanced Measurement Approaches (AMA). Banks are encouraged to move along the continuum of available approaches as they develop more sophisticated operational risk measurement systems and practices, with specific qualifying criteria specified for the Standardized Approach and the AMA.  

Under the Basic Indicator Approach, the bank must hold capital for operational risk equal to $15\%$ of the positive average annual gross income for the previous three years. Figures for any year in which annual gross income is negative are excluded.  

Under the Standardized Approach, banks’ activities are divided into eight business lines: [corporate finance](../../Course%20Notes/Corporate%20Finance%20Lecture%20Notes.md), trading and sales, retail [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md), commercial [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md), payment and settlement, agency services, asset management, and retail brokerage. The total capital charge is calculated as the 3-year average of the simple sum of the regulatory capital charges across each of the business lines in each year. In any given year, negative capital charges (resulting from negative gross income) in any business line may offset positive capital charges in other business lines without limit. However, when the aggregate capital charge across all business lines within a given year is negative, then that year is excluded from the calculations. The percentages of gross income to be kept as capital vary across business lines.34  

Under the AMA, the regulatory capital requirement equals the [risk measure](../../Financial%20Instruments/Leverage%20as%20a%20Measure%20of%20Risk.md) generated by the bank’s internal operational risk measurement system. Use of the AMA is subject to supervisory approval.  

Basel II also includes capital requirements against [market risk](../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%205%20-%20Index%20Futures.md). Under Basel II, banks are required to have procedures that enable them to assess and actively manage all material market risks. The assessment of internal capital adequacy for [market risk](../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%205%20-%20Index%20Futures.md) should be based on both Value-at-Risk (VAR) modeling and stress testing, including an assessment of concentration risk and assessment of illiquidity under stressful market scenarios. The bank’s internal capital assessment is required to demonstrate that it has enough capital to not only meet the minimum capital requirements but also to withstand a range of severe but plausible market shocks.35  

The Second Pillar: Supervisory Review Process: The supervisory review process of Basel II is intended to ensure that banks have adequate capital to support all the risks in their business, but also to encourage banks to develop and use better risk-management techniques in monitoring and managing their risks. This review process recognizes the responsibility of [bank management](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2013%20-%20Banks%20Asset-Liability%20Management/Banks%20Asset-Liability%20Management.md) in developing an internal capital assessment process and setting appropriate capital targets.  

Supervisors are expected to evaluate how well banks are assessing their capital needs relative to their risks and to intervene when appropriate. This interaction is intended to foster an active dialog between banks and supervisors such that when deficiencies are identified, PCA can be taken to either reduce risk or restore capital.  

There are three main areas that might be particularly suited to treatment under Pillar 2: risks considered under Pillar 1 that are not fully captured by the Pillar 1 process (e.g., credit concentration risk), factors not accounted for by Pillar 1 (e.g., interestrate risk in the [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) book, business and strategic risk), and factors external to the bank (e.g., [business cycle](../../International%20Finance/Economic%20Stabilization%20Notes/Business%20Cycles-%20Introduction,%20Characteristics,%20and%20History.md) effects). Moreover, Pillar 2 also involves an assessment by regulators of compliance with the minimum standards and disclosure requirements of the more advanced methods in Pillar 1, such as the IRB framework for [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) and the treatment of operational risk.  

Basel II also cautions bank supervisors to carry out their obligations in a transparent and accountable manner. Moreover, it encourages enhanced cooperation between national supervisors, especially for the cross-border supervision of complex international [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) organizations.  

The Third Pillar: Disclosure (or Market Discipline): Given the increasing complexity of [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) activities, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) supervisors to monitor these activities in detail. Basel II therefore seeks to encourage market discipline by asking for more transparency and disclosure. In doing so, it hopes to encourage monitoring of banks by professional investors and financial analysts as a complement to [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) supervision. However, this is where Basel II provides the least detail and precision. Other than emphasizing the need for increased transparency and disclosure, it says little about how to make it effective.36  

# The Basel III Capital Accord  

The [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) highlighted substantial shortcomings in the regulation of banks and the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md). Basel II, introduced on the verge of the 2007–2009 [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md), did not escape criticism. It is criticized for amounting to little more than lightweight procyclical bank capital regulation with ample possibilities for regulatory [arbitrage](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md),37 and as such has contributed to banks being undercapitalized and unable to weather a serious economic storm. In particular, the “model-based” approaches were criticized as being easily manipulated and producing excessively optimistic assessments of risk in good times (and hence low capital requirements). The latter created substantial procyclicality in the operations of banks. Also the “quality” of capital was criticized – debt-like sources of financing were still allowed to be counted in meeting capital requirements. Criticism was that the focus on models that needed to be certified by regulators led to a standardization of these models possibly forcing greater similarity in bank strategies. This could make bank [asset portfolio](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/The%20Barbell%20Versus%20the%20Bullet.md) choice become more highly correlated and elevate systemic risk. Finally, counterparty risk was inadequately addressed, which threatened not just the safety and soundness of individual [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) but also the stability of the system at large. As a response, the Basel Committee proposed the new Basel III Capital Accord on 1 June, 2011 (see BCBS (2011, 2012)).  

The Basel III Capital Accord works to strengthen the global capital framework by raising the quality of bank capital, enhancing risk coverage, and adding a [leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) ratio that is not model-based.  

Raising the quality of bank capital: The total regulatory capital comprises Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital is seen as high-quality bank capital; that is, bank capital that is able to absorb losses on a going concern basis (i.e., under normal operations of the bank). In contrast, Tier 2 capital is lower-quality bank capital; that is, bank capital that is able to absorb bank losses on a gone-concern basis (i.e., if the bank enters the insolvency procedures) and thus does not prevent [financial distress](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Southland%20Corp.%20(c).md) but provides some protection to depositors.  

Definitions of bank capital (and its decomposition into high-quality-Tier-1 and low-quality-Tier-2 capital) were imprecise and varied substantially across countries before the 2007–2009 crisis. This created two problems. First, it was difficult to compare the levels of bank capital across banks and [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) systems as indicators of comparative or relative bank stability. Second, banks could engage in capital [arbitrage](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) by letting various nonequity sources of funding qualify as bank capital. To deal with these problems, the Basel III Capital Accord more clearly defines which funding sources can count as bank capital and focuses more on the highest quality tier of bank capital (i.e., Tier-1 bank capital). In particular, Tier-1 capital is supplanted by Common Equity Tier-1 capital which comprises common shares, retained earnings, and stock surplus, accumulated other comprehensive income and other disclosed reserves, and regulatory adjustments.  

Additional Tier 1 bank capital, which comprises hybrid instruments that need to be among others: (1) subordinated to depositors, general creditors, and subordinated debtholders of the bank, (2) perpetual without incentives to redeem, and (3) the bank needs to contain full discretion with respect to dividend/[coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md). The latter requires that dividends/ coupons must be paid out of distributable income available for payment to common shareholders, and nonpayment of dividends cannot impose any restriction on the bank (except for triggering nonpayment of dividend to common shareholders).  

A major change compared to the Basel II Capital Accord pertains to the phase out of Tier-1 bank capital hybrid capital instruments that have redemption incentives (due to step-up clauses). Basel II also permitted “Tier-3 bank capital” to cover market risks (Tier-3 bank capital included general loss reserves, undisclosed reserves, and a greater variety of subordinated debt). Tier-3 bank capital is now abolished under Basel III. In addition, Tier-2 bank capital is to be better synchronized across jurisdictions.  

The main task of Tier-2 capital is to cover the losses of depositors or general creditors of the bank in the case of default. Therefore, the Basel III Capital Accord stipulates that Tier-2 bank capital needs to be subordinate to depositors and general creditors of the bank. It should not be securitized to enhance its seniority. It should have a minimum maturity of at least 5 years and can be callable only after 5 years. The buyer of Tier-2 capital should not be the issuing bank or a related party neither should the issuing bank provide funds for its purchase.38  

Raising the quantity of bank capital: The Basel III Capital Accord demands from banks to have Common equity Tier-1 capital of at least $4.5\%$ of risk-weighted assets. Tier-1 capital to risk weighted assets must be at least $6\%$ and Total capital to risk-weighted assets must be at least $8\%$ .  

Enhancing Risk Coverage: In addition to raising the quantity and quality of bank capital, it is crucial that capital regulation covers the main risk exposures of banks. The [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) has shown that several on-balance sheet and offbalance sheet risks were largely unaccounted for. Therefore, the Basel III Capital Accord aims at [raising capital](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%206/Week%206%20Assignment%20Review.md) to improve its risk coverage function, especially with respect to complex [financial derivatives](../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md) holdings and for the trading book.  

Banks need to compute their minimum capital requirements for counterparty [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) using stressed value-at-risk capital requirements. Stressed VAR capital requirements are computed on a continuous 12-month period of significant financial stress. The idea behind the stressed VAR capital requirements is to build up sufficient capital to weather a prolonged period of [financial distress](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Southland%20Corp.%20(c).md).  

Whereas the Basel II Capital Accord obliged banks to provide a capital cushion to cover potential [default risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md) of a counterparty, the [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) of 2007–2009 has shown that the deterioration of the credit standing of a counterparty (and not necessarily its default) can already put a bank under substantial stress. Therefore, the Basel III Capital Accord stipulates from banks to build sufficient capital to cover mark-to-market losses (so-called credit valuation adjustment CVA risk) due to a decrease in the credit worthiness of a counterparty. The Basel III Capital Accord also prescribes a methodology to deal with the so-called wrong-way risks. Wrong-way risks are defined as situations in which exposure increases with the deterioration of the credit standing of the counterparty. Standards for collateral risk-management practices are also being improved.  

The Basel III Capital Accord also addresses systemic risk within the [banking system](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Class%20Slide%203%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md). It raises the capital requirements for bilateral OTC [derivatives](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) exposures, giving strong incentives to banks to move derivative exposures to central counterparties (such as clearing houses). The central counterparties will also need to comply with rigorous standards (such as capital requirements) in order to ensure a robust financial [market infrastructure](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%203%20Financial%20Market%20Utilities.md).  

[Leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) ratio: The problems with risk-based capital regulation – including potential procyclicality, complexity, manipulation,39 and uncertainties about the reliability of internal models used by banks– created a desire for a complementary capital requirement that was simpler and more basic. As a response, the Basel III Capital Accord includes the minimum unweighted [leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) ratio as an additional requirement on capital. The [leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) ratio is computed as follows:  
$$
{\mathrm{Leverage~ratio}}={\frac{\mathrm{Capital~measure}}{\mathrm{Exposure~measure}}}
$$  

Basically, a [leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) ratio is closest in spirit to a book equity-to-total-assets ratio familiar to those used to thinking about [capital structure](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md) issues for nonfinancial firms.  

In particular, banks need to have a [leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) ratio of at least $3\%$ . The capital measure for the [leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) ratio is Tier-1 capital as defined in the Basel III Capital Accord and described above. The “exposure measure” is the sum of on-balance sheet exposures (all [balance sheet items](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%206/Week%206%20Assignment%20Review.md) with some adjustments), [derivatives](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) exposures, securities financing transactions (i.e., [repurchase agreements](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Slides%20On%20Repurchase%20Agreements.md), reverse [repurchase agreements](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Slides%20On%20Repurchase%20Agreements.md), security lending and borrowing) exposures, and off-[balance sheet items](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%206/Week%206%20Assignment%20Review.md). Thus, basically the [leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) ratio is the Tier-1 capital relative to the total exposures of a bank, including accounting [balance sheet items](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%206/Week%206%20Assignment%20Review.md) as well as off-[balance sheet items](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%206/Week%206%20Assignment%20Review.md).  

In recent further amendments to Basel III, it is proposed to add [floors](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Caps%20and%20Floors.md) to the IRB approach in order to alleviate concerns about the low levels of capital that the risk weighted approach may dictate.  In addition, extra capital thresholds and loss absorption capacity (TLAC) are prescribed.  

In addition, the Basel III Capital Accord aims at lowering the procyclicality of the risk-based capital regulation by adding countercyclical capital buffers, lowering cyclicality of the minimum capital requirements, including forward-looking provisioning and increasing capital conservation. For further discussion of how Basel III reduces procyclicality, see the section “Stability: Macroprudential Regulation” later in this chapter. Another notable feature is that the Basel III Capital Accord introduces global [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) regulation, which is described in the next section.  

# Liquidity regulation  

Historically, [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) regulation was primarily considered a tool of [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md), and only secondarily as a prudential regulation tool. Nevertheless, safeguarding adequate [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) was deemed important. In the period leading up to the 2007–2009 [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md), banks appeared to have easy access to [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) in well-developed [financial markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md).40 However, the [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) pointed at a [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md) that could experience a [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) crunch and [financial markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) that were not as resilient as previously thought, that is, freezes of [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) were observed, making access to [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) through [financial markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) difficult and expensive. In particular, a fundamental weakness of institutions relying largely on short-term borrowing in [financial markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) – also called wholesale financing – became apparent. Many [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md), with the [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) bank Lehman Brothers and the UK lender Northern Rock as most noteworthy examples, had funded themselves massively on a very short-term basis, usually overnight borrowing, while at the same time investing heavily in long-term assets, such as real-estate mortgages and collateral debt obligations. When serious doubts about the [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) of these assets surfaced, concerns about the insolvency risk of these institutions were elevated and the short-term funding market essentially froze as a consequence for these institutions, generating immense pressure on their ability to refinance and hence stability. Northern Rock even faced a real [bank run](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) with depositors lining up in front of its premises. Lehman did not fare much better. Counterparties withdrew funding, exacerbating the [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) problems. The very low levels of capital in these institutions amplified the stress and generated a full-blown confidence crisis. Other [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) faced similar stress and resorted to asset sales (in order to compensate for lack of funding) that reinforced falling asset values, and further undermined the stability of these [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) and the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md) at large. This was a classic case of a combination of maturity mismatching, excessive [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md), and very low capital levels combining to elevate concerns about possible insolvency, and consequently creating a [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) squeeze.  

The capital regulation that existed at the time clearly proved inadequate to deal with instabilities that arose due to the maturity mismatch between the assets and liabilities of a financial institution. The freezing of [funding markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Runs%20and%20Interventions%20in%20the%20Time%20of%20Covid%2019%20Evidence%20From%20Money%20Funds.md) and the forced asset sales, with their depressing effect on asset prices, made even adequately capitalized institutions feel the stress and suffer to some extent from the crisis of confidence.41  

The lessons were clear. Both capital regulation and [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) regulation needed to be strengthened. To that end, the Basel III Capital Accord introduced two [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) measures: the [liquidity coverage ratio](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Liquidity%20Management%20and%20Currentregulatory%20Iss.md) (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). The NSFR requires banks to have sufficiently [stable funding sources](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Liquidity%20Management%20and%20Currentregulatory%20Iss.md) relative to the [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) profile of its assets over a 1-year period. This seeks to prevent (short-maturity) wholesale funding being used for long-maturity assets.  

Whereas the NSFR will require banks to implement sustainable maturity structures over longer time horizons, the LCR promotes the short-term resilience of a bank faced with [liquidity risk](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md). In particular, the LCR requires a bank to have enough [high-quality liquid assets](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Liquidity%20Management%20and%20Currentregulatory%20Iss.md) (HQLA) to fund itself through a highly illiquid period of 30 days.  

The LCR needs to be bigger than or equal to 1, where the LCR is defined as42  
$$
\mathrm{LCR}={\frac{\mathrm{Stock~of~HQLA}}{\mathrm{Total~net~cash~outflows~over~the~next~30~calendar~days}}}
$$  

The stock of HQLA is defined as the assets that are liquid in markets even during severe distress and ideally are eligible as collateral for central bank operations. Their fundamental characteristics are low risk, ease and certainty of valuation, and low correlation with risky assets. Ideally, these assets are listed on developed exchanges.  

The Basel III Capital Accord distinguishes between two categories of HQLA. Level 1 HQLA can be included without limit, whereas Level 2 HQLA can be included only up to $40\%$ of all HQLA. Assets classified as Level 1 HQLA are coins and banknotes, central bank reserves, and high-quality (liquid and traded in large volumes) marketable securities (claims on governments or guaranteed by governments, central banks, public sector enterprises, IMF, ECB) with assigned $0\%$ risk weight under the Basel II Accord.43 No haircut is applied to Level 1 HQLA.  

At the discretion of a bank supervisor, Level 2 HQLA can be further decomposed into two buckets: standard Level 2A and lower quality Level 2B assets. Level 2B assets should not exceed $15\%$ of total HQLA. Assets classified as Level 2A  HQLA are high-quality (liquid and highly traded) market securities with assigned $20\%$ risk weight under Basel II and high-quality [corporate debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) securities with a credit rating of at least AA – and should not be issued by the bank itself. A haircut of $15\%$ is applied to Level 2A HQLA.  

Assets classified as Level 2B under the discretion of the supervisor need to be subject to a higher haircut: residential mortgage backed securities ( $25\%$ haircut), [corporate debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) securities with credit rating between $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{+}$ and BBB- $50\%$ haircut), and common equity shares $50\%$ haircut). These assets are subject to additional requirements that assure that they act as liquid assets in time of [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) shortages. All Level 1 and Level 2 securities should trade in deep markets with high [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md).  

The denominator in the [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) ratio LCR is defined as  

Total net cash outflow over the next 30 calendar days $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ Total expected cash outflows – Min {total expected cash inflows; $75\%$ of total expected cash outflows},  

where the “min” operator – which means choosing the minimum of the two quantities in the curly brackets – ensures that the total net cash outflow in the denominator is at least $25\%$ of the gross outflow. The total expected cash outflows are computed by multiplying the amounts of funding sources by their corresponding run-off rates. Fully insured retail deposits, socalled “stable deposits,” receive at least $3\%$ but usually $5\%$ run-off rate. Uninsured or partially insured deposits, so-called less stable deposits, receive a minimum of $10\%$ run-off rates. Unsecured wholesale funding with a maturity within 30 days (or being callable within this period) generally receives $100\%$ run-off rate.44  

In addition to LCR, the [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) regulation under the Basel III Capital Accord sets several monitoring tools that can be used by the bank supervisors in supervision:  

Contractual maturity mismatch identifies maturity mismatch within the predefined time buckets Concentration of funding identifies the extent of exposure to counterparties that provide majority of funds (including the exposure [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) risk)  

Available unencumbered assets identify the amount of assets that are available to be pledged as a collateral if there is a need to raise additional funding   
LCR by significant [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) to monitor [liquidity risk](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) within certain currencies   
Market-related monitoring tools to use market data as an early indication of [liquidity risk](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) within a bank.  

# Bank Activity Restrictions  

The legal separation of commercial and [investment banking](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209-%20Corporate%20Securities%20And%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) in the United States was memorialized with the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933. Federal Reserve member banks were prohibited from underwriting, distributing, or dealing in stocks, bonds, or other securities, the exceptions being U.S. government bonds, general obligation [municipal securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md), and the obligations of specified government agencies. [The act](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/The%20Dodd%20Frank%20Act%20and%20Its%20Impact.md) also prohibited banks from affiliating with [investment banking](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209-%20Corporate%20Securities%20And%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) firms or otherwise engaging in [investment banking](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209-%20Corporate%20Securities%20And%20Credit%20Derivatives.md). The separation of commercial and [investment banking](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209-%20Corporate%20Securities%20And%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) was based on the controversial notion that the massive [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) disruption of the period was due to the securities activities of banks.  

The Glass–Steagall Act also affirmed the authority of the states regarding geographic expansion, originally spelled out by the McFadden Act in 1927. Thus, branching and holding company issues were deferred to the states, effectively blocking the development of interstate [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) and ensuring a fragmented industry. The assets that banks could intermediate as well as their geographic origin were severely restricted. This meant that banks were closely tied to the fortunes of their local communities, and the opportunities for diversification were limited, as were opportunities to exploit economies of scale and scope.45 Notably, the restrictions were based on an increasingly tenuous distinction between loans and securities. Private placements of [debt securities](../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) are, for all practical purposes, loans, and securitized loans are, for all practical purposes, securities. The all-but-vacuous distinction between loans and [debt securities](../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) was not lost on bankers seeking to expand their activities.  

A relentless testing of limits by bankers prompted regulatory reinterpretations through time, leading to bank entry into a variety of previously prohibited areas. For example, through holding company affiliates, banks were able to underwrite municipal debt, commercial paper, and even corporate bonds and equity, within strict limit as to the volume of this business. Without the benefit of legislation, the rules governing asset proscriptions were substantially relaxed by regulators. To be sure, these initiatives were tested in the courts, but the regulatory liberalizations were judicially sustained for the most part. This is actually quite remarkable because the reinterpretations of the 1930s legislation were fundamental. Underwriting [corporate debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) and equity securities by commercial banks and their holding companies was for decades simply illegal under Glass–Steagall. When the banks and their regulators sought to have the law liberalized, their efforts were wasted time and again by a variety of other interest groups. Then, however, the bank regulators simply reinterpreted Glass–Steagall, and the courts upheld their prerogative to do so.  

The once impregnable wall separating commercial and [investment banking](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209-%20Corporate%20Securities%20And%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) was dismantled piecemeal, without legislation. Likewise, banks found their way into the asset-management business via mutual funds. Banks could sell and manage mutual funds. This too was thought to be foreclosed by Glass–Steagall. The separation of [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) and insurance proved to be more stubborn. Lobbying by insurance interests kept banks out of this business for the most part. However, banks competed vigorously in the business of financial guarantees. Moreover, some insurance companies offered depository [financial intermediation](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20as%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) services.46 Standby letters of credit sold by banks and financial guarantees sold by insurance companies are close substitutes, especially as credit enhancements for [securitization](../../Financial%20Engineering/10.%20Other%20Topics%20in%20Quantitative%20Finance.md).47 Likewise, banks and insurance companies competed directly in the market for annuities.  

Prior to the dismantling of the Glass–Steagall Act, the expanding securities activities of banks were being forced into holding company affiliates in order to achieve a measure of separation (see the box on Holding Companies and Separability) between the deposit-taking bank and its nontraditional activities.  

# Bank holding companies and separability  

BHC legislation of 1956 and 1970 clearly established the Federal Reserve as the primary federal bank regulatory agency. The BHC Act of 1956 brought the multi-BHC under the supervision of the Federal Reserve. All holding company formations and their bank acquisitions thereafter required the explicit permission of the Federal Reserve. What the 1956 legislation did not anticipate was the use of the BHC for purposes other than the purchase of banks. In the 1960s, there emerged a new kind of BHC, referred to as the one-BHC. It was used for a variety of circumventing purposes. For example, one-BHCs issued commercial paper, which banks were not permitted to do. They downstreamed the proceeds to their affiliate bank, which issued nondeposit liabilities for the proceeds of the commercial paper. The banks thereby avoided cash-asset reserve requirements against these liabilities.  

The one-BHC also was a vehicle for increasing [financial leverage](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Leverage%20Ratio.md). By purchasing the banks’ equity with a mix of holding company [debt and equity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/I-%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20Markets%20and%20Intermediation/I-%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20Markets%20and%20Intermediation/Class%20Note%201-%20Borrower-Lender%20conflicts%20and%20implied%20agency%20problems.md), the banks’ owners increased their [leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md). The holding company also was used as a tax shield in that dividends from the bank to the holding company could be used to retire holding company debt without being taxed as income to the holding company owners.  

Finally, the one-BHC was used to expand the powers of banks. BHCs purchased travel agencies, consulting companies, securities affiliates, and other businesses that banks would not have been permitted to purchase directly. Not surprisingly, one-BHCs experienced rapid growth after the 1956 legislation.48 The 1970 Douglas Amendments to the BHC Act brought one-BHCs under the supervision of the Federal Reserve. Thereafter, all holding company formations and all acquisitions, bank or nonbank entities, would require the explicit permission of the Federal Reserve. As indicated earlier, the vagueness of BHC legislation gave the Federal Reserve expansive discretionary powers. Prior to the bank capital requirements legislated in 1978, BHC applications became the Federal Reserve’s foremost lever for coercing additional capital into the banks.  

Both public regulators and the banks themselves often prefer to lodge less traditional activities in a separately incorporated holding company subsidiary instead of having the bank itself engage in new businesses. The rationale is based on two considerations. First, the holding company is viewed as a “source of strength.”49 According to Regulation Y of the Federal Reserve, “A BHC shall serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary.” Second, prohibiting the bank from engaging directly in an activity achieves a measure of separation so that if something goes wrong at the new business, the bank, where most of the assets and net worth usually reside, will be insulated from the adversity.  

But is it possible to insulate the bank in this fashion? This will depend on a variety of considerations. First, is the question of whether creditors of the subsidiary have legal remedy against the bank and/or the holding company. This is an issue the lawyers call “piercing the corporate veil.” The courts usually respect the legal partitioning of related companies, but this depends on how the courts may act on such representations. The company’s advertising may well influence the courts in deciding whether to respect the format separation. Thus, if a bank gives the public to understand that it stands behind the commitments of a subsidiary, the courts might feel justified in permitting creditors of the subsidiary to seek satisfaction from the bank or the holding company. The standards in this area are of necessity judgmental and less than clearly defined.  

Perhaps even more important than legal considerations are the reputational issues. For example, will adversity at some nonbank subsidiary result in higher costs or lost business to other holding company affiliates? The failure of a subsidiary might lead to downgrading in the credit rating of the parent or the bank affiliate. In order to forestall such a possibility, the management of the parent might voluntarily divert resources to support the floundering subsidiary. Either one of these possibilities, the customer’s reaction or the voluntary diversion of resources to support the floundering subsidiary, would subvert the separation achieved by the holding company structure.  

Hence, the holding company’s ability to insulate members can easily be overstated, and often is. Those who argue that banks can be permitted to do any legal businesses with impunity so long as the nonbank activities are isolated in holding company subsidiaries fail to appreciate the fragility of the separation provided by the holding company structure.  

Ultimately, the Glass–Steagall Act was dismantled in 1999, with the passage of the [Financial Services](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) Modernization Act of 1999. This act is also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999, to reflect the names of the senators who sponsored the bill. This legislation repealed Sections 20 and 32 of the Glass–Steagall Act. It further authorizes a wide range of activities for BHCs and foreign banks that meet eligibility criteria.  

In the case of such organizations, it allows United States financial service providers, including banks, securities firms, and insurance companies to affiliate with each other and enter into each other’s markets. The affiliation of [financial services](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) providers allows open and free competition in the [financial services](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) industry.  

The 2007–2009 [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) has revived the idea of structural separation of activities in [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md). Several trading and more transaction-oriented activities, such as investments in [financial derivatives](../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md), engagement in [structured finance](../../Financial%20Engineering/A%20Primer%20on%20Structured%20Finance.md) products and activities, and risky trading on [financial markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md), imposed substantial risk and losses on banks and it is perceived that they contributed to an increased fragility of the financial systems during and leading up to the crisis. Regulators in different countries all recognized the importance of these root causes but approached the problem of dealing with these root causes differently. We focus here on three major initiatives: the Volcker rule in the U.S. (part of the Dodd–Frank Act that was a legislative response to the crisis), recommendations by the Vickers Commission in the United Kingdom, and the Liikanen proposals in the EU.  

The Volcker Rule: In the United States, Section 619 of the Dodd–Frank Act, the so-called Volcker Rule, prohibits the involvement of any bank in proprietary trading, which is trading for profit on [financial markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) for its own account. In addition, the Volker Rule prohibits an ownership in [hedge funds](../../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) or [private equity](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2014%20-%20Private%20Equity,%20Pension,%20and%20Sovereign%20Funds/Private%20Equity.md) funds.  

The main idea behind the Volker Rule is to protect the stability of the financial sector and the government safety net (“the tax payer”) against risks stemming from (opportunistic) speculative activities. It recognizes that banks can use their core [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) activities, including the supporting government safety net, to support highly risky trading activities. The Volcker Rule seeks to address the issue by separating trading from [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) activities. Whether this can be done effectively is still open for debate. Actually, the implementation of the Dodd–Frank Act will take some time.  

Several exemptions exist to the Volcker Rule to deal with grey areas. An important one is “market making,” which involves the bank participating in trades to provide continuity and [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) to the market in a security. For example, the bank can keep some securities in inventory to satisfy customers’ purchase orders in the future or absorb the supply of securities from a customer who wishes to sell even when there is no buyer on the other side of the transaction. Another exemption is when trading is used for [hedging](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) purposes rather than for speculation. The idea behind the [hedging](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) exemption is clear: banks should be allowed to manage and lower their risk exposures. Thus, permitted activities include investments for market making and underwriting activities, trading in the name of bank clients, and trading in the U.S. [government debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Global%20Fixed%20Income%20Markets.md) instruments ([Financial Stability](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) Board (2012)).  

In practice, the distinction between permitted and prohibited activities by the Volcker Rule is difficult to make, which led to substantial complexity in the operational formulation of rule and ongoing challenges with respect to its implementation. The rule came into effect as of April 1, 2014.50 For example, how do you determine whether the bank was [hedging](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) or speculating? How do you distinguish between market making and speculating? Some of the proposed metrics for making these fine ex-post distinctions may end up discouraging market making.  

The UK Vickers Report: The UK took a slightly different approach on structural reforms in [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md); that is, on the separation of risky activities from standard [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) activities. The so-called Vickers Report (Independent Commission on [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md), 2011) aims at separating retail [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) services that are crucial for the smooth operation of the real economy from global wholesale and [investment banking](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209-%20Corporate%20Securities%20And%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) operations. Banks are required to ring-fence their retail [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) operations. More specifically, banks are required to move retail [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) operations under a special subsidiary that is separated from the rest of the bank in a legal, economic, and operational sense. The retail subsidiary should comply with all minimum regulatory requirements (including requirements on capital, [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md), funding, and large exposures). Its ties with the rest of the [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) group should be limited. It should have an independent corporate governance structure with a majority of independent directors and report in the same way as an independent listed company.  

The activities that need to be ring-fenced include deposit taking and provision of overdrafts to individuals and to small and medium enterprises. The prohibited activities in the ring-fence include trading related activities, underwriting of security issues, market making, activities on a secondary markets, [derivatives](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) trading (for the purpose other than [hedging](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)), and the provisioning of nonpayment-related services to clients outside the European Economic Area or to financial customers.  

The permitted activities, subject to certain limits on wholesale funding, include secured and unsecured lending to individuals and corporations (e.g., mortgages, credit cards), deposit taking and lending to large nonfinancial corporations, trade finance, and selling products from the nonring-fenced parts of a bank that bring no exposure to the ring-fenced part.  

The EU Liikanen Report: Following the regulatory overhaul in the United States and the United Kingdom through the enactment of the Dodd–Frank Act and the work of the Independent Commission on [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md), the European Commission installed a commission to evaluate the regulatory framework in [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) and suggest improvements, with a particular focus on structural measures.  

The report, called the Liikanen Report (Liikanen et al. (2012)), proposes that a bank that has substantial trading activities should move these activities to a separate legal entity (a so-called “trading entity”), walled off from deposit-taking and retail-payment operations. Separation is intended to ensure that trading activities are no longer either the explicit or implicit recipients of government safety nets that protect standard [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) operations. The activities required to be moved into the trading entity are proprietary trading, assets, or derivative positions that arise due to market-making activities, lending to [hedge funds](../../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) and SIVs, and [private equity](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2014%20-%20Private%20Equity,%20Pension,%20and%20Sovereign%20Funds/Private%20Equity.md) investments.  

Compared to Vickers, the approach employed in the Liikanen Report is to build a wall around the trading activities and not around the retail operations. The basic idea, however, is the same: trading should not benefit from government safety nets nor should it put the bank’s retail operation at risk. Also, in both cases, all activities (albeit separated) can be continued under one roof, consistent with the universal [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) model, common in Europe.  

How to evaluate? The big question is whether the structural remedies as proposed by either the Volcker Rule, Vickers Report, and the Liikanen Report are effective. This is not obvious. Recall that market forces effectively undermined the Glass–Steagall Act. Why will the new structural approaches not suffer the same fate? This is one unanswered question. Another is whether driving out (Volckers) or separating financial market activities (Vickers, Liikanen) will make the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md) more stable. Can we afford widespread failures of those activities across the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md)?51 For example, if a bank’s trading unit fails, what is the consequence of the reputational spillovers on the rest of the bank? What would be the implications for the real economy? Recall that Lehman Brothers was an [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) bank, and yet its failure is considered by some as one of the events of the 2007–2009 crisis that deepened the crisis. Note also that retail operations can be risky (Northern Rock). So the effectiveness of the proposed measures remains an untested hypothesis. Moreover, we do not have a good sense of the costs of the measures.  

# STABILITY: MACROPRUDENTIAL REGULATION  

Before the 2007–2009 [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md), the focus of bank regulation was on microprudential regulation, in which, the main goal of a bank regulator is to prevent the failure of an individual bank. Now macroprudential regulation occupies much greater regulatory focus. In macroprudential regulation, the main goal is to guarantee stability of the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md) at large. The regulator focuses on the risk that the system fails, meaning typically that many [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) fail simultaneously, or are simultaneously in distress. This is called systemic risk. As pointed out in Chapter 14  a [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md), in which the whole [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md) is distressed, typically follows euphoric periods of [asset price](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) booms fueled by excessive lending by highly levered [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md). Macroprudential regulation would seek to dampen these boom–burst cycles. As Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen (2014) noted:  

“I believe a macroprudential approach to supervision and regulation needs to play the primary role. Such an approach should focus on “through the cycle” standards that increase the resilience of the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md) to adverse shocks and on efforts to ensure that the regulatory umbrella will cover previously uncovered systemically important institutions and activities. These efforts should be complemented by the use of countercyclical macroprudential tools…”  

Macroprudential regulation seeks to minimize episodes of fire-sale prices in [asset markets](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) due to selling of assets by distressed [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md), the consequently adverse effects of these fire-sale prices on the capital positions of these institutions, and then the reduced lending by these institutions that causes a credit crunch. Whatever the initial adverse economic shock that caused [asset price](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) declines and led to fire sales of assets by [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md), a credit crunch exacerbates the initial economic shock by causing a shrinkage in the economic activity of firms that are left without financing. This drags the real economy further down, accentuating the economic doldrums and resulting in greater procyclicality. The goal of macroprudential policies is to strengthen resilience of the [banking system](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Class%20Slide%203%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) during times of economic growth so that banks are better prepared for times of economic downturn.52  

One of the criticisms of the Basel II Capital Accord is that risk-based minimum capital requirements would increase procyclicality in [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md). In particular, banks that estimate risks to be low during periods of economic growth are easily able to satisfy minimum capital requirements with relatively low capital levels, and may even have “excess” capital. This encourages additional lending and further fuels economic growth. In recessions, banks perceiving higher risks need to build up higher capital cushions to meet risk-based capital requirements. Since it is difficult to raise additional capital during a recession, banks cut back on lending, which then exacerbates the recession.  

Within the context of the Basel II Capital Accord, there is some scope to limit procyclicality: that is, if the metrics to estimate risks include sufficiently long time periods that cover recessions. If so, the estimated risks would not vary substantially across economic cycles and consequently would not add cyclicality to the minimum capital requirements. In addition, bank supervisors can work to lower procyclicality through the Pillar II supervisory process. For example, the supervisors can demand higher risk estimates and capital levels during economic booms.  

The Basel III Capital Accord introduces several additional measures to reduce procyclicality in [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) (BCBS, 2011). A capital conservation buffer is additional capital formed in the period of normal operations of a bank that can be drawn down in times of stress. The Basel III Capital Accord prescribes a capital conservation buffer of $2.5\%$ of Common equity Tier-1 capital over risk-weighted assets. Common equity Tier-1 capital can only be used as a capital conservation buffer if minimum capital requirements are already satisfied (including the minimum $4.5\%$ Common equity Tier-1 capital, $6\%$ Tier 1, and $8\%$ Total capital requirements).  

If the capital conservation buffer is depleted, the bank needs to restore it by limiting the redistribution of profits to its shareholders, other capital providers, and employees (e.g., by limiting [dividend payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md), share buybacks, and discretionary bonus payments to employees). The constraints on redistribution increase with the extent to which the capital conservation buffer is depleted.  

The Basel III Capital Accord also prescribes the formation of a countercyclical buffer  A countercyclical buffer will be implemented on a national basis if excess credit growth in a country indicates that systemic risk is piling up in the [banking system](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Class%20Slide%203%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md). More specifically, a national bank supervisor could impose a countercyclical buffer requirement between $0\%$ and $2.5\%$ of risk weighted assets.  

Forward-looking provisioning is another tool to lower procyclicality in [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md). Forward-looking provisioning refers to the accounting practices for loan-loss provisioning that are based on the “expected loss” approach rather than on the current “incurred-loss” approach. The incurred-loss model requires for banks to make provisions (for loan losses) only after a loss event occurs. However, this has granted banks substantial leeway in delaying the recognition of losses during the 2007–2009 [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md), something that the expected-loss approach seeks to avoid.53  

In response, the [International Accounting](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%209/Week%209-Information%20Risks%20and%20(International)%20Accounting%20Differences,%20Platform%20Businesses.md) Standards Board (IASB) published a new Standard IFRS 9, which prescribes the application of an expected-credit-loss model that encompasses all [financial instruments](../../Financial%20Instruments/A%20Practical%20Guide%20for%20Actuaries%20and%20other%20Business%20Professionals..md) subject to impairment accounting. Under IFRS 9, provisions need to be based on expected credit losses. In addition, full lifetime expected credit losses need to be recognized when the [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) of a financial instrument falls substantially (IASB (2014)). The IASB, however, has not reached a unified view with the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB); the FASB is has made only limited changes to the US GAAP intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instrument (see FASB, 2016).  

Higher loss absorbency requirement: Rather than focus on the time dimension of systemic risk that is reflected in procyclicality, the regulators could also aim to contain the cross-sectional dimension of systemic risk. In particular, risks can be concentrated in the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md) in the way that they threaten the stability of the whole [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md). For example, the risks concentrated in a bank that is too-big-to-fail may lead to a systemic [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) crisis. In this light, the Basel Committee on [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Supervision54 proposes additional capital requirements for globally systemically important banks (GSIBs). The so-called higher loss absorbency requirement needs to be in a form of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and [ranges](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Exotic%20Interest%20Rate%20Options.md) from $1\%$ to $3.5\%$ of risk-weighted assets, depending on the global systemic importance of a bank. The global systemic importance of a bank reflects the loss that a bank’s failure imposes on the global [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md). It is measured by several indicators, including the size, interconnectedness and complexity of a bank, how globally the bank operates and how substitutable its services are.  

[Leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) ratio: and [Liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) Regulation:55 Both these were discussed earlier.  

Other measures: Various other instruments may help limit systemic risk. An important one that is being proposed in the EU are time-varying loan-to-value ratio requirements. Central banks could be given the right to impose higher loanto-value requirements on banks when they suspect high asset prices could be forming bubbles that could burst suddenly. This can force borrowers to rely more on internal funds and arrest ruinous [asset price](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) increases in markets like real estate, where subsequent price drops bring with them financial crises. Another item that is much on the agenda of particularly EU policymakers is executive compensation. Measures have been introduced to limit variable pay and facilitate “clawbacks,” whereby a bonus given to a bank executive for high earnings during good times can be “clawed back” during bad times. The idea is to limit the compensation benefits executives can get from risk taking and the high profit variability that comes with it.  

# Empirical Evidence on capital structure and liability structure through time  

Ultimately, the effectiveness of capital requirements in elevating capital levels should be assessed empirically. In this respect, the Basel I and Basel II Capital Accords, along with the FDICIA of 1991, cannot be considered an unqualified success, whereas it is too early to judge the Basel III Capital Accord. While on smaller [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) the picture is mixed, the average capital ratios among the largest U.S. [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) (i.e., BHCs) declined significantly before the 2007–2009 [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md). The decline was the most pronounced for large BHCs, see Figures 15.5, 15.6, and also the evidence reported in Chapter 2.  

In addition to declining capital ratios, it is also apparent that banks have exploited the rather broad regulatory definitions of capital and assets to reduce the level of equity capital even below what their regulatory capital ratios might suggest. That is, the flexibility afforded by risk-based capital requirements in the Basel framework has been used to reduce the amount of equity. See Figure 15.7 to see how much lower European banks’ common equity/total assets ratios have been than their (regulatory) ratios of tier-1 capital to risk-weighted assets.  

Moreover, insufficient bank capital led to a substantial number of banks failing in the United States during the 2007–2009 [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) (see Figure 15.8). The magnitude of the losses due to failures during the 2007–2009 [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) eclipsed the magnitudes of losses during the previous episodes of [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) crises as Figure 15.9 shows.

# MARKET STRUCTURE, CONSUMER PROTECTION, CREDIT ALLOCATION,AND MONETARY CONTROL REGULATION  

# Market Structure and Competition  

As in other markets, competition among banks can be good for its customers – borrowers who might obtain cheaper financing and depositors who are paid higher [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md). But excessive competition among banks can encourage excessive risk taking by banks, as we discuss below.  

On the one hand, competition facilitates the efficient allocation of resources in the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md). Competitive pressures force banks to improve efficiency, and these efficiency gains are shared with the bank’s customers.  

On the other hand, competition may also lead to instability in the [banking system](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Class%20Slide%203%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) as banks take excessive risks by pursuing riskier borrowers and investments because profit margins in traditional businesses are squeezed by competition. Bank regulation may thus seek to limit competition by elevating barriers to entry, branching restrictions, BHC limitations, and merger controls. You will recall from Chapter 12 that safety might be enhanced by improving the charter values of existing banks and thrifts. Charter values of existing banks can be enhanced by limiting entry of new banks  so as to increase the economic rents earned by incumbents. Technological advances may have lowered entry barriers in recent years. Also, prior to the 2007–2009 [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) public policy might also have favored increasing competition. Recent regulatory initiatives point at a renewed emphasis on increasing entry barriers. We now turn to the ways in which [market structure](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Market%20Structure%20and%20Size.md) and competition regulation can affect industry structure.  

Bank Chartering in the United States: Chartering policy is designed to influence industry structure and also to foster adequate capitalization as well as ethical and competent management. Prior to the FDIC, entry controls were shared by the OCC and the state [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) agencies and consequently varied widely. The advent of the FDIC added a measure of uniformity to the standards for chartering banks and thrifts. The FDIC, [the Fed](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md), and the OCC collaborated to implement a restrictive chartering policy until the mid-1960s. For example, only 70 new banks were chartered between 1936 and 1955. Subsequently, chartering requirements have become more transparent: to obtain a bank charter, one must submit a welldesigned operating plan along with adequate capital and credible management.  

Branching and BHC Restrictions in the United States: The United States had over 11,000 banks in 1993, more than any other nation. The main reason for this proliferation of banks was a highly restrictive branching policy that existed until the Riegel–Neal Interstate [Banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 permitted interstate [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md). Both national- and state-chartered banks were limited in their geographic expansion by laws of their domicile states. This is the heritage of the McFadden Act of 1927. Pursuant to the U.S. Treasury’s proposal of February 1991, legislation was drafted to permit adequately capitalized banks to branch without regard to state boundaries, but the bill failed. To be sure, along with multistate pacts, many failed institutions provided opportunities for interstate expansion.56 Thus, even prior to the Riegel–Neal Act, Citicorp claimed to do business in 30 states and Norwest (now Wells Fargo) in all 50 states through a patchwork of failed thrifts and banks they had purchased, along with mortgage [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) and consumer finance companies. Others like Bank of America also built formidable interstate organization, but the pattern was checkered.  

Before the BHC Act of 1956, holding companies were permitted in a number of upper Midwest, West Coast, and Southern states and became an instrument for circumventing restrictions on branch [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md). Thus, if a bank desired to expand in a state that severely restricted branching, it could establish a holding company that could, in turn, purchase separately incorporated banks within the state. Such a structure permitted the exploitation of economies of scale in marketing, finance, and processing, but each bank also needed to sustain the cost of being a separate corporate entity. Reserve requirements and capital requirements needed to be maintained separately, and each bank needed a separate board of directors. Clearly, the multiBHC could not achieve all the potential savings of a branch structure.  

The passage of the Reigel–Neal Act in 1994 finally permitted banks to branch across state lines. However, given the overcapacity in bank branches at that time, the way that banks expanded subsequently across state lines was by acquiring banks in various states rather than opening new branches. An important consequence of this consolidation was a dramatic decline in the number of U.S. banks, which was further fueled by the [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) and stood at 5876 by the end of 2013. Note that the number of branches quickly increased until 2008, then stayed at similar levels until 2012, and then began to decline. (See Figure 15.10 )  

Merging with another bank is an alternative method of branching, but the BHC Act of 1956, its 1970 amendment, and the Bank Merger Act of 1960 require [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) authorities to review all proposed mergers, after obtaining the opinion of the

Department of Justice regarding the anticompetitive effects. A 1966 amendment to the Bank Merger Act shifted more of the responsibility to the Department of Justice where anticompetitive considerations were elevated. Although guidelines were revised again in 1982, the basic idea is to determine whether a bank merger would significantly reduce competition.57  

Competition policy in the EU during the [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md): Competition policy is generally based on three pillars: anti-cartel policy, merger policy, and state-aid control. Anti-cartel policy in the EU resides mainly on Article 101(1) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) that prohibits “all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the internal market…” It is explicitly prohibited to fix prices or other trading conditions, to restrict production, markets, technical development or [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), to share markets or sources of supply, to put other trading parties at a disadvantage and to demand that contracts are subjected to other nonrelated obligations.58  

The European Commission as a competition authority fiercely combats cartels in [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md). For example, the European Commission imposed fines in total of $\notin1.7$ billion to eight international banks for their collusion in the [financial derivatives](../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md) market. The banks manipulated LIBOR and [EURIBOR](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/EURIBOR%20Forward%20Rate%20Agreements%20and%20Futures.md) [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) to earn [trading profits](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%201%20Introduction%20to%20Securities%20Trading%20and%20Markets.md) on [financial derivatives](../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md) that are priced based on these [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).59  

Merger control in the EU is mainly defined by the EC merger regulation (ECMR) and the implementing regulation (IR). Article 2(2) of the ECMR states that “[a] concentration which would not significantly impede effective competition, in the common market or in a substantial part of it, in particular as a result of the creation or strengthening of a dominant position, shall be declared compatible with the common market.” The European Commission evaluates mergers with a community dimension (i.e., mergers that have an impact on a substantial number of EU countries). National competition authorities evaluate other mergers within EU member states.60  

Financial support for their banks by national governments in the EU is also prohibited because it may hinder crossborder competition and the operation of the common internal market. Another reason for prohibition is that such support creates unfair competition (through e.g., too-big-to-fail guarantees) in which inefficient banks may unduly benefit at the expense of more efficient competitors, resulting in a loss of welfare for consumers. Moreover, government protection may also increase risk-taking by banks.

During the 2007–2009 [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md), government intervention was viewed as unavoidable in order to prevent a complete meltdown. Governments largely supported banks and provided guarantees, additional [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md), capital and transferred assets of failing banks in order to safeguard stability. They supported banks collectively and individually (see Figure 15.11), as restoring stability was the overarching objective.  

The European Commission permitted government assistance during the 2007–2009 crisis by invoking an exception in the state-aid control procedures arguing that state aid was needed to “remedy serious disturbances in the economy of a Member State.” The European Commission issued several communications to provide legal certainty and to give guidance regarding the rules of state aid. However, the stipulation was that state aid needed to be accompanied by additional remedies and restrictions for the recipient. The additional remedies and restrictions would be particularly high if the state aid was directed to an individual bank rather than all banks in the system or if state aid was given to insolvent banks rather than to illiquid banks.  

In a different regulatory development the EU dictated that consumers can request the release of their payment and credit history information to third parties. This so called PSD2 legislation is designed to make it easier for consumers to switch between [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md).  

# Consumer Protection Regulation  

Consumer protection regulation in the United States takes many forms. For example, usury laws restrict [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) that lenders can charge on consumer loans. The idea of protecting borrowers from exploitative loan [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) has biblical origins. In the United States, legislation goes back to 1641 when Massachusetts passed a usury law. From an economic standpoint, usury ceilings do not make much sense unless the lender is a monopolist. When a bank encounters a borrower whose assessed risk warrants a loan interest rate higher than the usury ceiling, the bank will withhold credit.61  

Another form of fairness regulation mandates the disclosure of information by lenders. The Truth-in-Lending Act   
(Federal Reserve Regulation Z) requires that lenders provide their customers with standardized credit information regard  
ing finance charges and annual percentage rates in order to permit more informed borrower decisions. Similarly, the   
Real Estate [Settlement Procedures](../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%205%20-%20Index%20Futures.md) Act (RESPA) requires that mortgage borrowers be provided all relevant information   
about the real estate settlement process, and a uniform settlement statement that discloses all fees and charges at closing. The 2007–09 [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) has caused regulators to focus on questionable business practices of banks in their   
quest for higher profits, particularly those related to mortgages. Consequently, new legislation within the Dodd–Frank  

Act – Title XIV: Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act – was adopted, amending the Truth-in-Lending Act. The Mortage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act aims at limiting lending practices that: (1) granted loans to borrowers who were not creditworthy and (2) targeted lending to financially unsophisticated borrowers who did not understand the terms of the credit they were getting. As indicated earlier, the Dodd–Frank Act (under Title X) also establishes the CFPB.  

In addition to protecting borrowers, legislation seeks to protect depositors. The Truth in Savings Act (TIS) was enacted in 1991 as part of the Comprehensive [Deposit Insurance Reform](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Options%20For%20Deposit%20Insurance%20Reform.md) and Taxpayer Protection Act  The purpose of TIS, which went into effect June 1993, is to promote competition among depository decisions. TIS requires uniform disclosure of the terms and conditions for the payment of interest and the charging of deposit fees. It applies to all banks and thrifts, insured and uninsured. Credit unions are not directly subject to TIS, but the National Credit Union Association (NCUA) – the regulatory agency governing credit unions – adopted similar rules.  

Given the rapid growth in electronic funds transfer (EFT), it is not surprising that regulation governs this activity as well. The Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) of 1978 is designed to protect consumers by establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of EFT participants. The EFTA focuses on the types of transactions rather than the type of institution providing the service. It applies to most fund transfers initiated through an electronic terminal, telephone, computer or magnetic tape to authorize the debiting or crediting of an account by a financial institution (e.g., automate teller machine transfers, telephone payment, point-of-sale terminal transfers). Thus, payment by check, for example, would not be covered by the EFTA.  

The EFTA is a complex web of requirements, one of which is that the consumer be provided “means of access” (e.g., a card and a personal identification number) that can be used to initiate an EFT transaction. Other requirements have to do with disclosure and documentation. Prior to a consumer’s first EFT transaction, the financial institution must provide a written disclosure statement that clearly explains the terms and conditions under which the EFT service is provided. Moreover, for each transaction initiated at an electronic terminal, the financial institution must provide a written receipt that clearly states the relevant information about the transaction.  

In a major recent initiative, the EU has implemented strict data protection laws, the so-called GDPR legislation.  

# Credit Allocation Regulation  

Because bank credit availability affects the pattern of economic activity, governments are often tempted to influence the allocation of this credit to achieve social and political objectives. Some form of governmental credit allocation is found in almost every country. Atypically, overt governmental credit allocation has been used only sparingly in the United States, except during times of war or national emergencies. However, numerous indirect credit allocation mechanisms have been extensively employed in the United States. We discuss some of these below.  

Credit for the Purchase of Securities: Credit to finance securities has been regulated by the Federal Reserve since 1934. Initial credit is limited to a percentage of the value of the security. If the value of the security drops after credit is extended, a borrower is subject to a margin call. The borrower must then provide additional collateral or sell stock. Moreover, the Federal Reserve may limit a member bank’s total lending in support of securities transactions. The obvious effect of this restriction and the [margin requirements](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Case%20Study%20Mf%20Globals%20Repo-To-Maturity%20Trades.md) is to limit credit for the purchase of securities.   
Tax Policy and Guarantee Programs: Tax credits and tax deductions have been used to influence a variety of economic activities, including credit allocation. For example, tax credits are used to encourage capital [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and greater energy efficiency in homes. Tax deductibility of charitable contributions has increased the flow of capital to eligible organizations.   
Credit Programs for Specific Sectors of the Economy: The government has a long history of credit programs to promote specific sectors of economy. Examples are housing, education, and agriculture.  

For example, the thrift industry was nurtured by the government primarily to encourage home ownership. The [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) portfolios of these institutions were restricted and tax incentives were provided to encourage investments in residential mortgages. A major objective of Regulation Q was to keep funding costs low so that home buyers could obtain low-cost credit. Fannie Mae (FNMA), Ginnie Mae (GNMA), and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were created and subsidized to provide a [secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) for mortgage loans in order to further encourage the flow of credit into housing. The government’s role in directing credit to housing has been massive.  

In 1970, the federal government began directing credit to education with the adoption of the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. Loans were made available to students at favorable [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and liberal repayment terms. Sallie Mae (Student Loan Marketing association) was created to provide a [secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) for student loans.  

The federal government also subsidizes agriculture. The Farm Credit System (FCS) gives farmers subsidized loans, and the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) makes low-interest loans to rural cooperatives, and guarantees loans for rural telephone and cable television. In 1988, Congress created Farmer Mac (Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation) to provide a [secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) for farm mortgages and rural housing loans.62  

Following the [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) strong pressure came into existence to reform the various federal agencies, including Fannie Mae and Fredie Mac. They were seen as culprits in facilitating the massive overselling of mortgages. So far reform has been limited, but is subject of discussion.63 Influencing Credit Allocation Through Consumer Protection Regulation: Regulation also seeks to ensure that there is no pernicious discrimination by lenders in the allocation of credit. One such regulation is the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), which is implemented by Regulation B of the Federal Reserve. The ECOA prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, religion, national origin, marital status, age, and gender.64 The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) of 1975 (Regulation C) and the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (Regulation BB) seek similar ends; see the box below. Regulation C prohibits “redlining”, the practice of withholding credit from particular neighborhoods. Regulation BB encourages [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) to serve all legitimate credit needs of their communities.  

# Community Reinvestment Act, 1977  

The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requires banks to make loans in their own community, even if business judgment calls for deploying the bank’s resources elsewhere. Moreover, well before the adoption of the CRA, mechanisms – such as the federal funds market and the Treasury bills market – were already in place to channel funds from deficit to surplus areas. The logic of the CRA is that banks are chartered by the government with privileges and subsidies, and there is a reciprocal obligation to serve the local community where the bank obtains its financial resources (deposits). But as brokers, banks exist to redeploy funds from surplus to deficit users (locales), motivated by spatial differences in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md). For example, for decades funds raised via bank deposits on the East Coast found their way to the West Coast because of differences in rates of economic growth and [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) opportunities. This welfare-improving transportation of financial resources could violate CRA, depending on how it is applied. The CRA can counterproductively distort credit flows, and this is the source of much of the controversy surrounding this legislation.  

Previously, banks with under $\$250$ million in assets (considered “small banks”) were mostly tested on whether they were making loans to the entire community. Banks with assets exceeding $\$250$ million (considered “large banks”) were tested for lending practices, but were also required to earn $25\%$ of their grade in service and $25\%$ in community reinvestment. Changes in the CRA rules in 2004 released almost 1800 banks with assets between $\$250$ million and $\$1$ billion from CRA’s data collection requirement as well as community [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and service tests. The new community development test covers four areas of activity: affordable housing, community services, economic development, and revitalization of stabilization activities.  

“Redlining” or rejecting credit applicants because of their gender, race, religion, and other attributes is divisive.65 Moreover, it is wrong to state the cost of a loan or other financial service in terms that intentionally confuse or mislead the client. But it should also be understood that [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) is about making the most efficient credit decisions possible on the basis of incomplete information, and gender, race, age, handicap, and neighborhood of origin are correlates of creditworthiness, but these attributes are more costly to observe. Thus, the banker need not be a bigot to discriminate. Nor should he or she necessarily be expected to internalize the social costs of using freely available information. But this is the rationale for equal opportunity credit legislation, proponents of which argue that the banker has been privileged to operate with a valuable license, and an obligation attaches to the privilege.  

Title XII of the [Dodd-Frank Act](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Credit%20Derivative%20Indexes.md), entitled Improving Access to Mainstream [Financial Institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md), aims at providing low-income and medium-income individuals access to [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) for mainstream financial products and services. Title XII supports opening an account at a federal insured bank, provision of microloans, financial education and counseling. The aim of Title XII is that low- and medium-income individuals rely on common financial products rather than predatory lending products such as pay-day loans and cash advances.  

# Monetary Control Regulation  

The two major forms of bank regulation relating to monetary control objectives are: reserve requirements and the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md). Moreover, “moral suasion” by the central bank also plays a role. In addition, several unconventional [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) tools were used to tackle disturbances on [financial markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) due to the [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md). We discuss each in turn.  

(1) Legal Reserve Requirements: Cash-asset reserve requirements mandate that the bank retain a certain fraction of its deposits liabilities in a noninterest bearing, liquid form – vault cash or deposits, at the Federal Reserve in the case of Fed member banks, or deposits at member banks in the case of nonmember banks. All depository institutions in the United Stats are subject to reserve requirements on customer deposits.  

Reserve requirements also vary depending on the type of the deposit. For instance, reserve requirements against time deposits (CDs) are zero, whereas deposits subject to withdrawal on demand, or net transactions accounts, are subject to a reserve requirement that depends on the level of deposits. No reserves are required for the first $\$16$ million in deposits. Between $\$16$ million and $\$122.30$ million, there is a $3\%$ reserve requirement, and above $\$122.30$ million there is a $10\%$ reserve requirement.66 Reserves are computed as the average held over a 14-day period.  

The earliest justification for reserve requirements was as a source of [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md).67 This notion was derived from the role that specie reserves played as a source of [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) to redeem notes. However, required reserves are unavailable to meet deposit withdrawals. The reason is that any deposit withdrawal reduces available reserves, and the deficit must be made up. For example, consider a bank with $\$100$ in deposits and a $5\%$ reserve requirement against these deposits. Imagine that the bank has $\$10$ in capital, so that the total asset base is $\$110$ . This bank is required to keep $\$5$ in cash reserves. Imagine that it does so and invests the remaining $\$105$ in other assets. Now, suppose there is a $\$5$ deposit withdrawal that the bank meets with its reserves. Since it now has $\$95$ in deposits, it needs to keep $\$4.75$ in reserves. This will require taking in new deposits (note, however, that more than $\$4.75$ in new deposits will be needed since the reserve requirement applies also to the new deposits)68 or by liquidating other assets.69  

This is the paradox of fractional reserve requirements. Rather than augmenting [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md), reserve requirements freeze assets into immobility.70 The safety of any fractional reserve [banking system](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Class%20Slide%203%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) rests squarely on the availability of a secure and reliable [lender of last resort](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/The%20Only%20Game%20in%20Town%20Walter%20Bagehot.md). Fractional reserve requirements cannot help much in this regard.  

More recently, reserve requirements have been rationalized as a tool of [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md).71 In its 1931 report, [the Fed](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) Committee on Bank Reserves stated: “The most important function served by reserve requirements is the control of credit.” Since increasing reserve requirements means that a smaller fraction of deposits can be loaned out by the bank, the Federal Reserve can, in principle, affect the availability of credit by altering reserve requirements.  

As a practical matter, however, reserve requirements have played only a minor role in [the Fed](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md)’s [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md). From the early years of the [Federal Reserve System](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Fed%20Fund%20Futures.md) through the 1920s, the primary instrument of credit policy was the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md),72 and from 1942 until the Treasury-Fed Accord in 1951, reserve requirements remained virtually unchanged because [the Fed](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) committed itself to a policy of supporting government bond prices.  

The current officially stated rationale for reserve requirements is that they are a tool of [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md). This position was first articulated in the 1950s, when [the Fed](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) came to view reserve requirements as a mechanism for limiting the growth of the money stock as well as credit. It is now believed, however, that this is a specious argument. Without reserve requirements, banks can be expected to voluntarily hold some cash assets, the amount depending on how the LLR facility is priced and administered, and deposit expansion and contraction would ensue more or less as it would with legal reserve requirements. Moreover, reserve requirements have numerous drawbacks: They foster spurious innovation as depository institutions create deposit substitutes to avoid reserve requirements (since there is invariably a lag before regulators respond by imposing reserve requirements on the new liabilities).73  

The critical feature of reserve requirements is that they determine the sharing of seigniorage on bank deposits between the central bank and the privately owned banks. The higher the reserve requirement, the greater the share of seigniorage that flows to the Federal Reserve, and ultimately back to the U.S. Treasury. Lower reserve requirements direct these monopoly profits to the privately owned banks. This is why reserve requirements are sometimes referred to as a tax on the banks, but they could be defensibly described as a subsidy, depending on who owns the rightful claim to the deposit seigniorage.  

Some have argued that the Federal Reserve continues to support reserve requirements because they produce three bureaucratic benefits.74 First, reserve requirements permit the remission of substantial sums to the Treasury, thereby fostering [the Fed](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md)’s continued budgetary independence; currently, the Federal Reserve’s earnings, after expenses and a small contingency reserve charge, are paid to the Treasury as a special franchise tax.75 Second, reserve requirements provide the Federal Reserve with a natural constituency since [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) subject to reserve requirements can be influenced by [the Fed](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md).76 Finally, in the past, when reserve requirements applied only to Federal Reserve member banks, they enabled the Federal Reserve to expand its operations because a variety of subsidized services had to be provided to induce members not to leave the system.77  

The thing to remember about reserve requirements is that their most basic rationale is to address the [moral hazard](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) associated with the LLR facility, and the real issue is the sharing of deposit seigniorage between the government and the privately owned banks.  

(2) The [Discount Window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md): The [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) is a mechanism by which the Federal Reserve performs its LLR responsibilities. Banks are allowed to borrow through the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) to meet short-term [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) needs. Prior to the passage of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 (DIDMCA), the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) was available only to member banks. DIDMCA expanded access to the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) for nonmember banks and S&Ls, mutual savings banks, and credit unions as well. This was “fair” since DIDMCA also extended federal cash-asset reserve requirements to all institutions.  

When a depository institution borrows through the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md), it ordinarily uses government securities as collateral. This borrowing is used to make up reserves lost due to (unanticipated) deposit withdrawals. Thus, the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) is closely linked to reserve requirements.  

Establishment of the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) was one of the primary reasons for the creation of [the Fed](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md). In addition to providing [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md), the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) also facilitates the conduct of [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) in that contractionary open market operations can drain the [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) of individual institutions. The box below provides further details on the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md).  

# Discount window details  

Brief History: [The Fed](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) has three major instruments of [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md): open market operations, changes in reserve requirements, and changes in the terms of borrowing from the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md). Reserve requirement changes have never been used on a consistent basis as a [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) tool. One argument is that they represent a very cumbersome policy instrument, although this is largely a [calibration](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%204.md) issue. That is, reserve requirements can be changed from $10\%$ to $10.0001\%$ rather than to $10.5\%,$ and then they would not be so cumbersome. Nonetheless, the “cumbersome” argument has often been cited as an impediment to using reserve requirements. And, at least in the early years of [the Fed](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md), open market operations were not used much either. Administration of the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) was the key tool for regulating bank reserves.  

Since one of the stated purposes of the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) was to encourage bank safety, access to the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) was considered a privilege rather than an entitlement. At the time that [the Fed](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) was created, safety and [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) were to be promoted by encouraging banks to make short-term, self-liquidating loans backed by real goods (“real bills”). In the early years of [the Fed](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md), banks could borrow from the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) only by discounting eligible commercial paper (“real bills”). Banks engaged in risky investments could be denied [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) access by [the Fed](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md).  

The [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) reforms following the [Great Depression](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%201928-1937.md) resulted in the adoption of the principle that banks should be allowed greater access to the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md). The “real bills doctrine” was discarded, and banks were allowed to borrow at the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) using any collateral acceptable to the district Reserve Bank. Thus, in the period immediately following the [Great Depression](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%201928-1937.md), the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) was used primarily as a means for [the Fed](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) to stand ready to act as a lender of last  

resort and ensure the overall [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) of the [banking system](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Class%20Slide%203%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) rather than as an instrument of [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) or as a way to influence banks to specialize in real bills.78 In more recent times, the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md), in conjunction with federal open mar  
ket operations, has become an important [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) tool. For example, when the Federal Reserve wants to stimulate the economy with a monetary expansion, it may lower the borrowing rate at the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md). This usually has a ripple effect   
in the economy, lowering a host of other [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and facilitating increased borrowing for [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and consumption.   
The [Discount Rate](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/PSET%207-%20Kohler.md): The rate at which a depository institution can borrow at the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) is known as the discount   
rate. This rate is set at each district Federal Reserve Bank by the board of directors and is subject to approval by the Board o   
Governors of the [Federal Reserve System](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Fed%20Fund%20Futures.md). The costs of borrowing at the [discount window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) are twofold for a depository institution. One is the [discount rate](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/PSET%207-%20Kohler.md), and the   
other is the cost of the accompanying  ncreased regulatory surveillance.   
Forms of Borrowing From the [Discount Window](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md): There are three forms of discount credit: primary credit, secondary credit, and seasonal credit.   
Primary and Secondary Credit: Primary credit is typically overnight and available to depository institutions in sound financial   
condition, usually with minimal administrative conditions. Depository institutions not eligible for primary credit can avail of   
secondary credit with higher administrative requirements and further oversight.   
Seasonal Credit: Because some banks, like rural agricultural banks, are subject to predictably large seasonal credit needs and   
lack ready access to [credit markets](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%201.md), the Federal Reserve amended Regulation A in 1973 to provide seasonal credit to banks.   
This credit is limited to institutions with deposits less than a stipulated maximum, the rationale being that larger institutions   
have access to [credit markets](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%201.md). The credit extension period lasts from four weeks to nine months.   
Emergency Credit for Others: Emergency credit is available to individuals and businesses. Such credit is extended only under   
very rare circumstances by the district Federal Reserve Bank, and only after consultation with the Board of Governors. Such credit is ostensibly made available only if the borrower is unable to secure credit elsewhere, and failure to obtain credit could   
have a harmful effect on the economy.   
nterest on Required Balances and Excess Balances: The [Financial Services](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 allowed the Federal   
Reserve Banks to pay [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) on funds at Federal Reserve Banks that are maintained to satisfy reserve balance require  
ments and on excess balances. The interest rate was set to $0.25\%$ in the period from 2009 to 2013.  

(3) Moral Suasion: Central banks around the world also exercise control over banks they regulate by using “moral suasion” or “jawboning.” This is simply exerting pressure on banks by persuading, cajoling, or coercing them to act in a particular way. This mode of policy implementation is less feasible in the United States with its thousands of banks than in Europe or Japan where [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) tends to be more concentrated.  

(4) Unconventional [Monetary Policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) Tools During the 2007–2009 [Global Financial Crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md): The Federal Reserve implemented several unconventional [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) tools to deal with the widespread disturbances on various [financial markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md). For example, the Term [Asset-Backed](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) Securities Loan Facility (TALF) was established as a [funding facility](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Update%20On%20Outstanding%20Lending%20Facilities.md) by the Federal Reserve to provide support for the market of ABS that are collateralized by the loans to consumers and businesses. Under TALF, the Federal Reserve Bank of NewYork supports market participants by lending on a nonrecourse basis to [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) that hold high quality ABS backed by newly issued consumer or small-business loans. Several other facilities are already wound down because conditions on the respective markets have improved.79 See Chapter 14 for more discussion of this.  

# CONCLUSION  

Banks have been regulated for over two centuries in the United States and even longer so in some other countries. Although regulation has been shaped largely by historical events, as opposed to being the outcome of a well-thought-out regulatory agenda, there have been some important goals that have guided [banking regulation](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%206/Week%206%20Bank%20Business%20Model,%20Regulation,%20and%20Accounting%20Rules.md). In this chapter, we have explained these goals and described the major regulations to which banks are subjected. In the next chapter, we discuss important milestones in [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) legislation in the 1990s, and the early twenty first century.
