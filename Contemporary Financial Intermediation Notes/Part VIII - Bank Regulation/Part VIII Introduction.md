# INTRODUCTION  

In the previous chapter, we discussed one aspect of bank regulation, namely, deposit insurance. In this chapter, we discuss bank regulation in a more general context, with attention to the objectives and incentive effects of regulation.  

Public regulation of banking has a long and checkered history, with roots extending back to sovereigns who reserved to themselves the rights of coinage. By impressing their imprimatur on a flat piece of metal, a coin would be struck that would trade at a premium to the metal’s intrinsic value. The premium derived from the monetary services provided by the coin, which in turn was enabled by the coin’s managed scarcity and the authenticity of the coin’s ingredients signaled by the imprimatur. The premium or monopoly profit earned from the coin, called seigniorage, was appropriated by the sovereign, owner of the imprimatur. Seigniorage was one of the more efficient modes of taxation.  

Like coins, bank deposits provide monetary services, and they too are artificially scarce, even if their ingredients are altogether ephemeral. They also generate seigniorage, and this makes banks an obvious target of government regulation. But public regulation has encouraged circumventing adaptations on the part of the banks, which in turn has led to ever more intrusive forms of regulation. This dynamic, sometimes referred to as the regulatory dialectic, has led to more encompassing regulation.  

Numerous rationales for regulation have been advanced including:  

protecting safety and soundness of an individual institution, protecting the stability of the financial system, fostering competition, consumer protection, credit allocation, and  monetary control.
