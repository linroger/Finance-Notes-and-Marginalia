# Basic Concepts

"Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from an academic scribbler of a few years back. I am sure that the power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas."

John Maynard Keynes: The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, 1947

# RISK PREFERENCES

To understand the economic behavior of individuals, it is convenient to think of an individual as being described by a utility function that summarizes preferences over different outcomes. For a wealth level $W$ let $U(W)$ represent the individual's utility of that wealth. It is reasonable to suppose that this individual always prefers more wealth to less. This is called "nonsatiation" and can be expressed as $U^{\prime}(W)>0$, where the prime denotes a mathematical derivative. That is, at the margin, an additional unit of wealth always increases utility by some amount, however small.

<<<<<<< HEAD
An individual can usually be classified as being either [risk neutral](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%207-Exotic%20Options%20And%20Derivative%20Pricing%20By%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation.md), risk averse, or risk preferring. An individual is considered [risk neutral](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%207-Exotic%20Options%20And%20Derivative%20Pricing%20By%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation.md) if the individual is indifferent between the certainty of receiving the mathematical expected value of a gamble and the uncertainty of the gamble itself. Since expected wealth is relevant for the [risk neutral](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%207-Exotic%20Options%20And%20Derivative%20Pricing%20By%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation.md), and the variability of wealth is not, the utility function is linear in wealth, and the second derivative, denoted $U^{\prime\prime}(W)$, will equal zero. Letting $E(\bullet)$ denote the statistical expectation operator, we can write $U[E(W)]=E U(W)$ for a risk-neutral individual, where $U[E(W)]$ is the utility of the expected value of $W$ and $E U(W)$ is the expected utility of $W$. For such an individual, changing the risk of an outcome has no effect on his well-being so long as the expected outcome is left unchanged.

The utility function of a [risk-averse individual](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Risk%20Aversion.md) is concave in wealth, that is, $U^{\prime\prime}(W)<0$. Such an individual prefers a certain amount to a gamble with the same expected value. Jensen's inequality says that

For such an individual, changing the risk of an outcome has no effect on his well-being so long as the expected outcome is left unchanged.

The utility function of a [[Risk Aversion|risk-averse individual]] is concave in wealth, that is, $U^{\prime\prime}(W)<0$. Such an individual prefers a certain amount to a gamble with the same expected value. Jensen's inequality says that
>>>>>>> d83d5c06204d625fbecfdb77e4d3f37c9c80e27b
$$
U[E(W)]>E[U(W)]
$$

if $U$ is (strictly) concave in $W$. Thus, risk-averse individuals prefer less risk to more, or equivalently, they demand a premium for being exposed to risk.

A risk-preferring individual prefers the riskier of two outcomes having the same expected value. The utility function of a risk-preferring individual is convex in wealth, that is, $U^{\prime\prime}(W)>0$. Jensen's inequality says that
$$
U[E(W)]<E[U(W)]
$$

if $U$ is (strictly) convex in $W$.

Despite the popularity of lotteries and parimutuel betting, it is commonly assumed that individuals are risk averse. Most of finance theory is built on this assumption. Figure 1.1 depicts the different kinds of risk preferences.

In Figure 1.2 we have drawn a picture to indicate what is going on. Consider a gamble in which an individual's wealth $W$ can be either $W_{1}$ with probability 0.5 or $W_{2}$ with probability 0.5. If the individual is risk averse, then the individual has a concave utility function that may look like the curve AB. Now, the individual's expected wealth from the gamble is $E(W)=0.5W_{1}+0.5W_{2}$ which is precisely midway between $W_{1}$ and $W_{2}$. The utility derived from this expected wealth is given by $U[E(W)]$ on the $y$-axis. However, if this individual accepts the gamble itself [with an expected value of $E(W)$], then the expected utility, $E U(W)$, is midway between $U(W_{1})$ and $U(W_{2})$ on the $y$-axis, and can be read off the vertical axis as the point of intersection between the vertical line rising from the midpoint between $W_{1}$ and $W_{2}$ on the $x$-axis and the straight line connecting $U(W_{1})$ and $U(W_{2})$. Hence, as is clear from the picture, $U[E(W)]>E U(W)$. The more bowed or concave the individual's utility function, the more risk averse that individual will be and the larger will be the difference between $U[E(W)]$ and $E U(W)$.

We can also ask what sure payment we would have to offer to make this [risk-averse individual](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Risk%20Aversion.md) indifferent between that sure payment and the gamble. Such a sure payment is known as the [certainty equivalent](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Risk%20Aversion.md) of the gamble. In Figure 1.2, this [certainty equivalent](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Risk%20Aversion.md) is denoted by CE on the $x$-axis. Since the individual is risk averse, the [certainty equivalent](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Risk%20Aversion.md) of the gamble is less than the expected value. Alternatively expressed, $E(W)–CE$ is the risk premium that the risk averse individual requires in order to participate in the gamble if his alternative is to receive CE for sure.

The concept of risk aversion is used frequently in this book. For example, we use it in Chapter 3 to discuss the role of [financial intermediaries](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20as%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) in the economy. Risk aversion is also important in understanding financial innovation, [deposit insurance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md), and a host of other issues.

# DIVERSIFICATION

We have just seen that risk-averse individuals prefer to reduce their risk. One way to reduce risk is to diversify. The basic idea behind diversification is that if you hold numerous risky assets, your return will be more predictable, but not necessarily greater. For diversification to work, it is necessary that [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on the assets in your [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) not be perfectly and positively correlated. Indeed, if they are so correlated, the assets are identical for practical purposes so that the opportunity to diversify is defeated. Note that risk can be classified as idiosyncratic or systematic. An idiosyncratic risk is one that stems from forces specific to the asset in question, whereas systematic risk arises from the correlation of the asset's payoff to an economy-wide phenomenon such as depression. Idiosyncratic risks are diversifiable, systematic risks are not.

To see how diversification works, suppose that you hold two assets, A and B, whose [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) are random variables. Let the variances of these [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) be $\sigma_{\mathrm{A}}^{2}$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{B}}^{2}$, respectively. Suppose the [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on A and B are perfectly and positively correlated, so that $\rho_{\mathrm{AB}}=1$, where $\rho_{\mathrm{AB}}$ is the correlation coefficient between A and B. The proportions of the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)'s value invested in A and B are $y_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $y_{\mathrm{B}}$ respectively. Then the variance of the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) return is

We can also ask what sure payment we would have to offer to make this [[Risk Aversion|risk-averse individual]] indifferent between that sure payment and the gamble. Such a sure payment is known as the [[Risk Aversion|certainty equivalent]] of the gamble. In Figure 1.2, this [[Risk Aversion|certainty equivalent]] is denoted by CE on the $x$-axis. Since the individual is risk averse, the [[Risk Aversion|certainty equivalent]] of the gamble is less than the expected value.

# DIVERSIFICATION

We have just seen that risk-averse individuals prefer to reduce their risk. One way to reduce risk is to diversify. The basic idea behind diversification is that if you hold numerous risky assets, your return will be more predictable, but not necessarily greater. For diversification to work, it is necessary that [[Assets|returns]] on the assets in your [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] not be perfectly and positively correlated. Indeed, if they are so correlated, the assets are identical for practical purposes so that the opportunity to diversify is defeated. Note that risk can be classified as idiosyncratic or systematic. An idiosyncratic risk is one that stems from forces specific to the asset in question, whereas systematic risk arises from the correlation of the asset's payoff to an economy-wide phenomenon such as depression. Idiosyncratic risks are diversifiable, systematic risks are not.

To see how diversification works, suppose that you hold two assets, A and B, whose [[Assets|returns]] are random variables. Let the variances of these [[Assets|returns]] be $\sigma_{\mathrm{A}}^{2}$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{B}}^{2}$, respectively. Suppose the [[Assets|returns]] on A and B are perfectly and positively correlated, so that $\rho_{\mathrm{AB}}=1$, where $\rho_{\mathrm{AB}}$ is the correlation coefficient between A and B. The proportions of the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]]'s value invested in A and B are $y_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $y_{\mathrm{B}}$ respectively. Then the variance of the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] return is

$$

Since $\rho_{\mathrm{AB}}=1$, the right-hand side of Equation (1.3) is a perfect square, $(y_{\mathrm{A}}\sigma_{\mathrm{A}}+y_{\mathrm{B}}\sigma_{\mathrm{B}})^2$. As long as $y_{\mathrm{A}}\sigma_{\mathrm{A}}+y_{\mathrm{B}}\sigma_{\mathrm{B}}\geq0$, we can write Equation (1.3) as
$$
\sigma_{\mathrm{P}}=y_{\mathrm{A}}\sigma_{\mathrm{A}}+y_{\mathrm{B}}\sigma_{\mathrm{B}}.
$$

<<<<<<< HEAD
Thus, if $\rho_{\mathrm{AB}}=1$, the standard deviation of the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) return is just the weighted average of the standard deviations of the [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on assets A and B.

To see that diversification helps in this case, suppose $y_{\mathrm{A}}=y_{\mathrm{B}}=0.5$, $\sigma_{\mathrm{A}}^{2}=100$, $\sigma_{\mathrm{B}}^{2}=144$. Calculate the variance of a [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of assets A and B, assuming first that the [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) of the individual assets are perfectly positively correlated, $\rho_{\mathrm{AB}}=1$, and then that they are uncorrelated, $\rho_{\mathrm{AB}}=0$.

# Solution

In the case of perfectly and positively correlated [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md), $\sigma_{\mathrm{P}}=0.5(10)+0.5(12)=11$, or $\sigma_{\mathrm{P}}^{2}=121$. With uncorrelated return, Equation (1.6) implies that $\sigma_{\mathrm{P}}^{2}=0.25(100)+0.25(144)=61$. Thus, not only is this variance lower than with perfectly and positively correlated [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md), but it is also lower than the variance on either of the components assets.

The maximum effect of diversification occurs when $\rho_{\mathrm{AB}}$ is at its minimum value of $-1$, that is, [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) are perfectly negatively correlated.

Even when assets with perfectly negatively correlated [[Assets|returns]] are unavailable, we can reduce [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] risk by adding more assets (provided they are not perfectly positively correlated with those already in the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]]). To illustrate, suppose we have $N$ assets available, each with [[Assets|returns]] pairwise uncorrelated with the [[Assets|returns]] of every other asset. In this case, a generalized version of Equation (1.6) is
>>>>>>> d83d5c06204d625fbecfdb77e4d3f37c9c80e27b
$$
\sigma_{\mathrm{P}}^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}y_{\mathrm{i}}^{2}\sigma_{i}^{2}
$$

<<<<<<< HEAD
where $y_{i}$ is the fraction of the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) value invested in asset $i$ where $i=1,...,N$ and $\sigma_{i}^{2}$ is the variance of asset $i$. Suppose we choose $y_{i}=1/N$.

>>>>>>> d83d5c06204d625fbecfdb77e4d3f37c9c80e27b

Then, defining $\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}^{2}$ as the maximum variance among the $\sigma_{i}^{2}$ (we assume $\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}^{2}<\infty$, and permit $\sigma_{i}^{2}=\sigma^{2}$ for all $i$ in which case $\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}^{2}=\sigma^{2}$), Equation (1.11) becomes
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma_{\mathrm{P}}^{2} &= \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left[\frac{1}{N}\right]^{2}\sigma_{i}^{2} \\
&\leq N\left[\frac{1}{N}\right]^{2}\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}^{2} \\
&= \frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}^{2}}{N}.
\end{aligned}
$$

<<<<<<< HEAD
As $N$ increases, $\sigma_{\mathrm{P}}^{2}$ diminishes, and, in the limit, as $N$ goes to infinity, $\sigma_{\mathrm{P}}^{2}$ goes to zero. Thus, if we have sufficiently many assets with (pairwise) uncorrelated [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md), we can drive the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) risk to as low as we wish and make [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) as predictable as desired.

An obvious question is why investors do not drive their risks to zero. First, not all risks are diversifiable. Some contingencies affect all assets alike and consequently holding more assets will not alter the underlying uncertainty. This is the notion of force majeure in insurance. Natural calamities such as floods and earthquakes are examples, as are losses attributed to wars. Second, as the investor increases the number of securities held in the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), there are obvious costs of administration. These costs restrain diversification, but in addition numerous studies indicate that a large fraction of the potential benefits of diversification is obtained by holding a relatively small number of securities. That is, the marginal benefits of diversification decline rapidly as the number of securities increases.

Finally, cross-sectional reusability of information diminishes the incentive to diversify. We shall have more to say in Chapter 3 about information reusability since this is a major motivation for the emergence of [financial intermediaries](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20as%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md). It suffices to say that if a lender invests in learning about a customer in the steel business in order to make a loan, it will see a potential benefit in lending to others in the steel business. The resulting concentration spreads the costs of becoming informed. Thus, we observe diversification within areas of specialization among most [financial intermediaries](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20as%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md). And when we speak of [financial intermediaries](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20as%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) processing risk, we mean that they are typically diversifying some, absorbing some, and shifting some to others.

[Arbitrage](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) is the simultaneous purchase and sale of identical goods or securities that are trading at disparate prices.

# Solution

<<<<<<< HEAD
Since you can combine $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ to get a payoff that is equivalent to that from B, you can see now that there is an opportunity for [riskless arbitrage](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%208%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Fixed%20Income%20Instruments%20and%20Currencies.md). If you buy one unit each of $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ for a total outlay of $80, you are assured of $100 next period, regardless of whether state H or L is realized. So you can sell two units of B for $86 earning a riskless profit of $6. You are obliged to pay the buyers of these two units of B a total of $100 next period, but this you can do from the cash inflows produced by the securities $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ that you possess. Since you can sell these two units of B before you even buy $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$, your profit requires no investment on your part and no risk. You could of course sell an arbitrarily large number of units of B and buy the appropriate units of $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$, giving yourself a veritable money machine. But as your purchases and sales increase in volume, it is reasonable to expect the prices of the securities to converge, thereby eliminating the opportunity for [riskless arbitrage](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%208%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Fixed%20Income%20Instruments%20and%20Currencies.md) again. An important implication is that the prices of related securities cannot be determined independently of each other. This observation has provided a powerful way to price [derivative securities](../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) such as options.

The notion that any capital market equilibrium should preclude [riskless arbitrage](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%208%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Fixed%20Income%20Instruments%20and%20Currencies.md) has proved to be a powerful concept in many applications in finance, including [financial intermediation](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20as%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md). We will see this idea applied in other contexts, including the valuation of contingent claims such as loan commitments.

# OPTIONS

An option is a contract that gives the owner the right to either buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at some future time or over some fixed time interval. Consider an asset whose value at time $t=1$ will be $X$. Viewed at $t=0$ (the present), $X$ is a random variable. A call option entitles its owner to buy this asset at a fixed price, $P_{\mathrm{c}}$, at or before $t=1$. If he does not wish to buy the asset, he can allow the option to expire unexercised. Thus, the value of the call option at $t=1$ is
$$
C(t=1)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
X-P_{\mathrm{c}} & \text{if } X>P_{\mathrm{c}} \\
0 & \text{if } X \leq P_{\mathrm{c}}.
\end{array}\right.
$$
