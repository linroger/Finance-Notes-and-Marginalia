“Don’t it always seem to go that you don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone?”

# GLOSSARY OF TERMS  

Euro: Common [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) adopted by many member countries of the European Union.  

Yield curve: Relationship between yield to maturity and maturity on [debt instruments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) identical in all respects except maturities (see Chapter 4). [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md): A measure of how long an investor must wait to receive payment on a bond. For bonds that repay only principal (zero coupon bonds), [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) equals maturity. For coupon-paying bonds, [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) is always shorter than maturity.  

[Spot rate](../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md): The current yield to maturity on a bond of a given maturity.  

[Liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) premium: The amount by which the yield on a bond must be grossed up to compensate investors for their inability to convert the bond into cash at a moment’s notice and without loss relative to the bond’s true value.  

Consumer loans: Loans made to individuals and families. These are primarily installment loans.  

Commercial loans: Loans made to corporations. Often referred to as Commercial and Industrial (C&I) loan

Federal funds: Funds in the interbank [loan market](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/Note%20on%20the%20Leveraged%20Loan%20Market.md).

# INTRODUCTION  

This chapter focuses on the variety of services provided by [financial intermediaries](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20as%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) (FIs). Banks are members of an expansive industry that provides a dazzling variety of [financial services](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md). The broader [financial services](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) industry includes institutions as different as commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions, all of which finance their assets with deposits, and government agencies, credit-rating agencies, pension funds, loan sharks, pawnbrokers, lotteries, insurance companies, mutual funds, [hedge funds](../../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md), and private-equity pools. To this list we could add organized exchanges for trading stocks, [futures](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), options, bonds and [commodities](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), parimutuel betting institutions, credit-rating agencies, and the list can be extended almost effortlessly. Broadly speaking, these institutions can be classified into two groups: depository [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) and nondepository [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md). The former include institutions that finance themselves largely with deposits, whereas the latter fund themselves in the capital market. A subset of these nondepository institutions have come to be known as the “shadow [banking system](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Class%20Slide%203%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md).”  

What all these [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) have in common is the processing of risk and its subtle complement, information. FIs produce information for two kinds of applications: (i) to match transactors like a marriage broker would, and (ii) to manage risks and transform the nature of claims as when a bank produces credit information to control a borrower’s [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md). In producing information for application (i), the intermediary acts as a broker, whereas in producing information for application (ii), it acts as a qualitative asset transformer.
