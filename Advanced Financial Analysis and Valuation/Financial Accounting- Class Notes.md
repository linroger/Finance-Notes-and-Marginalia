# Financial Accounting: Class Notes
## 1. Lecture 1
### 1.1 Financial Accounting
+ **Class 1**
    + Three homework assignments

+ **Accounting**
    + "language of business"
    + Collection, processing and reporting of info about activities and events that affect the organization

+ **Three types of accounting users**
    + **Financial Accounting and Reporting**: recording financial transactions, position and results and communicating it to outside stakeholders
    + **Managerial Accounting and Reporting**: communicating the position and results of firm internally.
    + **Tax Accounting and Reporting**: recording and reporting financial position to IRS.

+ **Accounting Principles**
    + Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)

+ **SEC** has authority to set GAAP

+ **SEC delegates this authority to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)**

+ **FASB rules are called Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)** - currently over 150 rules

+ **Attributes of ideal accounting system**
    + Reliability - verifiable by an independent party
    + Relevance - it has to be timely, and have feedback value and predictive ability to a certain extent (you may want to use the info to make future decisions)

+ **Other important accounting concepts**
    + Conservatism - report bad news but not good news if there is uncertainty
    + Materiality - if tracking an account is costly and reporting it doesn't change decisions, it is not worth it.

+ **Accounting Qualities**
    + **Decision Usefulness**
        + Relevance
        + Timely
        + Feedback value - tells you about the past (evaluate the managers of the firm); feedback on past performance and management performance
        + Predictive value
        + Reliability
        + Verifiability
        + Representational faithfulness
        + Neutral (compare firm across years and compare across firms)
        + Comparability
        + Materiality
    + Understandability

+ **Assumptions Underlying Financial Accounting**
    + **Three Assumptions**
        + Entity Concept - parent company and any subsidiaries controlled by the parent; independent subsidiaries are not part of the firm
        + Arm's length transaction
        + Monetary measurement concept
        + Going concern assumption
    + Discretion - accounting information is subject to discretion.
    + Accounting numbers = economic truth + measurement error + incentives
    + **Changes to Accounting Rules and Regulation** - can change due to lobbying, political pressure, economics and technological change

+ **Principal Activities of a Firm**
    + **Sources of capital**
        + Creditors
        + Owners
    + **Investing Activities**
        + Inventory
        + PPE
    + **Operating Activities**
        + Creates value
    + **Value creation**
        + Earnings, profits, etc.
    + **How can a firm return value?**
        + Dividends
        + Reinvest earnings into investing activities of the firm
        + Repay your creditors
    + **FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDE INFORMATION ON EACH STEP**

+ **Role of Financial Reporting**
    + **Who is interested in information about the firm?**
        + S/Hs, potential S/Hs
        + Creditors
        + Suppliers
        + IRS
        + Analysts, other intermediaries
    + **What types of information about the firm?**
        + Performance
        + Revenue, expenses,
        + Ratios
        + Cash flow
        + Assets & liabilities
    + **Supply**
        + **Mandatory disclosures**
        + Annual audited filings with the SEC (10Ks)
        + Quarterly unaudited SEC filings (10Qs)
        + Annual reports - sent to shareholders

+ **Key Players in Financial Reporting**
    + **Preparers**
        + SEC - oversight role - delegated to FASB
        + FASB - rule-making body
        + GAAP - set of rules created by FASB
        + Directors - audit committee responsible for reporting of the firm
        + Auditors - attest to the credibility of the financial reports
        + (Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) - July 30, 2002 - in response to Enron, WorldCom, etc.)
    + **Users**
        + Analysts/Media - third party information providers
        + Investors - large institutions and individuals

+ **International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)**
    + Set of global accounting standards for the preparation of public company financial statements
    + Developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
    + IASB is an independent accounting standard-setting body based in London
    + 12,000 companies in almost 100 nations have adopted IFRS. Many more will transition in 2011
    + FASB and IASB are working towards convergence of US GAAP and IFRS
    + SEC Roadmap
        + 2011: decision whether US Firms are required to use IFRS
        + 2014: implementation year in case of positive decision

+ **Financial Statements**
    + **Basic Financial Statements**
        + Balance Sheet
        + Income Statement
        + Statement of Cash Flows
    + **Supplemental information about the financial condition of a company**
        + Statement of Shareholder's Equity
        + Notes to Financial Statements - footnotes are very important
        + Auditor's Report

+ **The Balance Sheet**
    + A point in time snapshot of the investing and financial activities of the firm
    + Balance sheet identity
        + ASSETS = LIABILITIES + SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
        + E.g.
        + Investments = financial arrangements
        + Resources = claims on resources
        + Owns = owes

+ **The Income Statement**
    + A schedule that presents the results of operations of a firm for a specific period of time.
    + NET INCOME = REVENUES - EXPENSES
        + Revenues - inflows of assets from selling and providing goods or services
        + Expenses - outflows of assets used in generating revenues
    + Note: there is nothing in these definitions that refer to cash
    + **Balance Sheet vs. Income Statement**
        + Income statement links the balance sheet at the beginning of the period with the balance sheet at the end of the period
        + Retained Earnings (RE) is increased each period by the net income of the period and decreased by any dividends declared during the period
        + RE (end of period) = RE (beginning of period) + NET INCOME - DIVIDENDS

+ **Statement of Cash Flows**
    + A schedule that reports the details of where cash came from and where cash went for a period of time.
    + Cash flows are categorized into:
        + Operating: Providing goods and services
        + Investing: Choice of assets used to run operations
        + Financial: Raising capital to pay for assets

+ **Financial Statements: The Link**
    + CASH + NONCASH ASSETS = LIABILITIES + CONTRIBUTED CAPITAL + RETAINED EARNINGS

+ **Other Financial Reporting Items**
    + Statement of Shareholders' Equity - schedule that reconciles the change in S/Hs equity accounts during a period of time
    + Notes to financial statements
    + Auditors' opinion
    + Financial highlights, including trends
    + Management's Discussion and Analysis
    + CEO/CFO Certification

## CHAPTER 2
### THE BALANCE SHEET (P59-61 - NICE SUMMARY OF BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTS)
### ASSETS
+ **Definition**: an asset is an economic resource that is expected to provide future economic value (i.e. generate future cash inflows or reduce future cash outflows)
    + "All assets are future benefits; however not all future benefits are accounting assets"
    + Executory (uncompleted) contracts do not result in assets (must be an exchange)

+ **An asset is included in the balance sheet (i.e. recognized) when:**
    + Ownership - the firm has acquired the right to use it in a past transaction or exchange
    + Measurable - the value of its future benefits can be measured with a reasonable degree of precision

+ **Examples**
    + Cash, Inventory, Accounts Receivable, PPE (property, plant, equipment)
    + Brand name or famous CEO (Warren Buffett) CANNOT be put on the balance sheet
    + Patents are intangible assets (R&D) - GAAP requires that you expense the costs of R&D. If you are generating it yourself, you can put a value to it. How can you verify the value? However, if you buy it from an outside party that establishes a reliable value.

### ASSETS: VALUATION
+ **Three types**
    + **Acquisition or Historical Cost (adv: verifiable/reliable; disadv: may not reflect economic value)**
        + Valued at the amount of resources paid to acquire it
    + **Fair Market Value (adv: closer to market value; disadv: hard to measure)**
        + Replacement cost - entry price (valued at the cost of replacing the asset)
        + Net Realizable Value - exit price (valued at the net cash received on selling the asset)
        + Present value of expected future cash flows (adv: closer to economic value; disadv: reliance on assumptions that may not be accurate)

+ **GAAP on Valuation**
    + **Monetary assets** - an asset whose realization is fixed in terms of dollars
        + Use PV method
        + Examples: Cash, Accounts Receivable
    + **Nonmonetary Asset** - all other assets
        + Historical Cost
        + Examples: PPE, inventory, etc.
        + Exception: marketable securities (valued at Net Realizable Value)

### ASSETS: CLASSIFICATION
+ **Current Assets**: assets expected to be realized in cash within one operating cycle (typically one year)
    + Examples: inventory, accounts receivable

+ **Noncurrent assets**: assets that are NOT expected to be realized in cash within one operating cycle
    + Examples: PPE

+ **Why is this relevant?** Liquidity - it is a measure of liquidity and how quickly you can get the assets out of the firm.

### LIABILITIES
+ **Definition**: a liability is a claim on assets by creditors that represents an obligation to make future payment of cash, gods or services (i.e. consume resources)

+ "All liabilities are obligations; not all obligations are accounting liabilities"

+ **A liability is included in the balance sheet (i.e. recognized) when:**
    + The obligation is based on benefits or services received currently or in a past transaction
    + The amount and timing of payment is reasonably certain ("measurable")

+ **Examples**: accounts payable, notes payable, advances from customers ("prepayment"), warranties

+ Is a lawsuit a liability? No. It is not measurable. This is called a contingent liability. You do have to disclose them in notes.

### LIABILITIES: VALUATION
+ **Monetary liabilities** - liability whose settlement is fixed in terms of dollars (i.e. by contract)
    + Examples: bonds payable
    + Most liabilities require a specific payment
    + Valuation: PV of expected future cash flows

+ **Nonmonetary liabilities** - all others! Typically requires delivery of goods or rendering of service rather than payment of cash
    + Examples: advance from customers, warranty liability
    + Valuation:
        + At face value (amount of resources received (e.g. customer advances)
        + At expected cost of providing service (e.g. warranty liabilities)

### LIABILITIES: CLASSIFICATION
+ **Current liability**: obligation expected to be paid in cash within one operating cycle
    + Example: accounts payable

+ **Non-current liability**: obligation with an expected due date beyond one operating cycle
    + Ex: long-term debt

+ **Current ration**: Current assets/Current Liabilities

+ **Working capital**: CA-CL

+ **Acid Test Ratio (Quick Ratio) = (Cash + Acct Receivable + Short term investment)/Current Liabilities** -→ this basically ignores inventory.

+ If ACID test ratio is less than Current Ratio → Inventory is a big deal. How liquid really is the firm's inventory?

### FAS 159: FAIR VALUE OPTION (FVO)
+ Firms can optionally elect to use fair values to measure eligible assets and liabilities in their financial statements
    + Fair value is the amount a firm would receive if it sold an asset or would pay if it settled a liability at the measurement date
    + Effective date: fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007
    + Management has sufficient discretion in electing specific assets and liabilities, but once FVO is elected it is irrevocable
    + Detailed requirements for applying fair value measurements to the calculation of net income for specific assets and liabilities (e.g. bonds) are still not provided
    + The fair value option is still considered an interim step.

+ **Inputs to Measuring Fair Value (FV)**
    + Level 1: Observable quoted prices in active markets for identical assets/liabilities (MOST RELIABLE)
    + Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted market prices within Level 1
        + Includes quoted prices for similar asses/liabilities in active market
        + Includes quoted prices for identical asses/liability in markets that are not active
        + Observable factors relevant to using present values of cash flows to measure FV
    + Level 3: Unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions (Management's assumptions) about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset/liability. (LEAST RELIABLE)

+ **Disclosures Related to the Fair Value Option (FVO)**
    + Balance Sheet
        + Identify the financial assets/liabilities for which it used the FVO and disclose the reasons for choosing to measure those items at FV
    + Income Statement → exact rules not yet set
    + Notes to Financial Statements
        + Indicate which Level (1, 2 or 3) you used for measuring FV
        + For assets/liabilities valued using more than one of the leels, classify the asset as coming from the lowest level
        + More disclosure around Level 3 management assumptions

### SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
+ **Definition**: shareholders' equity is the residual claim on assets by owners after settling claims of creditors

+ **Valuation**: value of assets MINUS value of liabilities. (A=L+SE)

+ **Two basic components of S/Hs equity**
    + **Contributed capital**: initial investment of S/Hs
        + Preferred stock - first preference for dividends but no voting rights.
        + Common stock - voting rights
        + Additional paid-in capital (APIC) (e.g. if you sell a $1 par value stock in the market for $10 you have $1 common stock and $9 additional paid-in capital
    + **Retained earnings**: additional investment of S/Hs resulting from firms' retention of earnings that belong to owners

+ **Is S/Hs equity (i.e. book value of equity) = market value of equity?**
    + Market value of equity (market cap)
    + **Market to Book Ratio**
        + Ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of S/Hs equity
        + Market value of equity (also known as the market capitalization of the firm) = number of common shares outstanding X market price per share
        + Book value of equity = the accounting value of S/Hs equity
    + **Why would these differ?**
        + Market value reflects the economic values
    + **MV/BV examples**
        + Dell: 12.5
        + Microsoft: 6.18
        + Bank of America: 1.03
        + NOTE: while BoA holds mainly financial assets that are recorded in the accounting, MSFT and DELL have brand name, R&D, etc. that are not incorporated into the balance sheet

### ACCOUNTING CYCLE
+ Lots of transactions
+ Analyze Transactions
+ Create journal entries (two sides must balance)
+ Post to a ledger which is a collection of T-accounts → unadjusted trial balance
+ Adjusting entries
+ Closing entries
+ END OF PERIOD - three financial statements are created

### DOUBLE ENTRY ACCOUNTING SYSTEM
+ Every economic event has two sides - a give and a take
+ Both sides of the transaction are to be recorded
+ The basic accounting equation remains in balance
    + Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity
    + Inv up $100k, Acct Payable up $100k
    + Cash up $3k, Accounts Receivable down $3k
    + PPE up $40M, Notes payable up $40M
    + Cash up $300M, Common stock up $300M
    + Cash down $20k, Accounts payable down $20k

+ Assets, Liabilities and S/Hs Equity are "stored" in accounts
+ T-accounts: easy way to keep track of activity and multiple transactions in an account
+ Account balances
    + Ending balance = beginning balance + increases - decreases

+ **Debit** - an entry which
    + Is made on the left side of the T-Account
    + Increases an asset account
    + Decreases a liability account
    + Decreases a S/Hs equity account

+ **Credit** is an entry which
    + Is made on the right side of the T-Account
    + Decreases an asset account
    + Increases a liability account
    + Incrases a S/Hs equity account

+ Every transaction must have at least one debit and at least one credit
+ Sum of debits = sum of credits
+ E.g. Dr. Inv. 100k; Cr. Acct Pay 100k

## CLASS 2 - 10/6/2008
### BALANCE SHEET DEFINITIONS
+ **Assets**: economic resources with the ability to provide future benefits to a firm

+ **Liabilities**: creditors' claims on the assets of a firm and show some of the sources of the funds the firm uses to acquire the assets.

+ **Shareholders' Equity**: amount of funds owners have provided and, in parallel, their claims on the assets of a firm.

+ **Retained Earnings**: source of funds a firm derives from its earnings that exceed the dividends it has distributed to S/Hs since its formation

+ **Current Liabilities**: obligations a firm expects to pay in one year

+ **Current Assets**: generally convert into cash within one year.

+ **Historical valuation**: reflects the acquisition cost of assets or the amounts of funds originally obtained from creditors or owners

+ **Current Valuation**: reflects the current cost of acquiring assets or the current market value of creditors' and shareholders' claims on a firm.

### INCOME STATEMENT DEFINITIONS
+ **Income Statement**: attempts to answer question "How profitable is the firm?" by showing net income or earnings for a period

+ **Net Income**: revenues - expenses (aka "earnings")

+ **Revenues**: measure of the inflows of assets (or reductions in liabilities) from selling goods and providing services to customers.

+ **Expenses**: measure of outflows of assets (or increases of liabilities) used in generating revenues.

+ **Net Loss**: when expenses for a period exceed revenues.

### EQUATIONS
+ Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity
+ Net Income = revenues - expenses

## Problem 2.29
+ Issued for cash 80,000 shares of #10
    + $800,000
    + Cash: Debit 800,000

+ 4)
    + Dr. Accounts Payable 250,000
    + Cr. Cash 245,000 (2% discount - *250k=5k)

## The Income Statement
+ Presents a "moving picture" of the operating results of a firm for a given period of time (e.g. quarter, fiscal year)
    + Also known as "Statement of Operations, Statement of Earnings

+ **Cash accounting**
    + Cash Accounting - method of accounting where revenues are recorded when cash is received and expenses are recorded when cash is expended.
    + **Advantages**
        + Provides reliable information about cash flows
        + Intuitive and easy to understand
        + Objective - timing of transactions is clear
    + **Disadvantages**
        + Delay in recording revenues/expenses until cash changes hands
        + Poor matching of resources expended to benefits received
        + Subject to manipulation - for example, firm can delay recording an expense by postponing cash payment

+ **Accrual Accounting**
    + Accrual Accounting: method of accounting where revenues and expenses are recorded on an economic basis regardless of the actual flow of cash
        + Revenues recorded when benefits are earned
        + When is revenue earned?
        + Expenses recorded when resources are expended to produce benefits.
    + **Advantages**
        + Better measurement of performance and matching of benefits and costs of transactions
        + Curtails manipulation of cash transactions
    + **Disadvantages**
        + More difficult conceptually (at what point is revenue earned?)
        + Cash is still king
        + Non-cash financial manipulation through discretion and choice in accounting rules
    + Earnings management: use of accounting discretion to distort reported earnings
    + **Methods of Managing Earnings**
        + Cookie Jar Reserves - take hits during good periods (restructuring costs) to smooth out earnings numbers.
        + Concentrate costs in one quarter so future quarters look better. Take a onetime hit, look bad, but then look really good going forward.
        + Financing Arm of company
        + Cutting out R&D costs - particularly pharmaceutical and software companies (other discretionary expenses)
        + Earnings guidance to analysts - manage analyst expectations so market doesn't expect something higher.
        + "Pro forma" earnings - EBITDA (excluding nonrecurring expenses) - be aware that interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, etc. will continue.

+ **Measurement Principles of Accrual Accounting**
    + Measurement involves both timing and amount of the recognition for both revenues and expenses.
        + Timing of revenue recognition
        + Measurement of revenue
        + Timing of expense recognition
        + Measurement of expenses
    + Over the life of the firm:
        + Cash income = accrual income

### REVENUES
+ Revenues: benefits (or increases in net assets) earned by a firm for providing goods and services
    + Net Assets = assets - liabilities = Shareholders' Equity

+ Revenue recognition criteria
    + Firm has delivered the goods to the customer or performed all or most of the services (i.e. it has earned the revenue)
    + Collection of cash (or other benefits) is reasonably assured though some uncertainty may remain (bad debts, warranties)
    + Cash (or other benefits) to be received is measurable

+ How much revenue is recognized in December?
    + A) $500k - because goods delivered - sold on credit
    + B) 0 - this was already recorded in October
    + C) $10k - this is what was earned in December
    + D) 0 revenue - they would have advance from customers
    + E) This is not an income statement item - this would go into "paid in capital"

### EXPENSES
+ **Definition**: Decreases in net assets (not necessarily cash) that arise in the process of generating revenue.

+ The underlying expense recognition concept is the matching principle: recognize costs and/or assets used as expenses in the period in which they generate revenue

+ Expense recognition criteria - expenses are recognized when either:
    + Product costs (costs associated with the production of goods: record in the period when the related revenue is recognized
    + Period costs (cannot easily be matched with revenue: record in the period when the cost is incurred

+ How much expense is recognized in December?
    + A) 0 revenue - not matching to any revenue yet
    + B) 0 revenue - 
    + C) $8,000,000 expense matching to the $15,000,000 in revenue
    + D) $180,000 expenses in December - they did their marketing for that month - hard to match to future
    + E) 25000 in December
    + F) this creates an asset, no revenue
    + G) 0 - dividends are NOT an expense - it is not a part of generating revenues. DIVIDENDS DO NOT GO INTO THE INCOME STATEMENT

### BASIC ACCOUNTING EQUATION WITH REVENUES, EXPENSES AND DIVIDENDS
+ Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders Equity
+ Shareholders' Equity = Contributed Capital + Retained Earnings
+ Retained Earnings = Retained Earnings Beginning + Net Income for Period - Dividend for Period
+ Net Income = Revenues for Period - Expenses for Period

### PURPOSE AND USE OF INDIVIDUAL REVENUE AND EXPENSE ACCOUNTS
+ Revenue and expenses could be recorded directly to the Retained Earnings account
+ It is more informative to collect revenues and expenses separately during the accounting period.
+ At the end of the accounting period, revenues and expenses are cleared (reset to zero) for the new accounting period. Their balances flow into Retained Earnings. This is "closing" the accounts
+ Revnues and expense accounts are temporary accounts. In contrast, the balance sheet accounts (asset, liability and S/Hs equity) are permanent accounts whose balances carry over each period

### DOUBLE ENTRY ACCOUNTING SYSTEM
+ Revenue: increases credit the account (increase an asset); Decreases debit the account
+ Expenses: increases are debited; decreases are credited
+ Closing revenue account
    + If you have a credit in revenue
    + Dr. Revenue by X
    + Cr. Retained Earnings by X
    + Expenses, if you have a balance of Y
    + Cr Expense Account by Y
    + Dr. Retained Earnings by X
+ Shareholders Equity
    + Increases → credited
    + Decreases → debited
+ EXAM: DIVIDENDS ARE NOT AN EXPENSE
