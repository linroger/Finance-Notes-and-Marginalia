## BLACKSTONE AND THE SALE OF CITIGROUP'S LOAN PORTFOLIO

At the end of March 2008, Bennett J. Goodman (HBS'84), a Senior Managing Director at [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]], one of the world's largest [[Private Equity|private equity firms]], was reviewing materials for the potential purchase of a $6.11 billion pool of [[Note On LBO Capital Structure Module Note|leveraged loans]] from Citigroup, one of the world's largest [[HKS The Banking Industry|banking]] entities. Most of these loans were used to finance large [[Note on LBO [[Introduction to Corporate Finance|Capital Structure]] Module Note|Note On LBO [[Introduction to Corporate Finance|Capital Structure]]|leveraged buyouts]] ([[Note on LBO [[Introduction to Corporate Finance|Capital Structure]] Module Note|Note On LBO [[Introduction to Corporate Finance|Capital Structure]]|LBOs]]) that had been announced in late 2006 and early 2007. In a number of cases, [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]] had considered making an equity [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]. The research and due diligence that [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]] had performed in the process gave Goodman some degree of confidence that he understood the risks in the loan [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]]. TPG, another large [[Private Equity|private equity]] firm that was considering partnering with [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]] in purchasing the loan pool, had also researched and even participated in many of the [[Note on LBO [[Introduction to Corporate Finance|Capital Structure]] Module Note|Note On LBO [[Introduction to Corporate Finance|Capital Structure]]|LBOs]].

[[Note On LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Leveraged loans]], including those in the loan pool, were generally trading well below par. The [[Chapter 20-Macroeconomic Policies in the Global Economy|subprime mortgage crisis]], which erupted in 2007, had led to a re-[[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] of a wide range of [[Corporate Bonds and Loans|debt instruments]]. Some of this re-[[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] came from the recognition that risk had been underestimated in the credit boom of the mid-2000s. But Goodman thought that some of the re-[[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]]—perhaps even most of it—was driven by investors' excessive risk aversion and retrenchment from risky assets, fire sales, and general lack of [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] in [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial markets]]. This appeared to create an opportunity to generate superior risk-adjusted [[Assets|returns]] by investing in a large [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] of credits priced below their fundamental value. The [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] would require [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]] to value and manage a set of opaque and highly illiquid [[Lecture Notes Bonds,  Preferred Stock,  and Structured Products|fixed income]] assets. It would also require large amounts of funding, and the capacity to hold their position for an extended period until debt values recovered.

Citigroup would facilitate the transaction by providing [[Contemporary Financial Intermediation Notes|debt financing]] for the purchase of the loan pool. [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]] would provide the rest of the funds, and would stand in the first loss position. As protection for Citigroup, the debt was secured by the loan pool. Citigroup required that the loan pool be marked to market and, in the event the value of the loan pool fell below a certain threshold, Citigroup had the right to request additional collateral.
Goodman, along with Tripp Smith and Doug Ostrover, had just earlier that month closed the sale of their firm, GSO Capital Partners, to [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]] for approximately $1.0 billion. GSO became the credit and [[A [[An Asset Allocation Primer|Primer]] on [[HomeMax Case Study Solution|Distressed Investing]]|distressed debt]] division of [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]] alongside the firm's [[Private Equity|Private Equity]], Real Estate and Fund of Funds businesses.

While the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] opportunity seemed attractive, and had the support of a number of GSO's general partners, the very dislocations in the market that gave rise to the opportunity also brought substantial risk. In recent months, [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial markets]] had witnessed a set of events that would have been hard to imagine a year earlier. Just a few days prior, [[The Fall of Bear Stearns|Bear Stearns]]—one of the most prominent global [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] banks—had collapsed, leading [[Case Study of JP Morgan|JPMorgan Chase]] to buy the bank for a small fraction of its value a year earlier, and then only with assistance from the Federal Reserve. And the economy had moved into a deep recession.  Goodman questioned whether anyone could predict how markets would evolve over the next year. He wondered how Steve Schwarzman (CEO) and Tony James (President) would react to such a high profile transaction in the face of such uncertainty. Was the loan pool a great buying opportunity or a great opportunity to remain on the sidelines?

## CITIGROUP'S LEVERAGED LOAN EXPOSURE

In the second half of 2007, the [[HKS The Banking Industry|banking]] industry and [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial markets]] began to show signs of considerable stress brought on, in large part, by rising [[Default Rates Recovery Rates and Credit Losses|default rates]] on residential mortgages and the decline in the value of residential [[Fremont Financial Corp. (b)|mortgage-backed securities]]. On November 4, 2007, Citigroup announced that the decline in the fair value of its $55 billion in U.S. sub-prime related direct exposures could be as much as 20%.b By the end of 2007, Citigroup's financial results were significantly affected by write-downs related to subprime exposures, leveraged lending, a slowdown in [[Lecture Notes 9- Corporate Securities And Credit Derivatives|investment banking]] activities, and the collapse of the private label [[10. Other Topics in Quantitative Finance|securitization]] market. Net income was down 83%, and the [[Chapter 16 - Black–Scholes Model|stock price]] was down 47% relative to 2006. While Citigroup still appeared to be "well capitalized" from a regulatory capital perspective, its capitalization ratios had declined despite efforts to bolster them.c With the prospect that it would incur further losses in the months to come, Citigroup was focused on ensuring that it would continue to meet [[Case Study of Northern Rock|regulatory capital requirements]].

One particular source of concern was Citigroup's [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] of [[Note On LBO Capital Structure Module Note|leveraged loans]], which at the end of
2007 stood at $22 billion. Most of Citigroup's [[HBS-Blackstone And The Sale Of Citigroup's Loan Portfolio|leveraged loan exposure]] was for [[Note on LBO [[Introduction to Corporate Finance|Capital Structure]] Module Note|Note On LBO [[Introduction to Corporate Finance|Capital Structure]]|LBOs]] that had been announced in late 2006 and early 2007, including Alltel, First Data, TXU, and Harrah's Entertainment.

Exhibit 1 lists the largest LBO loans arranged by Citigroup. Exhibit 2 shows the total volume of leveraged loan issuance through the first quarter of 2008.
As the lead underwriter of a loan, Citigroup's goal was to profit from underwriting fees and sell the bulk of the loans to a syndicate of investors, including other banks, mutual funds, [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]], insurance companies and sponsors of collateralized loan obligations (Close) and [[Credit Markets Session 5|collateralized debt obligations]] (CDOs). As part of the underwriting process, Citigroup would have to commit to fund the buyout even if it was unable to place the loans with other banks and [[Chapter 4 Institutional Trading|institutional investors]]. A large LBO typically used senior unsecured notes in addition to loans. Notes also promised lucrative underwriting fees and Citigroup was willing to fully guarantee funding by committing to issue a bridge loan to make up any shortfall in financing. Providing such a funding guarantee facilitated the transaction, but posed risks to Citigroup in the event it could not place the debt. This risk was realized in [[The Fall of Bear Stearns Lost Opportunities Haunt Final Days of Bear Stearns; Executives Bickeredover Raising Cash Cutting Mortgages|the fall]] of 2007 when [[HBR Case Study- Oaktree|securitization markets]] shut down and [[Chapter 4 Institutional Trading|institutional investors]] were reluctant to invest in [[Note On LBO Capital Structure Module Note|leveraged loans]] and notes. As a result, [[HBS-Blackstone And The Sale Of Citigroup's Loan Portfolio|Citigroup's leveraged loan portfolio]] ballooned to $22 billion.  Several of these positions were leftovers from failed syndicated efforts. Further, Citigroup had committed to another $21 billion of [[Note On LBO Capital Structure Module Note|leveraged loans]].

Citigroup's [[HBS-Blackstone And The Sale Of Citigroup's Loan Portfolio|leveraged loan exposure]] posed two main challenges for the bank. First, [[Note On LBO Capital Structure Module Note|leveraged loans]] were costly from a regulatory capital perspective since they received a 100% risk weight. By contrast, real estate loans only received a 50% risk weight, and highly rated securities only a 20% weight.  With a capital requirement of 8%, this would mean that Citigroup would need $80 million of capital for every billion dollars of leveraged loans.  Reducing its leveraged loan portfolio would ease Citigroup's capital requirements, but might entail selling the loans below their fundamental value, possibly at fire sale prices. The second challenge posed by holding these loans was posed by their accounting treatment. Since a substantial fraction of these loans was intended to be sold and as such would be classified as "held-for-sale" under accounting requirements, their value was marked-tomarket. With the leveraged-loan index (LCDX) dropping to 97 cents on the dollar in the fall of 2007 (from par level in summer of the same year), Citigroup had to recognize $1.5 billion losses on its leveraged loan [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] for the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2007. By March of 2008, the LCDX index dropped to 92 cents on the dollar, and analysts estimated that write-downs on the leveraged loan [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] for the first quarter of 2008 could be as high as the total [[Note On LBO Capital Structure Module Note|leveraged loans]] related losses for 2007. Volatility in the [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] of [[Note On LBO Capital Structure Module Note|leveraged loans]] would add further volatility into Citigroup's earnings and its [[Chapter 16 - Black–Scholes Model|stock price]].

## THE LOAN PORTFOLIO TRANSACTION

With these concerns in mind, Citigroup approached several large investors, including [[Private Equity|private equity firms]] and [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]], about purchasing [[Note On LBO Capital Structure Module Note|leveraged loans]] from its [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]].
[[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]], along with its partner, TPG, expressed interest in a [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] that contained sixteen different issuers with total face value of $6.11 billion from the total $22 billion [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]]. (See Exhibit 3.) Most of the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] was comprised of debt used to fund deals reviewed by [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]] and/or led by TPG. The largest exposure, accounting for 25% of the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]], was debt used to fund the 2007 buyout of Alltel sponsored by TPG and Goldman Sachs Capital. The riskiest debt instrument in the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] was Harrah's senior unsecured notes used to fund the 2008 LBO sponsored by TPG and Apollo. These notes comprised 3% of the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]].

Overall, roughly 75% of the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] was comprised of [[Note On LBO Capital Structure Module Note|senior secured debt]] holding first-lien claim on borrowers' fixed and [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D, Intangibles, M&A & Goodwill#[[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D, Intangibles, M&A & Goodwill|INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION]] AND NON‐GAAP REPORTING|intangible]] assets. The remaining 25% comprised of unsecured bonds.

For example, Harrah's buyout was announced on October 2, 2008 and approved by shareholders on December 19, 2006. At that point, the transaction included commitments of $5.9 billion of equity and $15.8 billion of new debt.  Harrah's was the world's largest gaming and lodging company. However, for the transaction to be closed, the buyers had to go through a long and arduous process of obtaining casino licenses in every state where Harrah's operated. The necessary regulatory approvals for Harrah's were finalized on December 24, 2007, two month ahead of the expected date. The financing of the acquisition was closed on January 28, 2008.

The weighted average coupon of the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] was LIBOR+309 basis points (bps).e (See **Exhibit 4** for information on the forward LIBOR.) The weighted average coupon for the [[Note On the Leveraged Loan Market|senior secured loans]] in the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] was LIBOR+277 bps. On average, the loans in the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] were rated "B"/"B-".

## FINANCING

After some period of negotiation, [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]], TPG and Citigroup set the purchase price for the$6.11 billion loan portfolio at 83 cents on the dollar.f Citigroup offered to provide 80% leverage for senior secured loans and 60% leverage for senior unsecured notes. Overall, Citigroup offered nonrecourse debt financing for 75% of the purchase price. According to the deal terms, Blackstone and TPG would contribute a total of $1.26 billion of equity.

 ![500](Z.%20Clippings/HBS-[[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]]%20And%20The%20Sale%20Of%20Citigroup's%20Loan%20Portfolio-20240427154038662.png)

The cost of the Citigroup financing was LIBOR+100 bps. The financing had a tenor that matched the average maturity of the loans in the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] with the interest payment not due until after the coupon interest was received from the instruments in the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]].  Moreover, the financing included a "recycling provision," which gave [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]] the ability to use the same financing terms for reinvestment in any assets as long as the total credit did not exceed $3.81 billion. This meant that [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]] could at, any point, further diversify its [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] by selling some of their positions and reinvesting the proceeds in other loans. The recycling provision would be available for four years from the loan closing.

The underlying loan [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] would be used as collateral on the $3.81 billion financing. If the total value of the loans fell below 66.4% of its face value (80% of the purchase price), [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]] and TPG would have to post additional collateral. (See **Figure A**.)

## ASSESSING THE DEAL

A key to the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] from [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]]'s perspective was that the loan [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] was substantially undervalued. In its view, [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]] had carefully selected the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] so that the expected [[Default Rates Recovery Rates and Credit Losses|default rates]] would be smaller than those for average "B"-rated securities, which historically were estimated at 5.91% for the first year (**Exhibit 5**). The [[Credit Markets Session 3|default probabilities]] implied by credit default swaps (CDS) were substantially higher. For example, the CDS for Harrah's Entertainment notes implied a default probability in the subsequent year of 20.82% (=1147.35 bps/(10.449), where 0.449 is the historical [[Credit Markets Session 3|recovery rate]] on defaulted senior unsecured notes).g (Historical recovery rates are reported in Exhibit 6. **Exhibit 7** provides data on credit default swaps spreads for the senior [[HBR Case Study- Oaktree|unsecured debt]] of the issuers in the Citigroup loan [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]].)
Even if the market was indeed wrong, there were several [[PSET 6- Financial Instruments|risk factors]] to consider. Although [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]] tried to assemble a diverse [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]], a default for any individual credit would adversely impact [[Assets|returns]]. [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]] was also not a financial sponsor in the underlying buyouts. If [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|fundamentals]] of the underlying issuers were to deteriorate, as a holder of debt, [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]] would not have control over managerial and operational decisions.
If the market was mispricing the loans, [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]] and TPG could just wait for loans to mature.

However, their [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] would be subject to quarterly mark-to-[[Chapter 5 - Index Futures|market risk]]. If the market values continued to drop they could be subject to a margin call, requiring [[Week 6 Assignment Review|Blackstone]] to post collateral. This would adversely impact the equity [[Assets|returns]]. While the cushion against a margin call seemed reasonably large, the [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007–2011)|economic conditions]] and, specifically, the conditions of the [[Note on the Leveraged Loan Market|leveraged loan market]] had been deteriorating for over half a year. When the market would hit the bottom and when it would start to recover was hard to say even for a debt market veteran like Goodman. (See Exhibit 8 for Bennett J. Goodman's biography).

A CDS is a contract that promises a payoff to the buyer in the event a particular loan or bond defaults (such as failing to make interest payments or filing for [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] protection).  Should a default occur, the buyer of a CDS is paid par value in exchange for the underlying debt instrument, or is paid the difference between par value and the market value of the debt instrument. In exchange for this insurance, the buyer makes quarterly payments to the seller. These payments are referred to as the [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]] and are quoted in basis points per year.  Thus, a loan with a [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]] of 500 basis points requires the buyer to pay 5% of the par value to the seller on an yearly basis or 1.25% per quarter.  Higher spreads correspond either to a higher default probability, a lower [[Credit Markets Session 3|recovery rate]], or both. Here, the [[Credit Markets Session 3|recovery rate]] is assumed fixed. To estimate default probability implied by CDS spreads, one could use the following formula: Probability of default in a given year = [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]] / *(1-[[Credit Markets Session 3|Recovery rate]])*.
