# HBS Westlake Case

Westlake generates value primarily as a vertically integrated producer of commodity petrochemicals, specifically in the olefins and vinyls chains. In the olefins segment, which accounted for 62% of 2003 sales (Exhibit 5A), Westlake uses natural gas-derived feedstocks (ethane) to produce ethylene. Ethylene is then used to produce polyethylene and styrene. Westlake has 2,800mm lbs of annual ethylene capacity and 1,400mm lbs of polyethylene capacity (Exhibit 9A), making it the 8th largest producer in North America with a 4% share of industry capacity (Exhibit 7A).

In the vinyls segment (38% of 2003 sales), Westlake produces PVC and VCM, which also use ethylene as a key input, along with chlorine. Westlake has 900mm lbs of PVC capacity and 450mm lbs of VCM capacity (Exhibit 9A), making it the 5th largest PVC producer in North America with a 4% market share (Exhibit 8A). Westlake also converts some of its PVC into downstream fabricated products like pipes and fittings.

So in essence, Westlake captures value by participating in multiple steps of the ethylene value chain (Exhibit 6), benefiting from its vertical integration. It uses attractively priced natural gas/ethane as a feedstock to produce ethylene, then converts the ethylene into polyethylene, styrene, VCM and PVC to generate higher value sales. Historically, over 85% of Westlake's sales have been in the U.S. market.

## Key Risks

Westlake faces several key risks:

1) **Exposure to volatile natural gas prices** (its key feedstock): As shown in Exhibit 1A, natural gas prices have historically been very volatile, with spikes as high as $9/MMBtu in 2000 and 2003. Since Westlake uses 90%+ ethane/natural gas as its feedstock (vs. global peers who use more naphtha), it is highly exposed to this volatility in U.S. natural gas prices. Exhibit 7C shows how ethylene margins tend to follow the opposite pattern of natural gas prices.

2) **Cyclicality of the commodity chemicals industry**: Exhibit 7B shows the "boom and bust" nature of operating rates in the ethylene industry. Periods of high operating rates (95%+) enable peak margins, but are followed by periods of oversupply and depressed margins. Westlake has limited pricing power to offset this cyclicality. PVC demand is also sensitive to interest rates and construction activity (Exhibit 1C).

3) **Lack of product differentiation**: As mainly a commodity producer, Westlake's products are not highly differentiated vs. peers. Exhibit 2 highlights the commodity chemical industry traits of simple products, low prices, and high price competition. This limits Westlake's ability to generate a sustainable competitive advantage.

4) **High capital intensity**: The commodity chemicals industry is characterized by high capital requirements, with long lead times to build new capacity. This can result in overcapacity situations during industry downturns.

So in summary, while Westlake benefits from vertical integration, its profitability is highly sensitive to external factors like natural gas prices, industry operating rates, and the health of end markets like construction. Navigating the peaks and troughs of the chemical industry cycle is a key challenge for management.

## Analysis Questions and Responses

### 1. Value Generation and Key Risks

Westlake generates value by being a vertically integrated producer of commodity petrochemicals, specifically olefins (ethylene, polyethylene, styrene) and vinyls (PVC, VCM). They use natural gas-derived feedstocks to produce these chemicals.

The key risks are the volatility in natural gas prices (their main feedstock) and the cyclicality of the commodity chemical industry. As Exhibit 1 shows, natural gas prices have been very volatile, spiking as high as $9/MMBtu in late 2000 and early 2003. This directly impacts Westlake's input costs and profitability.

The industry is also very cyclical, with periods of tight supply/high margins followed by oversupply/depressed margins (Exhibit 7 Panel B). Westlake has limited pricing power as a commodity producer. So their performance depends heavily on where we are in the chemical cycle.

### 2. Current Environment Assessment (October 2004)

Based on the data, the current environment in October 2004 looks relatively positive for Westlake's near-term outlook:
- Ethylene operating rates have recovered to nearly 95% (Exhibit 7B), enabling peak margins
- Ethylene prices have increased substantially to over 40 cents/lb (Exhibit 7C)
- Estimated peak ethylene margin is 16 cents/lb, a 7.4 cent increase over 2003 (Exhibit 9C)
- Vinyls (PVC) prices and margins have also increased significantly (Exhibit 9C)

So Westlake appears well-positioned to deliver strong earnings in the near-term, taking advantage of the favorable point in the chemical cycle. The main risk is the still elevated natural gas prices.

### 3. Peak EPS Estimation

To estimate Westlake's EPS at the peak of the cycle:
- Start with 2003 EPS of $0.30 (Exhibit 3B)
- Ethylene peak margin is estimated at 16.0 cents/lb after-tax (Exhibit 9C), a 7.4 cent increase vs. 2003
- Multiply the 7.4 cent increase by Westlake's ethylene capacity of 2,800mm lbs (Exhibit 9A) = $207mm of incremental gross profit
- Assuming a 34% tax rate, that equates to $137mm of incremental net income
- Dividing by 49.5mm diluted shares outstanding = incremental EPS of $2.77
- PVC peak margin estimated at 12.8 cents/lb after-tax, a 9.7 cent increase vs. 2003
- Multiply 9.7 cent increase by PVC capacity of 900mm lbs = $87mm incremental gross profit
- After 34% tax, equals $58mm of incremental net income
- Dividing by 49.5mm shares = incremental EPS of $1.17
- Adding the $2.77 and $1.17 to the base 2003 EPS of $0.30 = estimated peak EPS of $4.24

### 4. Valuation Implications

I would be cautious about using this $4.24 estimate of peak EPS in a forward P/E multiple valuation, for a few reasons:
- It may not be sustainable. The peak of the cycle could be short-lived before margins retreat again.
- There are timing uncertainties around when the peak will occur and how long it will last.
- The estimate relies on key assumptions, such as the peak margins, that may not fully materialize.
- It doesn't account for risks like continued natural gas price volatility that could pressure margins.

As a result, I would apply a discounted multiple to this peak EPS figure to account for its uncertain timing and sustainability. The multiple should also reflect the volatility and risks inherent in Westlake's commodity chemicals business. A sum-of-the-parts valuation, assigning a lower multiple to the vinyls segment, could also make sense given its greater cyclicality.

In summary, while the peak cycle EPS estimate is a useful data point, I would be conservative in applying a multiple to it for valuation purposes given the transitory nature of peak chemical industry profits. Westlake's stock will likely trade at a discounted multiple to more stable chemical companies.

## Industry Cyclicality Analysis

The commodity chemical industry is highly cyclical, which has a major impact on Westlake's financial performance. The key factors that characterize the cycle are:

1) **Supply/demand balances and operating rates**: Exhibit 7B shows how North American ethylene operating rates have fluctuated between 80-96% over 2001-2004. Periods of tight supply, such as 1995 and 2004, result in operating rates above 95%. This enables producers to raise prices and earn peak margins. However, this attracts new capacity investment, leading to oversupply and operating rates dipping below 85%, as occurred in 2001-2002 following the recession. Low operating rates result in falling prices and compressed margins.

2) **Pricing and margins**: Exhibit 7C shows how ethylene prices have ranged from ~20 to 44 cents per pound during 1994-2004, with margins between 0-16 cents per pound. Prices and margins tend to be highest when operating rates are above 90%. Exhibit 9C shows peak ethylene margin estimates of 16 cents/lb, well above the 8.6 cent margin achieved in 2003.

3) **Feedstock costs**: Westlake's margins are also highly sensitive to the cost of natural gas, its primary feedstock. Exhibit 1A shows the volatility in natural gas prices, which spiked above $8/MMBtu in 2000 and 2003. Higher natural gas prices pressure Westlake's margins, partially offset by higher ethylene/polyethylene prices (Exhibit 7C).

4) **Demand from end markets**: Demand for PVC and other vinyls is closely tied to construction activity, which in turn depends on interest rates and the health of the U.S. economy. Exhibit 1C shows the decline in 30-year mortgage rates since 2000. Low interest rates stimulate housing demand and construction activity.

Based on the data available in October 2004, the current industry environment appears favorable for Westlake's near-term outlook:

1) Ethylene operating rates have recovered to 95%+ (Exhibit 7B), enabling higher prices and margins. Ethylene prices have increased from 30 cents/lb in 2003 to over 40 cents/lb (Exhibit 7C). The estimated peak ethylene margin of 16 cents/lb (Exhibit 9C) is well above the 8.6 cent margin realized in 2003.

2) PVC prices have increased from $480/ton in 2003 to over $700/ton (Exhibit 8C), with peak after-tax margins estimated at 12.8 cents/lb vs. 3.1 cents/lb in 2003 (Exhibit 9C).

3) Interest rates remain low (Exhibit 1C), supporting construction activity and PVC demand.

4) None of the major North American ethylene producers have announced plans for capacity additions, reducing the risk of another oversupply situation in the near-term.

However, there are risks to this positive outlook that could impact Westlake's performance:

1) Natural gas prices remain elevated near $6/MMBtu (Exhibit 1A), well above historical averages. Continued volatility in natural gas prices could pressure Westlake's margins.

2) The positive ethylene/PVC fundamentals could prompt producers to announce new capacity investments, sowing the seeds for the next downturn.

3) An unexpected slowdown in U.S. economic growth or an increase in interest rates could impact demand and pricing for PVC and other construction materials.

So while Westlake appears well-positioned to benefit from the favorable supply/demand fundamentals in late 2004, the inherent cyclicality and volatility of the commodity chemicals industry remains an ongoing risk. Westlake's strong performance in the current up-cycle could prove temporary if conditions were to deteriorate. Management will need to carefully consider the timing and magnitude of any capacity investments to avoid contributing to future oversupply.
