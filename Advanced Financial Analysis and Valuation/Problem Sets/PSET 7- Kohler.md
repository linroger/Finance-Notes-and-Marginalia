1. Why does [Herbert Kohler](HBS%20Kohler%20A.md) want to do the recapitalization? Provide a brief discussion.
	1. [Herbert Kohler](HBS%20Kohler%20A.md) wants to do the recapitalization primarily to preserve family ownership and control over [Kohler Co](../Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%207/Week%207-%20Private,%20Family%20and%20Closely‐held%20Firms%20-Analysis%20and%20Valuation.md). As a private company, [Kohler Co](../Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%207/Week%207-%20Private,%20Family%20and%20Closely‐held%20Firms%20-Analysis%20and%20Valuation.md). could take a long-term perspective and make strategic investments without being subjected to public scrutiny and short-term pressures from outside shareholders. Kohler believed that the company's private status was crucial to its success and [competitive advantage](../Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%206/Week%206%20Bank%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation.md). The recapitalization aimed to eliminate outside shareholders by either buying out their shares or exchanging them for new restricted classes of shares that could only be transferred within the Kohler family and affiliated entities.
	- Moreover, the recapitalization reinforced absolute family ownership, which was crucial for quick decision-making and focusing on the development of products and services.This aligns with Kohler's [business strategy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Gordon%20Bargain%20Stores%20B.md) of maintaining healthy [cash flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) and pursuing steady expansion. Additionally, by controlling ownership and the structure of shareholdings, the recapitalization helped safeguard the company against potential hostile takeovers, ensuring that family governance and the legacy of the founder remained intact.
	- The recapitalization also allowed Kohler to realign its share structure, creating classes with different rights and benefits. This facilitated future financial planning and helped maintain control over [financial decisions](../Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md) without external pressures.
2. What are the key differences between using the DCF approach to value a private firm vs. a public firm? Provide a list of bullet points with short comments.
	- [Availability of information](.md): Public firms are required to disclose detailed financial information, making it easier to obtain reliable data for DCF analysis. Private firms may not have the same level of transparency, making it harder to assess their [financial performance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Gordon%20Bargain%20Stores%20B.md).
	- [Liquidity and marketability](.md): Public firms generally have more liquid and active trading of their shares, while private firm shares are illiquid and have limited marketability, potentially warranting [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) discounts.
	- [Control and minority considerations](.md): DCF valuations of public firms typically reflect the value of a minority, non-controlling interest. Private firm valuations may need to consider control premiums or minority discounts, depending on the specific circumstances.
	- [Growth assumptions](.md): Private firms may have more flexibility in pursuing long-term growth strategies without the pressure of meeting short-term [market expectations](../../Clippings/Forward%20Rate.md), allowing for different [growth assumptions](.md) in the [DCF model](PSET%205-%20Pharmaceuticals%20And%20Intangibles%20In%20Valuation.md). They are also more susceptible to minority shareholder expropriation.
	- [Discount rate](.md): The [discount rate](.md) for a private firm may be higher due to potentially higher risks associated with illiquidity, lack of diversification, and limited information.
3. Use a DCF valuation and multiples to determine the total enterprise value of Kohler as of
April 30, 1998. The spreadsheet posted on Canvas guides you through the process. Much
of the process is a review of standard DCF and WACC calculations.
- To determine the enterprise value of Kohler, we identified that the company's performance is primarily driven by its plumbing products, with the remainder attributable to its power engine products. [Peer companies](../BMW%20Valuation.md) were identified for these two business units and weights of 80/20 were assigned when calculating equity/debt discount rates and WACC.
- For the [DCF model](PSET%205-%20Pharmaceuticals%20And%20Intangibles%20In%20Valuation.md), we calculated the T+1 FCF by applying the terminal year growth rate to the 2022 EBIT, subtracting a 43% tax expense, and carrying over other items except for deferred tax assets/liabilities and other assets. The Total Beta WACC was selected to calculate the terminal value and discount factors. We arrived at an enterprise value of $760.76 million, a firm equity value of $530.77 million, and a price per share of $69,950.

- Under the multiple method, we used the average implied EV based on the four multiples and arrived at a per share price at $214,813.

4. Next, using your enterprise valuations in question 4 as starting points, determine the
value of a share for Kohler’s minority shareholders using the DCF and multiples
methods. Incorporate any discounts that you think are appropriate. Please explain. The
Damodaran reading provides some background on commonly used discounts. The
spreadsheet provides further guidance only on where to input the discounts (the values
are at your discretion).
- We elected to use a 20% minority discount and a 20% [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) discount. Regarding the minority discount, given that the typical range in the market is 20-30%, we selected the lower end of the range because Kohler is a well-established company with stable operations. Historically, there have also been buy-backs and other exit opportunities offered to minority shareholders. According to an article by Damodaran, the typical range for a [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) discount is 20-30%, with a benchmark discount of 25% for a firm with positive earnings. Considering that Kohler is a large and financially healthy company with a likelihood of going public in the future, we believe a lower [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) discount of 20% is more applicable. After applying these two discounts, the price per share decreased from $69,950 to $44,768.

5. Now consider [Herbert Kohler](HBS%20Kohler%20A.md)’s claim that $55,400 is the appropriate price for a share
held by a minority shareholder. What minority and [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) discounts would you have to
use to justify this share price? How are these similar to or different from the discounts
you used in question 4? Please explain.
- To arrive at the offered price of \$55, 400, we would have to apply a 15% minority discount and 7% [marketability discount](../Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%207/Week%207-%20Private,%20Family%20and%20Closely‐held%20Firms%20-Analysis%20and%20Valuation.md) to account for the illiquid nature of these shares.
- Considering that $55,400 is determined to be an appropriate price per share for minority shareholders, it implies lower minority and [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) discounts than we initially expected. Specifically, a 15% minority discount and a 7% [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) discount could account for this share price. The lower discounts could suggest that, compared to general firms, Kohler offers more favorable conditions for minority shareholders in relation to buy-back policies and investor relations. Additionally, the company has higher [financial stability](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) and potential for a public offering in the future.
