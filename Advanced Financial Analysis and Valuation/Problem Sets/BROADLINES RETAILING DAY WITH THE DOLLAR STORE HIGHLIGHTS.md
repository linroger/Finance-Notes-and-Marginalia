# BROADLINES RETAILING DAY WITH THE DOLLAR STORE HIGHLIGHTS

On June 12th, we hosted our 1st Annual Dollar Store Tour in Chicago featuring more than a dozen members of management from Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Family Dollar, and Big Lots. Overall, the tour served as an opportunity to compare/contrast each low-end retailer, while also obtaining a better understanding of the merchandising initiatives underway at each company. Below and enclosed, we have outlined the key takeaways from each stop on the tour and our latest sector update on the dollar space.

- **Deal$Store:** Key highlights included: (1) multi price point strategy (~20% of SKU's >$1.00), (2) impressive lifestyle overhead signage, (3) solid endcap displays featuring "wow" items, including NY steaks (6 for $9) and $5 Prowalk leather sneakers, & (4) multi-price point items clearly marked with orange signage vs. $1 items only in green. Of some concern, it is clear that store labor is higher (vs. Avg. Tree store) and because of the need to display pricing (particularly in consumables area) the labels created a somewhat cluttered feel, in our view.
- **Dollar Tree:** Key highlights included: (1) impressive store layout featuring race track format and clear sightlines, (2) build-a-basket theme continues as a way for DLTR to overcome $1 price barrier, (3) improved end-cap displays, including Arizona Iced Tea and Spiderman, (4) multi-price point strategy not present - testing in 25 stores during FY 07.
- **Dollar General:** Overall store appearance was the worst of the five stores we toured with poor sightlines, numerous missing displays, and lackluster presentation. According to management, pack-away clearance of $300 million of excess inventory is roughly 2/3 complete and DG is looking to augment its private label mix and reduce SKU's as a private company.
- **Big Lots:** Key highlights included: (1) Pier 1 merchandise looked good and was located at front entrance, (2) expanded furniture assortment (~1,100 stores) was impressive with $299-$399 Ashley sofas and Serta mattresses representing top attractions, and (3) improved in-store signage (new package rolled out in 1Q) provided better organization of categories and highlighted name brand items with a focus on end-cap displays.
- **Family Dollar:** Key highlights included: (1) apparel strategy featuring a narrowed assortment (~40% less SKUs YOY), less styles per fixture (40 in past vs. 12 today), and more aggressive markdown strategy to limit packaway, (2) Hanes assortment and display of men's/women's undergarments looked impressive, (3) expanded food assortment (1 additional aisle), and (4) corral area to reduce shrink in front of store (i.e. batteries, candy, etc.).

## STOP #1: DEAL$

Our first stop on the tour was Deal$ in Matteson, IL. We note the following highlights from the store tour:

[^1]: **Multi Price Point Initiatives:** Dollar Tree has approached its multi-price point initiative with a three-pronged approach, including:
   a. **Complete the Assortment:** This initiative involves adding higher price point SKU's in order to round out the customer's total basket where possible. A key example pointed out on the tour was a gallon of milk for $3.00 (pint in Dollar Tree for $1).
   b. **Stock Up & Save:** This initiative is geared toward increasing the product package size where possible through the use of multi-price points. Specific examples in the store included laundry detergent (36 loads for $2.50 at Deal$ vs. 4 loads for $1.00 at Dollar Tree) and Ajax dish detergent (64 oz. for $3.00 vs. 16 oz. for $1.00).
   c. **Treasure Hunt:** Using a multi-price point approach, the company believes this allows greater flexibility to highlight "wow" items throughout the store, which should increase traffic through word of mouth publicity. Items observed included Prowalk leather tennis shoes for $5 ($20 retail), NY steaks for $1.50/each, and ethnic hair care products.

[^2]: **80% $1 Items vs. 20% Multi Price Point Split**: Management commented that approximately 80% of the store (sales volume) was comprised of products at the $1.00 price point with the remaining 20% holding a higher price point. On SKU's, it was estimated that slightly less than 20% were multi-price points, but our sense was this figure was higher. All items in the store at the $1.00 price point were clearly marked by green signage with the multi price point items highlighted with orange signage.

[^3]: **Crowded Signage Raises A Concern**: On a negative point, we observed an overabundance of price signage, particularly in the consumables area, in which the level of detail was overdone, in our view. Specifically, in many instances the excessive labeling on aisles created a cluttered and disorganized feel to the product assortment. In addition, it was clear that store level labor was higher as associates were needed to regularly change/update the signage throughout the store.

[^4]: **Overall Store Observations**: The overall look and feel in the store was impressive featuring lifestyle graphics and overhead signage highlighting specific categories within the store. In addition, the aisles were clearly marked particularly $1.00 items (green) vs. Multi-price point items (orange) creating an organized shopping experience. The front-end of the store looked solid with a seasonal assortment of outdoor seasonal items (e.g. beach towels, pool accessories). In addition, the food and coolers area (far left of store) was well organized with fully stocked coolers featuring gallons of milk prominently displayed and an end cap display of NY steaks for $1.50/each attention grabbing.

## STOP #2: DOLLAR TREE

Our second stop on the tour was a store tour of Dollar Tree in Tinley Park,  IL. We note the following highlights:

[^1]: **Store Appearance**: The store was in great shape featuring a racetrack format,  appropriate lighting,  and low risers which allowed very clear sightlines. The front-end of the store looked solid with an assortment of seasonal outdoor items including iced tea,  pool accessories,  condiments,  and small coolers situated at the entrance. However,  the store was approximately 17, 000 square feet,  which compared to its average build of 10, 300 and was too big,  in our view.
[^1]: **No Multi Price Points**: As opposed to the Deal$store,  the Dollar Tree store we visited sold only items for$1.00,  but the company is testing higher price points in approximately 25 stores this year (called "Oops" within the store). As a reminder,  Dollar Tree plans to open 25 new Deal$stores,  which include multi price points by the end of FY 07.
[^1]: **Build a Basket Continues as a Theme:** In order to overcome the$1 price point barrier,  Dollar Tree continue to offer its "build-a-basket" theme in which several$1 items are collected as one overall item. The latest example in the store we visited was in the wedding shower area,  which feature various items (e.g. candles,  soaps,  etc.) that a shopper could purchase with a total average ticket (or basket of) of roughly ~$11-$15.
[^1]: **Focus on End Cap Displays:** On the tour,  management spoke to a current focus in the store being centered on improving end-cap displays and highlighting top name-brand merchandise. Examples which we observed included an Arizona Iced Tea end-cap display up front,  Spiderman,  glow sticks,  and Bugles chips.

## STOP #3: DOLLAR GENERAL

The third stop on our dollar store tour was Dollar General in Hickory Hills,  IL. We note the following highlights from the store tour:

[^1]: **In-Store Experience**: The overall store appearance was lackluster and ranked the worst of the five stores visited during the day. Along these lines,  the merchandise was disorganized with many racks missing displays/pricing. In addition,  the sight lines of the store were poor with many products stacked on top of aisles and toys located around the perimeter of the store atop wall displays.
[^1]: **Pack-Away Clearance:** Director of IR,  Emma Jo Kauffman spoke to pack-away inventory (internally referred to as "alpha" sell through as roughly two thirds complete at this juncture (say$100 million left of$300 million pack-away target). Throughout the store we observed pack-away clearance,  including winter apparel at 50% off and seasonal/home items discounted at 25% off.
[^1]: **Forward Looking Strategy:** During the tour,  management spoke to three forward looking areas of focus including (1) private label expansion,  (2) reduced SKU's through pack-away clearance,  and (3) initiation of zone pricing. Although these represent longer-term (2-3 years) initiatives,  we believe they represent steps in the right direction for the company. In addition,  the company plans to focus its attention on highlighting "wow" treasure hunt items on aisle end-caps.

## STOP #4: BIG LOTS

Our fourth stop on the tour was a store tour of Big Lots in Chicago,  IL. We note the following highlights:

[^1]: **Pier 1 Closeout Deal:** A recent closeout deal,  Big Lots purchased roughly$73 million of closeout merchandise from Pier One consisting of 50% furniture items and 50% decorative accessories. The assortment of merchandise,  which was moved into stores over the Memorial Day weekend,  was located at the front entrance to the store and looked inviting with area rugs,  dressers,  desks,  end tables,  vases,  and throw pillows highlighted. Overhead signage clearly highlighted the deal as 50% off.
[^1]: **Store Appearance**: The store we visited was in good shape featuring a full furniture assortment in the back of the store,  seasonal items (gas grills,  patio furniture) situated in the center area of the store and consumables to the right.
[^1]: **Furniture**: The store we visited featured a full furniture assortment in the back of the store,  including couches,  love seats,  dressers,  sleigh beds,  and desks. Store level management commented that the Ashley brand couches for$299-$399 and Serta mattresses have been met with strong demand. As a reminder,  during 1 Q,  the furniture category (rolled out to ~ 1, 100 stores as of today) led the company with a "low double digit" Comps.
[^1]: **In-Store Signage:** The company's new in-store marketing package was rolled during 1 Q and looked much improved,  in our view. Specifically,  name brand items (i.e. Huggies diapers) were highlighted on end-cap displays with bright orange signage stating "You never know what you're going to find." In addition,  the overhead signage in the store looked good clearly identifying specific merchandise categories (i.e. Home & Décor,  Party and Stationary) creating an improved sense of organization and better shopping experience.

## STOP #5: FAMILY DOLLAR

Our fifth and final stop on the tour was a Family Dollar store in Chicago,  IL. We note the following highlights:

[^1]: **Narrowed Assortment in Apparel:** Mike Kvitko (SVP-Merchandising) spoke to the progress achieved over the past year as well as current status of apparel at Family Dollar. First,  the number of apparel SKU's has been reduced by approximately 40% year-over-year in the store with higher markdowns (40%/70% program) taken in order to clear through excess inventory. In addition,  the number of styles (per fixture) has been reduced to 12 today (from 40 a year ago),  which has improved the look of the offering. Mr. Kvitko commented that the current focus in the apparel category is on quality improvement. In addition,  with the low-end consumer more focused on necessity rather than discretionary purchases,  the company has placed an emphasis on its "climate right" apparel initiative,  which involves ensuring that the clothing appropriately fits the current weather conditions.
[^1]: **Hanes Rollout**: The Hanes brand clothing looked impressive and was prominently displayed in both the apparel area (e.g. socks,  T-shirts,  underwear) located on the back wall as well as an assortment of socks and underwear situated front and center. As a reminder,  the company rolled out the Hanes to its store base in late March.
[^1]: **Store Observations**: The store we visited was roughly 7, 800 square feet and looked solid with clear sightlines,  nice end cap displays,  appropriate lighting,  and clean aisles. The front-end of the store was well organized and featured seasonal items,  including inflatable pools,  goggles,  and baskets. In addition,  the overhead signage clearly marked and highlighted various areas of the store including food,  HBA,  and cleaning supplies.
[^1]: **Expanded Food Assortment**: On the tour,  management stated that the store's consumables area has expanded by one aisle over the past year to complement its cooler (5 doors) program. Of note,  the enhanced food assortment was rolled out to 2, 000 stores during February.
[^1]: **Corral Area to Reduce Shrink:** Located at the front of the store,  management pointed out an area which they term the "corral" and includes high shrink items,  such as batteries,  DVD's,  and miscellaneous HBA items. With a goal of continued shrink improvement,  the company has located these items closer to store level employees in order to limit theft in the store,  which we see as a positive initiative.
