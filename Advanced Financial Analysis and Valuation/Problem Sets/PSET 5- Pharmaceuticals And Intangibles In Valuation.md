# PSET 5 - Pharmaceuticals and Intangibles in Valuation

### CASE: MEDFIELD PHARMACEUTICALS (DARDEN)

Roger Lin

Please review the following materials to prepare for the case:

[^1]: Read Medfield Pharma case. Ignore the reference to Exhibit 4 in the case (we eliminated the Exhibit). You will build this forecast in the Excel template.
[^2]: Refer to the Excel "Medfield - Student Template" to complete the assignment.

Please answer the following questions for this assignment. If there are questions in the case materials, please ignore and answer only the questions below.

[^1]: Using the Excel template, create forecasts for Medfield to the year 2034. What is the value of Medfield's existing drugs and drug pipeline, ignoring the reformulation option? Use a DCF model to determine this value; discount future cash flows to the beginning of FY 2011 (or 1/1/2011) as the case is set in the first few weeks of 2011. Provide brief reasoning for how you get from NOPAT (as provided in the case) to FCF in your model.
[^1]: With the existing pipeline of drugs, Medfield has a net present value of $442 million dollars.
[^1]: Fleximat is projected to earn $644.76 over its remaining lifespan of 2 years of patent protection, followed by 3 consecutive years of 50% declines in sales.
[^2]: Lodamadal is projected to earn $220.79 million over the remaining 5 years of patent protection and 3 years of gradual obsolescence.
[^3]: Orsamorph has 14 years remaining on its patent life, and is expected to contribute $1,121.43 million in gross profits over its remaining lifespan.
[^4]: Finally, Reximet has not yet been released to the public, and thus, has a full 20 year lifespan ahead of it, followed by 3 years of declining sales. It is expected to provide $288.6 million over the course of its lifespan.
[^2]: However, I should note that this NPV is for the current value of the existing drugs, and assuming that research costs are as given in the model, even when no new drugs are being released by the market. We should expect a higher valuation if we cut out research costs since no new drugs are being researched. This model also does not account for the terminal value of the company, which would increase the NPV of the company. The $442 million dollar NPV estimate is thus likely an undercount.
[^3]: Typically, to get from NOPAT to FCF, we would add back depreciation and amortization to the NOPAT, and subtract out any capital expenditures, net changes in working capital, and proceeds from asset sales. However, we are told that "Capital expenditures were typically close to depreciation levels so that net changes in plant and equipment associated with a given product could be ignored. Similarly, net working capital tended to be very small and could be ignored." Similarly, the income statement notes that Midfield pharmaceuticals has negligible depreciation and amortization. Thus, we do not make any adjustments to the NOPAT, and simply set our FCF estimates equal to the NOPAT projections.

[^2]: What incremental financial value could Medfield create if Susan Johnson chose to reformulate Fleximat?
[^1]: Reformulating Fleximat would incur a two year R&D cost of $35 million a year beginning in 2011 and ending in 2012, as well as a $25 million per year marketing expense for 5 years, from 2011 to 2014. Weighed against these costs are the additional 8 years of 2% annual growth in sales that Fleximat could enjoy, following an initial 50% decline in sales in 2013. After these eight years pass, the drug will gradually phase out into obsolescence over three years in which sales decline by half each year. The reformulation of Fleximat would bring our NPV estimate up to $502.6 million, adding $63.5 million in additional value.

[^3]: Using Reximet's financials as an example of a typical drug, what is the value of a typical new drug? Using the cost of research for a typical drug as a starting point, what is the value of Medfield's "research advantage" in perpetuity? Assume this existing research advantage (relative to the typical firm) lasts forever, but does not grow over time.
[^1]: The NPV of the new drug is $278 million, and the NPV of research is $93.8 million. Thus, the net NPV of a new drug is $184.8 million. The PV of research by a typical pharmaceutical company is $134 million. On an annual basis, Medfield saves an estimated $10.2 million in drug research costs. The value of this research advantage is thus $120 million in perpetuity, assuming a discount rate of 8.5%.

[^4]: Does the acquisition offer price seem reasonable in light of your analyses and should Susan Johnson recommend accepting it? Please provide a brief (but precise) explanation using the results of your analyses.
	- The offer of $775 million for the company represents a significant premium over the $502.6 million NPV of the company, if we assume that the company stops producing new drugs, reformulates Fleximat and that there is no terminal value for the firm. If we assume that the firm will continue to release new drugs, then the terminal value will increase the NPV of the company significantly, which would likely imply that the offered $775 million is far too low for the true value of the company.
