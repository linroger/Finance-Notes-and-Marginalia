# Week 4 Valuing Young and High‐Growth Companies

## ADVANCED FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND VALUATION OF GLOBAL FIRMS

Today

- Difficulties of valuing young and high-growth companies
	- As in Week 3, we have to be careful about using the past
	- How are we dealing with high growth?
- Approaches to high growth and uncertainty
	- Backward induction
	- Scenario analysis
- How to value executive stock compensation (pre-recording)
- Netflix valuation (Case)
- Accounting shenanigans in young and growth companies

## CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUNG & HIGH-GROWTH COMPANIES

### Young Companies
- Limited operating history
- Negative or volatile earnings
- High uncertainty
- Limited financial data
- Rapidly evolving business models

### High-Growth Companies
- Rapid revenue growth
- High reinvestment needs
- Changing economics
- Competitive threats
- Sustainability questions

## KEY VALUATION CHALLENGES

### 1. Limited Historical Data
- Cannot rely on past patterns
- No steady-state to extrapolate
- Rapidly changing business model

### 2. Negative Cash Flows
- Current financials not representative
- High burn rates
- Investment phase

### 3. High Uncertainty
- Market size uncertainty
- Competitive dynamics
- Technology risks
- Regulatory risks

### 4. Terminal Value Dominance
- Most value in terminal period
- High sensitivity to assumptions
- Mean reversion timing

## VALUATION APPROACHES

### 1. Traditional DCF Challenges
Problems with standard DCF:
- Negative near-term cash flows
- Uncertain growth rates
- Difficult to estimate WACC
- Terminal value dominates

### 2. Backward Induction Method
- Start with mature company characteristics
- Work backward to present
- Define path to maturity
- More intuitive for high growth

Steps:
1. Project mature company metrics
2. Estimate time to maturity
3. Define transition path
4. Discount back to present

### 3. Scenario Analysis
Multiple scenarios for:
- Market size
- Market share
- Margins
- Time to profitability

Probability-weighted valuation:
- Best case
- Base case  
- Worst case
- Assign probabilities

### 4. Real Options Approach
Value growth opportunities as options:
- Market expansion options
- Product development options
- Acquisition options
- Abandonment options

## MEAN REVERSION AND COMPETITION

### Growth Rate Mean Reversion
- High growth attracts competition
- Margins compress over time
- Market share stabilizes
- Returns trend to cost of capital

### Modeling Competition
- Entry barriers
- Network effects
- Switching costs
- Economies of scale
- Brand value

## PRACTICAL FRAMEWORK

### Step 1: Define Business Model
- Revenue model
- Cost structure
- Capital requirements
- Competitive advantages

### Step 2: Market Analysis
- Total addressable market
- Growth drivers
- Competitive landscape
- Regulatory environment

### Step 3: Financial Projections
- Revenue growth path
- Margin evolution
- Investment needs
- Working capital

### Step 4: Risk Assessment
- Business risks
- Financial risks
- Market risks
- Execution risks

### Step 5: Valuation
- Multiple scenarios
- Sensitivity analysis
- Probability weighting
- Sanity checks

## NETFLIX CASE STUDY

Key Considerations:
- Subscriber growth
- Content costs
- International expansion
- Competition from Disney+, etc.
- Pricing power
- Churn rates

Valuation Approach:
1. Subscriber projections by region
2. ARPU evolution
3. Content cost modeling
4. Operating leverage
5. Terminal value assumptions

## ACCOUNTING SHENANIGANS IN GROWTH COMPANIES

### Common Issues:
1. Revenue recognition
	- Premature recognition
	- Channel stuffing
	- Round-tripping

[^2]: Expense capitalization
	- R&D capitalization
	- Customer acquisition costs
	- Software development

[^3]: Metric manipulation
	- Non-GAAP measures
	- Cohort definitions
	- Churn calculations

### Red Flags:
- Diverging metrics
- Changing definitions
- Aggressive accounting
- Weak internal controls
- High employee turnover

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

[^1]: Traditional valuation methods often inadequate
[^2]: Scenario analysis is crucial
[^3]: Mean reversion is powerful force
[^4]: Terminal value assumptions critical
[^5]: Watch for accounting red flags
[^6]: Consider competitive dynamics
[^7]: Value growth options appropriately

## SUMMARY

Valuing young and high-growth companies requires adapting traditional methods to handle high uncertainty, negative cash flows, and limited history. The key is to think about the company's potential mature state and the path to get there, while being realistic about competition and mean reversion. Multiple scenarios and probability weighting help capture the wide range of possible outcomes.
