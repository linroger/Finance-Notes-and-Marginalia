## MARKET EFFICIENCY & FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS

## MARKET EFFICIENCY

- What is [[Chapter 12 Market Efficiency|market efficiency]]?
	  - Stock prices rapidly adjust to new information
	  - New information is fully reflected in prices ⇒ trading on this information does not offer an abnormal rate of return
	  - Efficiency implies that capital markets become a fair game
	  - Only new information should move prices ⇒ prices follow a [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|random walk]]
- [[Chapter 12 Market Efficiency|Market efficiency]] is a relative concept
	  - Defined relative to an information set
- If markets are (semi-strong form) efficient,  then all publicly available information is reflected in price
	  - Does it make sense to conduct [[Week 1 Introduction to Financial Analysis|fundamental analysis]] based on publicly available information?

## PARADOX OF EFFICIENT MARKETS

- When information acquisition is costly,  we have a paradox
	  - If markets are efficient and reflect all publicly available information,  then why should you engage in costly information acquisition?
	  - But if nobody engages in this activity,  how do markets become efficient in the first place?
- Efficiency is not an equilibrium when information is costly
	  - There is always some mispricing
	 - Higher [[Assets|returns]] are compensation for costly info acquisition and [[Week 1 [[Squam Lake Group Introduction|Introduction]] to [[BMW Valuation|Financial Analysis]]|[[BMW Valuation|financial analysis]]]]
- Hedge fund industry illustrates:
	  - Gains from info acquisition & analysis can be substantial
		 - Strong incentives to exploit or [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]] market inefficiencies or mispricing
		  - Many anomalies that were identified are no longer profitable

## ROLE OF ARBITRAGE

- [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|Arbitrage]] limits the inefficiencies in markets
		  - But transaction costs and institutional constraints limit [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]]
- [[Purpose and Structure of Financial Markets 1|Arbitrage strategies]] may not be entirely risk-free in which case the return is
partly compensation for risk
 - For instance,  [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] plays an important role for [[Purpose and Structure of Financial Markets 1|arbitrage strategies]] and may be missing in extreme situations
		  - Examples showing that sophisticated strategies can have significant risks:
				- [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|[[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|Long Term Capital Management]]]] (Asian crisis)
				- [[Basis Trade Explainer|Hedge funds]] and their quantitative strategies in August 2007
- Recent decline in the number of (new) [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] shows that the industry is very competitive

## EVIDENCE ON MARKET EFFICIENCY

- Lots of evidence that markets are competitive (see Koller et al.,  Chapter 5)
	  - Strong link between prices and [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|fundamentals]] (growth,  ROIC and cost of capital),  especially in the long-run
	  - Market's reaction to news events is almost instantaneous
		- Mutual funds are generally unable to outperform indices consistently
		- [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|Pricing]] of financial information is quite sophisticated
- Yet,  there are:
	  - Bubbles and [[Hedge Fund Strategies|stock market]] anomalies
		- Growing evidence that behavioral [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|biases]] in human decision making can survive
and matter in markets (see Additional Readings on Canvas)
- Answers by IGM Economic Experts Panel reflect both aspects
	- - Question 1: Strong consensus on (non-)predictability of stock prices
	- Question 2: Majority of the panel does not think that prices during Dot Com bubble were based on [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|fundamentals]] alone

### BAXTER 10-K IN 2008 AND 2009 IN COMPARISON

 ![500](18d7ddbdc7844f507d1bd64cb800d572.png)

Note that the 10-K

released in Feb 2010 is the one for fiscal 2009

## EXAMPLE: LAZY PRICES (COHEN ET AL. JF 2020)

- Study analyzes changes in the text of firms' 10-K filings
		  - Shows that Baxter example is not an isolated case
- Investors seem to miss 10-K changes
		  - Strategy going long in "Non-Changers" and short in "Changers" yields
alpha of 7%
		  - Even larger when using changes in the risk-factor discussion in the 10-K specifically
		  - Results are across all stocks (even large ones)
- What do you predict will happen to this result?
		  - Ke,  Kelly and Xiu: "Predicting [[Assets|returns]] with text data"
- What do we learn?
		  - There is a lot of relevant info in 10-K that is not necessarily processed
		  - Paper suggests differential "laziness"
				- Earnings announcements and most accounting numbers are quickly processed - Text is harder to process than numbers - For text,  there is not the same comparison with prior year

## MY TAKE

- Markets price (long-run) [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|fundamentals]]
		  - Aggregate an enormous amount of information
- Even when stocks are priced correctly on average,  there is a standard error and hence some mispricing of individual stocks at certain times
- Degree to which price reflects all publicly available information can differ across stocks and time
		  - Info environment of a stock matters - Ability to [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]] differs across stocks
				- Many anomalies are concentrated in small stocks
- Also,  the market seems to be particularly good at relative [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]]
		  - But it can be off with respect to absolute (or fundamental) value
		  - This is what happens in a bubble

## BOTTOM LINE

- [[Week 1 Introduction to Financial Analysis|Fundamental analysis]] can be worthwhile because prices can and do deviate from [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|fundamentals]]
- [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|Arbitrage]] fails at times and bubbles arise
- But at the same time,  there are always strong forces to exploit opportunities in the market
- You can use the same lens to understand recent trends in markets

## FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS AND RECENT TRENDS RECENT TRENDS

- What about the trend towards passive investments and ETFs?
		  - Stocks in the indices still need to be valued and priced (by somebody)
			- Remember the paradox of efficient markets
			- Less crowded field for [[Week 1 Introduction to Financial Analysis|fundamental analysis]] should imply larger opportunities
		  - On top of that,  benchmark pressures can exacerbate trends or momentum (and hence mispricing)
- What about the rise quant strategies? - What about machine learning and alternative data?

## QUANT INVESTING

- Fundamental approach
		  - Detailed analysis of financial statements and other data
			 - Determine "fundamental" value using valuation model
			  - [[Week 1 Introduction to Financial Analysis|Fundamental analysis]] is quantitative
- Quantitative approach uses "models" and "signals"
		  - Typically conducted for large samples
			- Most of the financial statement information is taken as given
			 - Most models attempt to predict future (or abnormal) [[Assets|returns]]
- Quant approach and model building requires back testing
		  - Overfitting is a major risk
			- [[Understanding the Term Structure of Interest Rates|Time-varying risk premia]] and "shifting" [[Financial Mathematics Course|asset pricing models]] are major challenges
- For short horizons,  quant strategies and machines have largely replaced people

## "QUANTAMENTAL" APPROACH & MACHINE LEARNING

- Combines fundamental and quant
		  - Incorporate quantitative approaches as well as alternative or big data
		  - Fundamental approach can [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products|leverage]] the machine
- "Lazy Prices" example fits this description
		  - Easy to see more sophisticated applications using ML
- Fundamental concepts are still relevant for quant strategies & ML
		  - Stock return data are very noisy
		  - Adding structure can help with prediction and causality
		  - Alternative: Use ML to predict company [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|fundamentals]]

## RISE OF ALTERNATIVE DATA

 ![500](46f5e9fc7f2f53a14ec51e18d7eddaaa.png)

- In search of a true info advantage
		  - Location,  credit card,  social media data,  etc.
		  - Used to predict sales or for eventdriven strategies (e.g.,  around EA)
		  - Data are often messy
				- Use of ML for processing data
- My [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|bottom line]] for now:
		  - [[Week 1 Introduction to Financial Analysis|Fundamental analysis]] and active strategies continue to be relevant
		  - Especially for smaller,  less liquid stocks,  and over longer [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] horizons
			- Sloan article that is assigned for this week illustrates this (two case studies)
