# Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting

## FUNDAMENTALS OF FORECASTING

## INSIDE VS. OUTSIDE VIEW

### COMMON BEHAVIORAL BIASES AND MISTAKES

- Humans exhibit a large number of biases in their decision making and forecasting
	- Rely heavily on mental shortcuts
- Forecasting is central to fundamental analysis and valuation
	- Estimating the intrinsic value of a company requires longer-term forecasting
		- Here is where biases matter the most
	- Event-driven strategies forecast near-term EPS or events
		- No fundamental analysis necessary
- Kahneman and Tversky highlighted two biases that are particularly relevant for forecasting:
	1. Representativeness Heuristic
	2. Availability Heuristic

### REPRESENTATIVENESS HEURISTIC

- The representativeness heuristic: assessing the probability of an event based on the degree to which it resembles other events
- People tend to:
	- Overestimate the probability of events that are similar to recent or memorable experiences
	- Underestimate the probability of events that differ from their expectations
- Example: Hot hand in basketball
	- Players who make several shots in a row are not more likely to make the next shot
	- But people believe they are "hot" and will continue succeeding

### AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC  

- The availability heuristic: judging the probability of an event by how easily examples come to mind
- Events that are more vivid, recent, or emotionally charged are easier to recall
- This leads to overestimating their probability
- Example: Fear of flying vs. driving
	- Plane crashes get extensive media coverage
	- Car accidents are more common but less memorable
	- People overestimate the risk of flying relative to driving

### OTHER COMMON BIASES IN FORECASTING

[^1]: **Confirmation Bias**
	- Seeking information that confirms existing beliefs
	- Ignoring or discounting contradictory evidence
	- Particularly dangerous in financial analysis

[^2]: **Anchoring and Adjustment**
	- Over-relying on the first piece of information encountered
	- Insufficient adjustment from initial estimates
	- Common in valuation multiples and target prices

[^3]: **Overconfidence**
	- Overestimating one's ability to predict outcomes
	- Underestimating uncertainty and ranges
	- More pronounced for difficult forecasts

### THE INSIDE VIEW

The inside view:
- Focuses on the specifics of the case at hand
- Considers unique features and circumstances
- Relies on detailed knowledge of the company/situation
- Often leads to overly optimistic forecasts

### THE OUTSIDE VIEW (BASE RATES)

The outside view:
- Looks at similar cases and their outcomes
- Uses statistical base rates
- Considers the reference class
- Generally more accurate for forecasting

### EXAMPLE: NEW PRODUCT LAUNCH FORECAST

**Inside View:**
- "Our product is revolutionary"
- "Our team is exceptional"
- "Our marketing strategy is unique"
- Forecast: 50% market share in 2 years

**Outside View:**
- Historical success rate of new products: 20%
- Average market share after 2 years: 5-10%
- Time to profitability: 3-5 years
- Adjusted forecast: 5-15% market share

### MEAN REVERSION

- Most financial metrics tend to revert to long-term averages
- High growth rates → slower growth
- High margins → industry average margins
- High ROE → cost of capital

### INDUSTRY PROFIT MARGINS

Example: Industry margins tend to converge over time
- Initially high margins attract competition
- Competition drives prices down
- Margins converge to industry average
- Consider competitive dynamics in forecasts

### ANALYST FORECASTS AND BIASES

Common patterns in analyst forecasts:
[^1]: Over-optimism in long-term forecasts
[^2]: Herding behavior
[^3]: Reluctance to deviate from consensus
[^4]: Slow reaction to new information

### BEST PRACTICES FOR FORECASTING

[^1]: **Start with the outside view**
	- What are the base rates?
	- What happened to similar companies?
	- What are industry averages?

[^2]: **Adjust for inside view**
	- What makes this case unique?
	- Are there structural advantages?
	- Is there evidence of sustainability?

[^3]: **Consider multiple scenarios**
	- Best case / Base case / Worst case
	- Assign probabilities
	- Stress test assumptions

[^4]: **Document assumptions**
	- Make them explicit
	- Test sensitivity
	- Update as new information arrives

[^5]: **Learn from errors**
	- Track forecast accuracy
	- Identify systematic biases
	- Calibrate future forecasts

### CONCLUSION

- Good forecasting requires balancing inside and outside views
- Be aware of behavioral biases
- Use base rates as anchors
- Consider mean reversion
- Document and test assumptions
- Learn from forecast errors
