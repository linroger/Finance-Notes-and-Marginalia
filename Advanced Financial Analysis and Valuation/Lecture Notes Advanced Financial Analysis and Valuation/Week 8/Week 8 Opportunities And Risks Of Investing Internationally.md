# OPPORTUNITIES OF INVESTING ABROAD: FDI AND M&A
## IMPORTANCE OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENTS
 - [Introduction to Globalization](Chapter%201-[[Chapter%201-Introduction%20to%20Globalization)|Globalization]] of markets
	‒ Financial integration through liberalization of capital markets
	‒ [Economic integration](../../../International%20Finance/Globalization/Chapter%201-Introduction%20to%20Globalization.md) through increased trade
 - Increased integration has led to a dramatic increase in cross-border M&A, particularly with emerging markets
	 ‒ Firms become more international in their operations
	 ‒ Best opportunities have often been abroad
	‒ Increasingly, [emerging market companies](.md) are engaging in cross-border M&A too

## EMERGING MARKET COMPANIES
 - At the start of the 90s, companies from U.S., Western Europe and Japan represented the bulk of the [global economy](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Fewer%20Or%20Even%20None.md)
 - This has fundamentally changed over the past 25 years
	‒ [Emerging market companies](.md) are among the largest globally
	‒ Weight of EMs in MSCI All Country index has increased
	 - From 2% in 1988 to 22% in 2016 (from 24 countries)
	‒ Increasing investor demand for these companies
 - Key issues when analyzing emerging market firms:
	‒ [Currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) risks and exchange rate volatility
	‒ Country and institutional risks
	‒ Information quality, corporate governance, ownership concentration
 - Basic ingredients for valuing [emerging market companies](.md) are the same
	‒ But many practical issues

# OPPORTUNITIES OF INVESTING ABROAD
## WHY INVEST ABROAD?
 - Commonly cited benefits from [investing abroad](.md) (as a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) investor)
	‒ Higher [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) than in the U.S.
	‒ [Diversification benefits](.md)
 - Domestic multinationals have significant international exposure
	‒ But offer inefficient diversification compared to international [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)
 - Purely domestic [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) can be viewed as an "active" deviation from a global benchmark
 - Domestic strategy can have significant asset-selection risks as well as industry and style tilts (relative to global benchmark), especially true for
	 - Domestic large cap strategy
	 - In countries with small domestic [equity markets](../../../Financial%20Engineering/An%20Introduction%20to%20Equity%20Markets.md)

## EMERGING MARKET VS. DEVELOPED MARKET RETURNS

 ![500](0a82581cab5ecb6fd9a2f889d9ff8ee0.png)

 - Emerging markets have historically outperformed developed markets
	‒ But they also are riskier  - see volatility in chart above
 - U.S. has offered a higher return for a given level of risk and hence was more attractive standalone [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) than most foreign markets
 -     ‒ This does not imply that foreign markets are not attractive in combination with U.S. stocks

## DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS

 - Benefits from foreign equity investments are well documented
	‒ Higher return and/or lower risk
 - Originally, investors started with domestic-international allocation
	‒ Focused on developed markets and larger cap stocks (e.g., MSCI EAFE index)

Figure 2: Going Abroad Has Provided Diversification
 ![500](aa03ea8c4c0d5fb429715f53ece7498d.png)
Even a small fraction of foreign [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in developed economies dominated a 100% US [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)

## DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS FROM EMERGING MARKETS (EMS)
 - EMs often viewed as appealing due to lower correlations with the U.S. as compared to other developed markets (DMs)
	‒ Additional [diversification benefits](.md) relative to DMs
 - In 70s and 80s, EM correlations with U.S. were very low
	‒ Still fairly low in 90s
 - In last two decades, correlations with U.S. have increased considerably
	‒ True for both EMs and DMs
	‒ Effect of market liberalizations, financial integration, macroeconomic coordination, and globalization
 - What does this mean for [diversification benefits](.md)?

## CHANGES IN CORRELATIONS OVER TIME

## CHANGES IN CORRELATIONS OVER TIME (CONT.)

 ![500](ea38bf25f24d31c0efc9cf370f7f858e.png)

## IS IT STILL WORTH IT (GIVEN INCREASE IN CORRELATIONS)?
 - Do we care about a low correlation per se?
	‒ We would not use a lottery for diversification (even though it is uncorrelated with our [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) return)
 - [Diversification benefits](.md) are not just determined by the correlations
	‒ They also depend on expected [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) and volatility
 - It is possible that [diversification benefits](.md) and the Sharpe ratio increase, despite the fact that correlations increase
	‒ Not only correlations, but also [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) and risk in EMs have changed over time
 ![500](72e49dcc3283b9b7f1691dbbbb05c9f4.png)
## TREND TOWARDS INVESTMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL SMALL CAPS
 - These investments are often motivated by lower correlations of small caps
 ![500](4d76ef317684ed981466826dd9bdd8ee.png)
## TREND TOWARDS INTERNATIONAL SMALL CAPS (CONT.)
 - Conceptually, it makes sense that multinationals and large global players in EMs offer less diversification
	‒ But again, we also need to consider expected [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) and volatility
 - While foreign small caps can be attractive from a diversification or growth perspective, they tend to have larger risks and pose challenges in terms of
	‒ Information
	‒ Corporate governance
	‒ [Liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md)
 - These risks matter especially for M&A

## WHAT ABOUT CRISES?
 - [Diversification benefits](.md) and optimal allocations change through time
	‒ See earlier graphs
 - During financial or corona crisis, there was no place to hide (in equities)
	‒ See next slide
 - Do we really believe that we can hedge against a major [financial crisis](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) (rocking banks in developed countries) by buying shares in China (or elsewhere)?
	 ‒ China is highly dependent on the U.S. consumer
	‒ [Financial markets](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) have never been more interconnected
	‒ This risk is better addressed with [Asset Allocation](Lecture%202-%20[[Lecture%202-%20Asset%20Allocation%20with%20Multiple%20Risky%20Assets) with [Multiple Risky Assets](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%202-%20Asset%20Allocation%20with%20Multiple%20Risky%20Assets.md)|[asset allocation](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%202-%20Asset%20Allocation%20with%20Multiple%20Risky%20Assets.md)]] (across classes of assets)
 - So not really an argument against diversification

## CORRELATIONS WITH U.S. RETURNS IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS

 ![500](63ef2bab6295c5af5492a5915d7a1787.png)

 - Similar results could be shown for other crises
 - Despite widespread negative [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md), there are substantial differences in how EMs fare during crises
 - Crisis performance often depends on countries' legal and political institutions
## TO WHAT EXTENT DO WE INVEST ABROAD?
 - In sum, case for [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in EMs as part of an equity [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) remains strong
	‒ EMs offer substantial [diversification benefits](.md)
	‒ EMs provide interesting [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) opportunities
 - Nevertheless, there is significant home bias around the world
	‒ Traditional [Asset Allocation](Lecture%202-%20[[Lecture%202-%20Asset%20Allocation%20with%20Multiple%20Risky%20Assets) with [Multiple Risky Assets](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%202-%20Asset%20Allocation%20with%20Multiple%20Risky%20Assets.md)|[asset allocation](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%202-%20Asset%20Allocation%20with%20Multiple%20Risky%20Assets.md)]]: Domestic/international is still common
 - Traditional explanation: Barriers to foreign [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), e.g.,
	‒ Capital and [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) controls;
	‒ Transaction and trading costs
	‒ Different accounting standards
 - Many traditional barriers to foreign [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) have decreased over time:
	‒ Adoption of [international accounting](../Week%209/Week%209-Information%20Risks%20and%20(International)%20Accounting%20Differences,%20Platform%20Businesses.md) standards (IFRS)
	‒ Financial liberalizations in many countries
 - However, home bias has not declined much, given the decline in barriers
	‒ Barriers and transaction costs alone cannot explain home bias

## HOME BIAS IN U.S. INVESTORS' PORTFOLIOS

 ![500](4d252552db9154a107d814d63c4a70d6.png)

## HOME BIAS IN U.S. INVESTORS' PORTFOLIOS (CONT.)

 ![500](a259b76f2205e9b6bebc185dd4426d39.png)

- HOME BIAS HAS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGED FROM 1994 TO 2004

## NON -TRADITIONAL REASONS FOR HOME BIAS
 - Behavioral and cultural [biases](../Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md) (e.g., familiarity)
 - Concentrated ownership around the world
	‒ Home bias is much smaller once we adjust for availability of shares (free float)
 - What countries and which foreign stocks do U.S. investors shy away from? (e.g., Leuz et al., RFS 2009)
	‒ U.S. investors invest less in countries with poor institutions and firms where the managers and their families have high levels of control
	‒ Result is particularly pronounced for firms with poor info flows
 - Information and governance problems can explain a good deal of home bias
	‒ Information and governance explanations have different implications than behavioral or cultural [biases](../Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md)
	‒ There can be good reasons why investors put less money in certain foreign markets

# INTERNATIONAL RISKS
## INTERNATIONAL RISKS
 - [International investments](../../../International%20Finance/Globalization/Chapter%201-Introduction%20to%20Globalization.md) have a broad range of risks
	‒ "Classic" international risks: [Currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) and macroeconomic risks
 - But there are other issues to consider
	‒ Poor outside investor and legal protection
	 ‒ Corporate governance and expropriation by controlling insiders
	‒ Transparency and information risks
	‒ Corruption and political risk (e.g., expropriation by government)
 - These factors matter particularly in financial crises
	‒ They can explain crisis [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) (e.g., Asian crisis)
	‒ [Market liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Trading%20and%20Liquidity.md) and ability to trade is closely linked to transparency
	‒ Transaction costs (in particular price impact)
 - Lecture will cover a number of these risks

# MEASURING INTERNATIONAL RISKS
## MEASURING INTERNATIONAL AND COUNTRY RISKS
 - There are many useful sources
	‒ Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)
	‒ His Economics and [Country Risk](../../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke-Chapter%2015%20&%20Chapter%2016.md)
	‒ Institutional Investor Country Credit Ratings (IICCR)
	‒ International [Country Risk](../../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke-Chapter%2015%20&%20Chapter%2016.md) Guide (ICRG)
 - Measuring institutional quality is a major effort at the World Bank and IMF
	‒ Worldwide Governance Indicators & Doing Business Reports
 - Measuring political risks is still an art rather than a science
 - - Scores often map into sovereign spreads
	‒ Priced in cost of capital
 - Scores can beuseful to quantify country differences as well as the  components of [country risk](../../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke-Chapter%2015%20&%20Chapter%2016.md)

| Very High Risk  | 0.0-49.5                |
| High Risk       | 50.0-59.5               |
| Moderate Risk   | 60.0-69.5               |
| Low Risk        | 70.0-84.5               |

# INTERNATIONAL COST OF CAPITAL IN PRACTICE
## HOW DO WE CAPTURE INTERNATIONAL RISKS?
 - Cost of capital is frequently used to account for international risks
	‒ These factors are generally not captured in and compensated w/ beta
	‒ Common to make adjustments to cost of capital
 - How should we determine the cost of capital?
	‒ Lecture will cover some alternatives
 - What do practitioners do?
	‒ Most practitioners start with CAPM (see Readings for Week 8)
	‒ Make adjustments to the CAPM to account for country risks
 - Common to use sovereign spreads over U.S. treasury yields to capture country risks: e.g.,
	‒ $$-\mathrm{CoC=R_f^{US}+Beta^*(U.S.~Equity~Premium)+SS}$$
## WHAT DO PRACTITIONERS DO?
 - There are many different models and proposed approaches
	‒ Different values for Exxon Mobile [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in Argentina (in 2005):
 ![500](0555ef14899a81b739ae1ad30cf57de7.png)
 - Salomon Smith Barney survey (2002):
"Unfortunately, the only real consensus is that there is no consensus on how to estimate the international cost of capital. Almost every academic or practitioner has a different recommendation."
