# Opportunities of Investing Abroad: FDI and M&A

## Importance of International Investments

- Globalization of markets
  - Financial integration through liberalization of capital markets
  - Economic integration through increased trade
- Increased integration has led to a dramatic increase in cross-border M&A, particularly with emerging markets
  - Firms become more international in their operations
  - Best opportunities have often been abroad
  - Increasingly, emerging market companies are engaging in cross-border M&A too

!Cross-border M&A trends

## Cross-Border M&A Accounts for 25-30%

!Cross-border M&A percentage

## Emerging Market Companies

- At the start of the 90s, companies from U.S., Western Europe and Japan represented the bulk of the global economy
- This has fundamentally changed over the past 25 years
  - Emerging market companies are among the largest globally
  - Weight of EMs in MSCI All Country index has increased
    - From 2% in 1988 to 22% in 2016 (from 24 countries)
  - Increasing investor demand for these companies
- Key issues when analyzing emerging market firms:
  - Currency risks and exchange rate volatility
  - Country and institutional risks
  - Information quality, corporate governance, ownership concentration
- Basic ingredients for valuing emerging market companies are the same
  - But many practical issues

# Opportunities of Investing Abroad

## Why Invest Abroad?

- Commonly cited benefits from investing abroad (as a portfolio investor)
  - Higher returns than in the U.S.
  - Diversification benefits
- Domestic multinationals have significant international exposure
  - But offer inefficient diversification compared to international portfolio
- Purely domestic portfolio can be viewed as an "active" deviation from a global benchmark
- Domestic strategy can have significant asset-selection risks as well as industry and style tilts (relative to global benchmark), especially true for
  - Domestic large cap strategy
  - In countries with small domestic equity markets

## Diversification Illustrated Starting from UK Benchmark

## Emerging Market vs. Developed Market Returns

!EM vs DM returns comparison

- Emerging markets have historically outperformed developed markets
  - But they also are riskier - see volatility in chart above
- U.S. has offered a higher return for a given level of risk and hence was more attractive standalone investment than most foreign markets
  - This does not imply that foreign markets are not attractive in combination with U.S. stocks

## Diversification Benefits

- Benefits from foreign equity investments are well documented
  - Higher return and/or lower risk
- Originally, investors started with domestic-international allocation
  - Focused on developed markets and larger cap stocks (e.g., MSCI EAFE index)

Figure 2: Going Abroad Has Provided Diversification

!Diversification benefits chart

Even a small fraction of foreign investment in developed economies dominated a 100% US portfolio

## Diversification Benefits from Emerging Markets (EMs)

- EMs often viewed as appealing due to lower correlations with the U.S. as compared to other developed markets (DMs)
  - Additional diversification benefits relative to DMs
- In 70s and 80s, EM correlations with U.S. were very low
  - Still fairly low in 90s
- In last two decades, correlations with U.S. have increased considerably
  - True for both EMs and DMs
  - Effect of market liberalizations, financial integration, macroeconomic coordination, and globalization
- What does this mean for diversification benefits?

## Changes in Correlations Over Time

!Additional correlation data

## Is It Still Worth It (Given Increase in Correlations)?

- Do we care about a low correlation per se?
  - We would not use a lottery for diversification (even though it is uncorrelated with our portfolio return)
- Diversification benefits are not just determined by the correlations
  - They also depend on expected returns and volatility
- It is possible that diversification benefits and the Sharpe ratio increase, despite the fact that correlations increase
  - Not only correlations, but also returns and risk in EMs have changed over time

!Returns and correlations relationship

## Trend Towards Investments in International Small Caps

- These investments are often motivated by lower correlations of small caps

!International small caps correlations

## Trend Towards International Small Caps (Continued)

- Conceptually, it makes sense that multinationals and large global players in EMs offer less diversification
  - But again, we also need to consider expected returns and volatility
- While foreign small caps can be attractive from a diversification or growth perspective, they tend to have larger risks and pose challenges in terms of
  - Information
  - Corporate governance
  - Liquidity
- These risks matter especially for M&A

## What About Crises?

- Diversification benefits and optimal allocations change through time
  - See earlier graphs
- During financial or corona crisis, there was no place to hide (in equities)
  - See next slide
- Do we really believe that we can hedge against a major financial crisis (rocking banks in developed countries) by buying shares in China (or elsewhere)?
  - China is highly dependent on the U.S. consumer
  - Financial markets have never been more interconnected
  - This risk is better addressed with asset allocation (across classes of assets)
- So not really an argument against diversification

## Correlations with U.S. Returns in the Financial Crisis

!Crisis correlations

- Similar results could be shown for other crises
- Despite widespread negative returns, there are substantial differences in how EMs fare during crises
- Crisis performance often depends on countries' legal and political institutions

## To What Extent Do We Invest Abroad?

- In sum, case for investment in EMs as part of an equity portfolio remains strong
  - EMs offer substantial diversification benefits
  - EMs provide interesting investment opportunities
- Nevertheless, there is significant home bias around the world
  - Traditional asset allocation: Domestic/international is still common
- Traditional explanation: Barriers to foreign investment, e.g.,
  - Capital and currency controls
  - Transaction and trading costs
  - Different accounting standards
- Many traditional barriers to foreign investment have decreased over time:
  - Adoption of international accounting standards (IFRS)
  - Financial liberalizations in many countries
- However, home bias has not declined much, given the decline in barriers
  - Barriers and transaction costs alone cannot explain home bias

## Home Bias in U.S. Investors' Portfolios

!Home bias in US portfolios

*Kho et al. / Journal of Accounting Research, Vol. 47 No. 2 May 2009*

## Home Bias in U.S. Investors' Portfolios (Continued)

!Home bias continued

HOME BIAS HAS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGED FROM 1994 TO 2004

## Non-Traditional Reasons for Home Bias

- Behavioral and cultural biases (e.g., familiarity)
- Concentrated ownership around the world
  - Home bias is much smaller once we adjust for availability of shares (free float)
- What countries and which foreign stocks do U.S. investors shy away from? (e.g., Leuz et al., RFS 2009)
  - U.S. investors invest less in countries with poor institutions and firms where the managers and their families have high levels of control
  - Result is particularly pronounced for firms with poor info flows
- Information and governance problems can explain a good deal of home bias
  - Information and governance explanations have different implications than behavioral or cultural biases
  - There can be good reasons why investors put less money in certain foreign markets

# International Risks

## International Risks

- International investments have a broad range of risks
  - "Classic" international risks: Currency and macroeconomic risks
- But there are other issues to consider
  - Poor outside investor and legal protection
  - Corporate governance and expropriation by controlling insiders
  - Transparency and information risks
  - Corruption and political risk (e.g., expropriation by government)
- These factors matter particularly in financial crises
  - They can explain crisis returns (e.g., Asian crisis)
  - Market liquidity and ability to trade is closely linked to transparency
  - Transaction costs (in particular price impact)
- Lecture will cover a number of these risks

# Measuring International Risks

## Measuring International and Country Risks

- There are many useful sources
  - Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)
  - IHS Economics and Country Risk
  - Institutional Investor Country Credit Ratings (IICCR)
  - International Country Risk Guide (ICRG)
- Measuring institutional quality is a major effort at the World Bank and IMF
  - Worldwide Governance Indicators & Doing Business Reports
- Measuring political risks is still an art rather than a science
- Scores often map into sovereign spreads
  - Priced in cost of capital
- Scores can be useful to quantify country differences as well as the components of country risk

## International Country Risk Guide (ICRG): Risk Categories

 | Risk Category | Composite Score Range | 
 | ----------------- | ------------------------- | 
 | Very High Risk | 0.0-49.5 | 
 | High Risk | 50.0-59.5 | 
 | Moderate Risk | 60.0-69.5 | 
 | Low Risk | 70.0-84.5 | 
 | Very Low Risk | 85.0-100.0 |

# International Cost of Capital in Practice

## How Do We Capture International Risks?

- Cost of capital is frequently used to account for international risks
  - These factors are generally not captured in and compensated w/ beta
  - Common to make adjustments to cost of capital
- How should we determine the cost of capital?
  - Lecture will cover some alternatives
- What do practitioners do?
  - Most practitioners start with CAPM (see Readings for Week 8)
  - Make adjustments to the CAPM to account for country risks
- Common to use sovereign spreads over U.S. treasury yields to capture country risks: e.g.,

$$\text{CoC} = R_f^{US} + \beta \times \text{U.S. Equity Premium} + \text{SS}$$

## What Do Practitioners Do?

- There are many different models and proposed approaches
  - Different values for Exxon Mobile investment in Argentina (in 2005):

!Different valuation models comparison

- Salomon Smith Barney survey (2002):
"Unfortunately, the only real consensus is that there is no consensus on how to estimate the international cost of capital. Almost every academic or practitioner has a different recommendation."
