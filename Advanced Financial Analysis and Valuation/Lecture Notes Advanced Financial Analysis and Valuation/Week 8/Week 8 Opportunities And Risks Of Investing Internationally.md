# OPPORTUNITIES OF INVESTING ABROAD: FDI AND M&A
## IMPORTANCE OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENTS
 - [[Chapter 1-[[Chapter 1-Introduction to Globalization|Introduction to Globalization]]|Globalization]] of markets
	‒ Financial integration through liberalization of capital markets
	‒ [[Chapter 1-Introduction to Globalization|Economic integration]] through increased trade
 - Increased integration has led to a dramatic increase in cross-border M&A, particularly with emerging markets
	 ‒ Firms become more international in their operations
	 ‒ Best opportunities have often been abroad
	‒ Increasingly, [[Week 8 Opportunities And Risks Of Investing Internationally|emerging market companies]] are engaging in cross-border M&A too

## EMERGING MARKET COMPANIES
 - At the start of the 90s, companies from U.S., Western Europe and Japan represented the bulk of the [[The Economist Fewer Or Even None|global economy]]
 - This has fundamentally changed over the past 25 years
	‒ [[Week 8 Opportunities And Risks Of Investing Internationally|Emerging market companies]] are among the largest globally
	‒ Weight of EMs in MSCI All Country index has increased
	 - From 2% in 1988 to 22% in 2016 (from 24 countries)
	‒ Increasing investor demand for these companies
 - Key issues when analyzing emerging market firms:
	‒ [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] risks and exchange rate volatility
	‒ Country and institutional risks
	‒ Information quality, corporate governance, ownership concentration
 - Basic ingredients for valuing [[Week 8 Opportunities And Risks Of Investing Internationally|emerging market companies]] are the same
	‒ But many practical issues

# OPPORTUNITIES OF INVESTING ABROAD
## WHY INVEST ABROAD?
 - Commonly cited benefits from [[Week 8 Opportunities And Risks Of Investing Internationally|investing abroad]] (as a [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] investor)
	‒ Higher [[Assets|returns]] than in the U.S.
	‒ [[Week 8 Opportunities And Risks Of Investing Internationally|Diversification benefits]]
 - Domestic multinationals have significant international exposure
	‒ But offer inefficient diversification compared to international [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]]
 - Purely domestic [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] can be viewed as an "active" deviation from a global benchmark
 - Domestic strategy can have significant asset-selection risks as well as industry and style tilts (relative to global benchmark), especially true for
	 - Domestic large cap strategy
	 - In countries with small domestic [[An Introduction to Equity Markets|equity markets]]

## EMERGING MARKET VS. DEVELOPED MARKET RETURNS

 ![500](0a82581cab5ecb6fd9a2f889d9ff8ee0.png)

 - Emerging markets have historically outperformed developed markets
	‒ But they also are riskier  - see volatility in chart above
 - U.S. has offered a higher return for a given level of risk and hence was more attractive standalone [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] than most foreign markets
 -     ‒ This does not imply that foreign markets are not attractive in combination with U.S. stocks

## DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS

 - Benefits from foreign equity investments are well documented
	‒ Higher return and/or lower risk
 - Originally, investors started with domestic-international allocation
	‒ Focused on developed markets and larger cap stocks (e.g., MSCI EAFE index)

Figure 2: Going Abroad Has Provided Diversification
 ![500](aa03ea8c4c0d5fb429715f53ece7498d.png)
Even a small fraction of foreign [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] in developed economies dominated a 100% US [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]]

## DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS FROM EMERGING MARKETS (EMS)
 - EMs often viewed as appealing due to lower correlations with the U.S. as compared to other developed markets (DMs)
	‒ Additional [[Week 8 Opportunities And Risks Of Investing Internationally|diversification benefits]] relative to DMs
 - In 70s and 80s, EM correlations with U.S. were very low
	‒ Still fairly low in 90s
 - In last two decades, correlations with U.S. have increased considerably
	‒ True for both EMs and DMs
	‒ Effect of market liberalizations, financial integration, macroeconomic coordination, and globalization
 - What does this mean for [[Week 8 Opportunities And Risks Of Investing Internationally|diversification benefits]]?

## CHANGES IN CORRELATIONS OVER TIME

## CHANGES IN CORRELATIONS OVER TIME (CONT.)

 ![500](ea38bf25f24d31c0efc9cf370f7f858e.png)

## IS IT STILL WORTH IT (GIVEN INCREASE IN CORRELATIONS)?
 - Do we care about a low correlation per se?
	‒ We would not use a lottery for diversification (even though it is uncorrelated with our [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] return)
 - [[Week 8 Opportunities And Risks Of Investing Internationally|Diversification benefits]] are not just determined by the correlations
	‒ They also depend on expected [[Assets|returns]] and volatility
 - It is possible that [[Week 8 Opportunities And Risks Of Investing Internationally|diversification benefits]] and the Sharpe ratio increase, despite the fact that correlations increase
	‒ Not only correlations, but also [[Assets|returns]] and risk in EMs have changed over time
 ![500](72e49dcc3283b9b7f1691dbbbb05c9f4.png)
## TREND TOWARDS INVESTMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL SMALL CAPS
 - These investments are often motivated by lower correlations of small caps
 ![500](4d76ef317684ed981466826dd9bdd8ee.png)
## TREND TOWARDS INTERNATIONAL SMALL CAPS (CONT.)
 - Conceptually, it makes sense that multinationals and large global players in EMs offer less diversification
	‒ But again, we also need to consider expected [[Assets|returns]] and volatility
 - While foreign small caps can be attractive from a diversification or growth perspective, they tend to have larger risks and pose challenges in terms of
	‒ Information
	‒ Corporate governance
	‒ [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|Liquidity]]
 - These risks matter especially for M&A

## WHAT ABOUT CRISES?
 - [[Week 8 Opportunities And Risks Of Investing Internationally|Diversification benefits]] and optimal allocations change through time
	‒ See earlier graphs
 - During financial or corona crisis, there was no place to hide (in equities)
	‒ See next slide
 - Do we really believe that we can hedge against a major [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]] (rocking banks in developed countries) by buying shares in China (or elsewhere)?
	 ‒ China is highly dependent on the U.S. consumer
	‒ [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|Financial markets]] have never been more interconnected
	‒ This risk is better addressed with [[Lecture 2- [[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|Asset Allocation]] with [[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|Multiple Risky Assets]]|[[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|asset allocation]]]] (across classes of assets)
 - So not really an argument against diversification

## CORRELATIONS WITH U.S. RETURNS IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS

 ![500](63ef2bab6295c5af5492a5915d7a1787.png)

 - Similar results could be shown for other crises
 - Despite widespread negative [[Assets|returns]], there are substantial differences in how EMs fare during crises
 - Crisis performance often depends on countries' legal and political institutions
## TO WHAT EXTENT DO WE INVEST ABROAD?
 - In sum, case for [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] in EMs as part of an equity [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] remains strong
	‒ EMs offer substantial [[Week 8 Opportunities And Risks Of Investing Internationally|diversification benefits]]
	‒ EMs provide interesting [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] opportunities
 - Nevertheless, there is significant home bias around the world
	‒ Traditional [[Lecture 2- [[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|Asset Allocation]] with [[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|Multiple Risky Assets]]|[[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|asset allocation]]]]: Domestic/international is still common
 - Traditional explanation: Barriers to foreign [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]], e.g.,
	‒ Capital and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] controls;
	‒ Transaction and trading costs
	‒ Different accounting standards
 - Many traditional barriers to foreign [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] have decreased over time:
	‒ Adoption of [[Week 9-Information Risks and (International) Accounting Differences, Platform Businesses|international accounting]] standards (IFRS)
	‒ Financial liberalizations in many countries
 - However, home bias has not declined much, given the decline in barriers
	‒ Barriers and transaction costs alone cannot explain home bias

## HOME BIAS IN U.S. INVESTORS' PORTFOLIOS

## HOME BIAS IN U.S. INVESTORS' PORTFOLIOS (CONT.)

 ![500](a259b76f2205e9b6bebc185dd4426d39.png)

- HOME BIAS HAS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGED FROM 1994 TO 2004

## NON -TRADITIONAL REASONS FOR HOME BIAS
 - Behavioral and cultural [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|biases]] (e.g., familiarity)
 - Concentrated ownership around the world
	‒ Home bias is much smaller once we adjust for availability of shares (free float)
 - What countries and which foreign stocks do U.S. investors shy away from? (e.g., Leuz et al., RFS 2009)
	‒ U.S. investors invest less in countries with poor institutions and firms where the managers and their families have high levels of control
	‒ Result is particularly pronounced for firms with poor info flows
 - Information and governance problems can explain a good deal of home bias
	‒ Information and governance explanations have different implications than behavioral or cultural [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|biases]]
	‒ There can be good reasons why investors put less money in certain foreign markets

# INTERNATIONAL RISKS
## INTERNATIONAL RISKS
 - [[Chapter 1-Introduction to Globalization|International investments]] have a broad range of risks
	‒ "Classic" international risks: [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] and macroeconomic risks
 - But there are other issues to consider
	‒ Poor outside investor and legal protection
	 ‒ Corporate governance and expropriation by controlling insiders
	‒ Transparency and information risks
	‒ Corruption and political risk (e.g., expropriation by government)
 - These factors matter particularly in financial crises
	‒ They can explain crisis [[Assets|returns]] (e.g., Asian crisis)
	‒ [[Trading and Liquidity|Market liquidity]] and ability to trade is closely linked to transparency
	‒ Transaction costs (in particular price impact)
 - Lecture will cover a number of these risks

# MEASURING INTERNATIONAL RISKS
## MEASURING INTERNATIONAL AND COUNTRY RISKS
 - There are many useful sources
	‒ Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)
	‒ His Economics and [[How Countries Go Broke-Chapter 15 & Chapter 16|Country Risk]]
	‒ Institutional Investor Country Credit Ratings (IICCR)
	‒ International [[How Countries Go Broke-Chapter 15 & Chapter 16|Country Risk]] Guide (ICRG)
 - Measuring institutional quality is a major effort at the World Bank and IMF
	‒ Worldwide Governance Indicators & Doing Business Reports
 - Measuring political risks is still an art rather than a science
 - - Scores often map into sovereign spreads
	‒ Priced in cost of capital
 - Scores can beuseful to quantify country differences as well as the  components of [[How Countries Go Broke-Chapter 15 & Chapter 16|country risk]]

## INTERNATIONAL COUNTRY RISK GUIDE (ICRG): RISK CATEGORIES

| Risk Category   | Composite Score Range   |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Very High Risk  | 0.0-49.5                |
| High Risk       | 50.0-59.5               |
| Moderate Risk   | 60.0-69.5               |
| Low Risk        | 70.0-84.5               |
| Very Low Risk   | 85.0-100.0              |

# INTERNATIONAL COST OF CAPITAL IN PRACTICE
## HOW DO WE CAPTURE INTERNATIONAL RISKS?
 - Cost of capital is frequently used to account for international risks
	‒ These factors are generally not captured in and compensated w/ beta
	‒ Common to make adjustments to cost of capital
 - How should we determine the cost of capital?
	‒ Lecture will cover some alternatives
 - What do practitioners do?
	‒ Most practitioners start with CAPM (see Readings for Week 8)
	‒ Make adjustments to the CAPM to account for country risks
 - Common to use sovereign spreads over U.S. treasury yields to capture country risks: e.g.,
	‒ $$-\mathrm{CoC=R_f^{US}+Beta^*(U.S.~Equity~Premium)+SS}$$
## WHAT DO PRACTITIONERS DO?
 - There are many different models and proposed approaches
	‒ Different values for Exxon Mobile [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] in Argentina (in 2005):
 ![500](0555ef14899a81b739ae1ad30cf57de7.png)
 - Salomon Smith Barney survey (2002):
"Unfortunately, the only real consensus is that there is no consensus on how to estimate the international cost of capital. Almost every academic or practitioner has a different recommendation."
