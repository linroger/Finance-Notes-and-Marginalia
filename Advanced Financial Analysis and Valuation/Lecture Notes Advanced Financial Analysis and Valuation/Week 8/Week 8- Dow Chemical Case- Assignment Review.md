# Week 8 - Dow Chemical Case - Assignment Review
## File Information

- **Course**: Advanced Financial Analysis and Valuation
- **Week**: 8
- **Topic**: International Project Valuation - Dow Chemical PBB Case
- **Instructor**: Thomas Rauter
# Advanced Financial Analysis and Valuation of Global Firms
## Dow's Bid for the Privatization of PBB
- In Nov 1995, Dow Chemical is considering bidding on PBB, which is being privatized by the Argentine government
- Base-case cash flows for the project that include some operational efficiency improvements have been prepared
- Case requires the valuation of an international project
- Key questions:
  - Think about international risks
  - How to incorporate risks into the valuation model?
  - What risk premium and cost of capital would you use?
  - Two scenarios:
    - Expropriation
    - Currency crisis
## Background on Dow and PBB
- Running a plant complex such as PBB is exactly what Dow does (see Table B, Exhibits 1A and 1B)
  - By 1995, it had 94 plants in more than 30 countries
- Dow's first Latin American investment was in 1957
  - Investments in Colombia, Chile, Brazil, and Argentina
  - Largest investment is in Brazil where it has a petrochemical complex
- What spurred the privatization of PBB?
  - In 1995, all trade restrictions between members of Mercosur were lifted
  - As a result, competition was going to increase
    - Brazilian producers had a larger scale and were more efficient
    - PBB facilities require upgrading
- On Oct, 2 1995, Argentina announced intent to sell 51% of PBB
## Plan for Development of PE Business in Argentina
- Vignart (VP business development for LatAm) believed bringing all of Bahia Blanca's PE activity under Dow's control would be consistent with Dow's business model
- There are 3 project stages:
  - Stage 1: PBB acquisition (1 ethylene facility, 1 polyethylene facility) and upgrading of facilities to make them internationally competitive
    - Dow would need to bid against Copesul and Perez Companc, regional players who teamed up to bid for PBB
  - Stage 2: Polisur acquisition (2 polyethylene facilities)
    - Dow would need to negotiate with Ipako, the private owner of Polisur
  - Stage 3: Expansion of capacity (construct new ethylene facility (or cracker) and a new polyethylene plant)
    - Dow would need to secure supply of additional ethane and find a reliable partner
- Question: Should you evaluate all three stages for the bid or only the first one?
## Evaluating All Project Stages for Valuation
- Argument for considering the value of cash flows from all 3 stages:
  - Think about the business rationale of the second and third stage
  - Unlikely Dow would invest in any one of these stages as a standalone project
  - Vignart: "If we were to get into the privatization, the project would require the modernization of existing facilities and … expansion of existing plants and the construction of new plants, in order to become internationally competitive."
- Obviously, Dow would not necessarily bid the entire NPV from all three stages
- But to decide whether bidding is worth doing, Dow has to consider all three stages
  - Bid will be for 51% stake only
- We have cash flows for entire complex (all three stages)
## Stage 1 Forecasts Reflect Interdependencies
- Stage 1 already includes some upgrading and two separate cash flows:
  - 1) Ethylene cracker
    - Forecast assumes cracker's operating rate improves from 90.2% to 100%
    - Dow will operate cracker more efficiently due to the $72.9MM capital investment$
    - Ethane ratio remains constant: Plant's efficiency can't be improved, which is why Dow needs to build a more efficient cracker in Stage 3
  - 2) Polyethylene plant
    - Forecast assumes plant's operating rate increases from 65% to 100% driven by investments

## What Risks Does Dow Face? (Question 1)
- Given the cash flow estimates, the next step is to think about potential risks
- What risks does Dow face in Argentina from PBB investment?
  - We need to diagnose the critical risks of this investment
  - Business risks and country risks
- Thereafter: How should the risks be incorporated into the valuation analysis?
  - Discuss whether these risks are captured in the cash flows or need to be added to the discount rate
## What Are Critical Business Factors and Risks?
- Conversion rate (i.e., operating efficiency)
  - Depends on equipment, operating conditions
- Utilization of cracker
  - Massive fixed cost/capital investment
- Estimating demand - Selling locally is ideal
  - Avoids transportation costs, tariffs, duties, etc.
  - PE is a commodity with thin margins
- Price taker on input prices (Ethane)
- Output price determined by market (little pricing power)
- Question: Are these business factors specific to Argentina?
- Have they built them into the cash flows?
  - Forecasted cash flows are expectations and include planned operational changes
  - Cyclicality of demand and various prices built into the forecasts
  - Are there other risks?
## Potential Country Risks
- Currency risk
  - Argentina has a long history of sovereign defaults and currency crises
- Expropriation risk
  - Argentine government takes all or part of investment
- Tax risk
  - Government could increase taxes (on sales, profits, inputs, etc.)
- Repatriation risk
  - Government could restrict access to cash flows or ability to repatriate profits
  - Capital controls are common in crises
- Regulatory risk
  - Could impose pricing or supplier restrictions
## How Should We Incorporate the Various Risks?
- Do the forecasted cash flows capture these risks?
- In U.S., Dow uses a discount rate of 8-10% (already captures beta)
  - Would anyone use a discount rate of 10% for Argentina in 1995?
  - What risk premium would you add to debt, equity or WACC (as in Goldman model)?
- Let's take a poll
- What information do we have in the case to adjust the discount rate?
  - Sovereign spread between Argentina and the U.S. (Exhibit 12)
    - About 1000 bps (or 10%)
  - Sovereign spread reflects various country risks

## Valuation with Discount Rate Adjustments Scenario Analysis
!Valuation scenarios

## Scenario
- Core idea: Consider explicit risks
  - Bad outcome: Expropriation or currency crisis and drop in demand
- Scenario 1: Argentina experiences serious economic turmoil $\$a_t$$ the end of 2002
  - Government expropriates Dow, which has to abandon the facilities
- Scenario 2: Assume a currency crisis
- How did you handle these?
- Scenario 1: Could be handled in the cash flows
- Scenario 2: Currency risk is tied to Argentina's sovereign and difficult to model in the cash flows
  - Discount rate adjustments for currency risk are common
  - But let's think some more about the currency risks
## Risks Revisited: Currency Crisis
- What would be the impact of a currency devaluation in this case?
  - Inputs and outputs are all international commodities with prices in dollars
  - Variable costs of plant are in local currency
    - So, variable costs would even decrease
- More generally: During a currency or financial crisis, would you rather own a sovereign bond or a plant in Argentina?
  - Relevant risks are quite different
- What might we be missing?
  - Currency crisis likely affects local demand negatively
  - What option would Dow have?
    - Export backstop
    - Impact on profitability?
- What discount rate did you use for the scenarios?
## Scenario 1: 2003 Expropriation

## Scenario 2: 100% Exports

## Valuation in Different Scenarios

- Note that a discount rate of 20% implies risks that are much greater than no sales in Argentina and 50% tax on repatriated profits
- Useful reverse-engineering exercise: Ask how big the implied CF haircuts of discount factor adjustments are
## Outcome of Dow's Bid for PBB
- Dow won bid for 51% of PBB with an offer of $357.5M$
  - Dow reportedly used 10% as discount rate
  - If you scale 51% up to 100% they bid close to first-stage NPV
  - Proceeded to execute all 3 stages
- In 1996: Dow bought remaining stakes in PBB & Polisur; began construction of an ethylene cracker and polyethylene plant
- In 2001: Polyethylene production began in new plant
- Dow's total investment in the Bahia Blanca complex, including all three stages of the project, was $1.5 billion$
- In 2002, Argentina faces currency crisis:
  - Argentina abandoned fixed exchange rate and peso fell sharply
  - However, Dow's PE business performed extremely well throughout and subsequent to the crisis in Argentina
  - Key to Dow's success was that Dow could export PE that it could not sell locally
  - In general, exporters with local costs did well subsequent to depreciation

## What Else Could One Consider?
!Additional considerations

- Dow treated it like a capital budgeting project from the parent shareholder perspective, and not like buying a private company
## Survey of What People Do
- Discount rate adjustments are common (see table below)
  - Risks need to be handled consistently, either in cash flows or the discount rate
  - Double counting is a major issue
!Practitioner survey results

## Summing Up
- Be explicit about what certain risks would do to your business or target
  - Crises often create winners and losers
- In many settings, foreign investors (FDI or portfolio) are better positioned because of their access to global product or capital markets
  - Export backstop
  - Foreign multinationals are often not expropriated because they would be a "prominent victim"
- Thus, some of the typical country risks might not apply to your investment
  - Think specifically about "bad" outcomes rather than simple adjustments to discount rates
## Summing Up (Continued)
- At a minimum, assess whether implied CF consequences and valuation discount seem plausible
- Increasing the discount rate penalizes long-term investments and skews incentives in favor of short-term ones
- Given how difficult it is to properly adjust the discount rate, try hard to first handle risks in the expected cash flows using scenarios
  - It might be better to have "messy" conversations about specific risks that your foreign investment faces
  - Modelling risks in the cash flows brings people in operations into the conversation
  - But: Remember to then "dial-down" discount factor (double counting)
