  - Alternative approaches

## Valuing International Investments

Basic principles are the same as for domestic projects
- DCF can be used to evaluate a (foreign) business plan, capital investment, and acquisitions

The same factors affect value around the globe:
- Future cash flows
- Timing of the cash flows (and the time value of money)
- Risk of the cash flows (systematic, non-diversifiable risks)

But in practice valuing international investments poses many challenges
- There are additional (or different) risks
- Need to be careful about how we capture those risks
- Numerous practical problems in quantifying the risks

## Importance of the Cost of Capital

Cost of capital determines the hurdle rate for investments
- Not just M&A but also capital budgeting, FDI, etc.
- What happens if companies (or investors) set hurdle rate for foreign investments too high?

Cost of capital is also relevant for other internal purposes:
- Divisional capital allocation

# International (or Institutional) Risks

## International Risks

International investments pose unique risks
- "Classic" international risks: Currency and macroeconomic shocks

But there are other issues to consider (recall Week 7)
- Outside investor and legal protection
- Corporate governance and expropriation by controlling insiders
- Transparency and information risks
- Corruption and political risk (including expropriation by government)

These factors are generally not captured in or compensated with beta
- Do you have them in your cash flows?

## Ownership Structure and Investor Protection

Concentrated ownership can create many conflicts
- Private benefits (e.g., to family)
- Related-party transactions
- Separation of control & cash flow rights: pyramids, superior voting rights

As discussed in Week 7, countries differ in how they protect outside investors
- Clearly, important consideration in valuation

There are differences in:
- Legal protection (e.g., against self-dealing, expropriation)
- Rules for corporate governance
- Legal enforcement (e.g., collateral enforceability)
- Efficiency of the courts
- Market discipline (e.g., analysts)

## Transparency

Information risk
- How likely is it that you, as a foreigner, have all the relevant information to assess the value of the investment?
  - Recall the Caterpillar/ERA example
- Transparency and reporting quality differs substantially across countries

Information risk is closely related to ownership structure and corporate governance (Leuz, Nanda & Wysocki, JFE 2003)
- Private benefit consumption creates incentives to withhold or hide information
- Poor investor protection, poor governance and poor transparency often go hand in hand (see Week 7 at the end)

Governance problems are often at the heart of accounting shenanigans or, worse, at the core of accounting scandals
- Enron, Tyco, Parmalat, Satyam, Wirecard, etc.

## Political Risk

Broad concept that encompasses the potentially adverse effects of a country's political environment

People often think of political risk in terms of direct expropriation: e.g.,
- May 1, 2007, Hugo Chavez announced that control of Venezuelan oil fields would transfer from international oil companies to PDVSA
- April 18, 2012, President Kirchner announced she was taking full control of Argentina's YPF, expropriating almost all of Repsol's majority stake

However, direct expropriation is fairly rare
- When it happens, it is often related to natural resources
- "Creeping" expropriation is much more common: e.g., taxes are raised, regulations are changed, etc.

## Forms of Political Risk and Investor Concerns

Political risk takes many forms
- Direct expropriation
- Expropriation by (special) taxes
- Rules favoring locals
- Corruption and political connections

Political risk is highly correlated with information & governance problems and macroeconomic issues
- Connected or corrupt firms generally have an incentive to be opaque
- Get funding from politically connected banks rather than capital markets

## How Do Emerging Markets Rank Overall?

*Source: Karolyi: Cracking the Emerging Markets Enigma*

## How Do Institutional Risks Matter?

- Matter for M&A deal or investment outcomes
  - Returns in EM markets are in part compensation for higher risks
- Investors' portfolio holdings reflect risk factors ("vote with their feet")
- Institutional factors and risks are "priced" in equity markets
  - Market liquidity
  - Valuations
- While country risk has become less important over time, it is still a large factor
  - Institutional factors matter more in crises, especially for EMs
  - Explain differences in crisis returns across countries (e.g., Asian crisis)
- Cost of capital
  - Hurdle rates for international investments differ
- Bottom line: You need to consider institutional factors and risks!

## International Differences in Cost of Equity: Hail and Leuz (2006)

!Cost of equity differences chart

$r_{AVG}$ = Average implied cost of equity for firms in this country from 1992 to 2001 based on local prices and local analyst forecasts

Note that these rates are the total cost of equity, not spreads over inflation or risk-free rates. We will come back to this below.

## What Explains These Differences in Cost of Capital?

Differences in business risks (e.g., industry)
- Typically captured in beta

Differences in inflation or risk-free rate (country level)

Differences in:
- Securities and transparency regulation
- Rule of law and legal enforcement
- Investor protection, expropriation risk & corporate governance

The country differences are not (fully) captured in beta
- They matter when setting the hurdle rate for investments

Important:
- International risks also manifest in cash flows

## Are Institutional Risks Diversifiable?

Some risks should be diversifiable
- An investor can hold a portfolio of similar companies from different countries
- Hail and Leuz (2006) show that the effects of institutional differences on the cost of capital decline as countries and markets become more integrated

But even if some risks are diversifiable, they are not irrelevant
- Need to adjust expected cash flows for the possibility of adverse future events
- Remember that you can always translate cash flow risks into discount factor adjustment
  - Key point: Some discount factor adjustments are in lieu of cash flow adjustments, and not because the risk is systematic (in a beta sense)

# International Valuation Process

## Global Valuation in Multiple Steps

!Global valuation process diagram

## Global Valuation: Step 1

!Global valuation step 1 diagram

HYPER-INFLATIONARY ECONOMY
- In hyper inflation countries, nominal forecasts are dominated by inflation rate
- Forecast real cash flows (exclude or back out inflation)
- Discount cash flows with a real interest rate

LOW TO MODERATE INFLATION ECONOMY
- Forecast nominal cash flows (include inflation)
- Discount cash flows with a nominal interest rate

## Global Valuation: Step 2

!Global valuation step 2 diagram

- Financial data are typically collected in local currency
  - Local currency data more relevant to local management
- Forecasts are often easier to do in local currency
  - Many information sources are in local currency
- Even if you forecast and discount in local currency, you can still convert NPV into home currency at spot exchange rate (after Step 5)

## Which Cash Flows Should You Use?

Basic principle:
- Use incremental cash flows
- Recall Medfield case (Week 5)

Should the cash flows be estimated from the perspective of the parent or the foreign sub?
- Relevant cash flows are those to the parent
- Use only cash flows that could be repatriated (net of transfer costs)

Follow 3-step process
- Start from perspective of the foreign project or subsidiary
- Adjust to the perspective of the parent or headquarters
- Take into account indirect costs and benefits to the group
  - This last step takes into account synergies

## Global Valuation: Step 3

!Global valuation step 3 diagram

- Assess possible risks to see whether they are separately identifiable and could be captured in projected (future) cash flows
- Risks that are captured in this step should no longer be "included" in the discount rate
  - Do not double count!
- This allocation of risks is probably the hardest part of global valuation process

## How to Capture Risks in Cash Flows Using Scenarios

Steps:

[^1]: Identify risks and estimate their probabilities of occurrence
[^2]: Estimate at what point in time these risks are most likely to occur
[^3]: Identify the impact of each risk on future cash flows
[^4]: Calculate expected value of cash flows by weighting the cash flows in each scenario by the probability of the scenario

Simple example: Information risk
- Suppose that you are worried that you can't tell the condition of the factory you are buying
- Assign a probability (suppose 50%) that you will have to spend much more in capex the second year of the project to replace things that seemed fine upon initial inspection

An easy way to implement scenarios is to create separate "tabs" for each scenario
- You can weight the NPVs in each scenario by the probabilities

Alternative way to capture risks: Adjust the discount rate

## Illustrating Scenario vs. Risk Premium Approach

!Scenario vs risk premium comparison

## Reasons to Adjust Cash Flows

It often seems that many (international) risks are too hard to quantify
- But are "whole-sale" adjustments of cost of capital better?
- It is easy to overestimate risks with "simple" discount rate adjustments

Cash flow adjustments provide more information
- Acknowledges a broader range of outcomes
- Communicate the potential risks

Keep in mind that project proposals often need to be submitted to HQ
- Relevant information is often local (or in operations)

Encourages risk mitigation by making certain risks apparent
- Deals are structured to mitigate risks

## Reasons to Adjust Cash Flows (Continued)

Typical country risks to portfolio investors (which are reflected in equity market returns or sovereign spreads) may not apply to M&A or FDI
- Proposed investment may have features that are different from typical stock market investment in the country
  - You have control
  - Foreign multinationals are often not expropriated because they would be a "prominent victim"
  - In many settings (e.g., crises), foreign multinationals fare differently than local companies

Thus, it makes sense to think specifically about "bad" outcomes rather than simple discount rate adjustments
- Cash flow adjustments allows you to capture the specifics of your investment

Alternative: Make more tailored adjustments to the cost of capital

## Global Valuation: Step 4 (Optional)

!Global valuation step 4 diagram

Future cash flows can be translated into home currency using forward rates:
- Obtain these forward rates from banks or FX traders, but they
  - Contain currency risk premia (be careful about double counting)
  - Are typically not available for more than 18 months or a few years into future
- Compute implied or synthetic forward rates using covered interest rate parity:
  - Use spot exchange rate and interest rates in two countries to convert

Alternatively, we can discount with a local currency cost of capital in Step 5

## Global Valuation: Step 5

!Global valuation step 5 diagram

Be consistent:
- If you have converted cash flows into dollars in Step 4, then you need to use dollar discount rate (with dollar inflation expectation) in Step 5

Avoid double counting:
- The idea is to account for systematic risks from the perspective of home country parent shareholders
- You need to keep track of the risks you have handled in the cash flows; only the remainder should be in the discount rate

# Dow Chemical Case

## Specific Risk for the Privatization of PBB

- In Nov 1995, Dow Chemical is considering bidding on PBB, which is being privatized by the Argentine government
- Base-case cash flows for the project that include some operational efficiency improvements have been prepared
- Case requires the valuation of an international project
- Key questions:
  - Think about international risks
  - How to incorporate risks into the valuation model?
  - What risk premium and cost of capital would you use?
  - Two scenarios:
    - Expropriation
    - Currency crisis

# International Cost of Capital (WACC)

## Let's Start with What Most People Do

Recap from pre-recording:
- Only consensus is that there is no consensus

Most practitioners nevertheless use the CAPM (Readings for Week 8)
- Start with CAPM
- Make adjustments to the CAPM to account for country risks

$$\text{CoC} = R_f^{US} + \beta \times \text{U.S. Equity Premium} + \text{Sovereign Spread}$$

This approach uses the default risk of the sovereign as a proxy for country risks
- Not all sovereign risk is relevant (or systematic)

## Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

$$\text{WACC} = \frac{D}{V}r_d(1-\tau) + \frac{E}{V}r_e$$

Use target capital structure (based on market values)

Cost of debt
- If the foreign investment does not substantially change the parent's default risk and cost of debt, then simply use the cost of debt of parent company
- Otherwise, you need to adjust cost of debt to new default risk

Be careful about the currency:
- If you have converted cash flows into home (or domestic) currency, then using parent cost of debt in home currency is fine
- Otherwise, you need to use foreign (or local) currency cost of debt to account for inflation
  - Conversion with interest rate parity relation (next slide)

## Converting $ Cost of Capital to Local Cost of Capital

Assuming the "covered interest rate parity" relation holds, you can compute a foreign currency cost of capital as follows:

$$r_{Foreign} = (1+r_{US\$}) \times \frac{(1+\text{risk-free rate}_{Foreign})}{(1+\text{risk-free rate}_{US\$})} - 1$$

Or, alternatively:

$$r_{Foreign} = (1+r_{US\$}) \times \frac{(1+\text{exp. inflation}_{Foreign})}{(1+\text{exp. inflation}_{US\$})} - 1$$

## Cost of Equity Capital Using the CAPM: $r_f$

$$\text{Cost of Equity} = r_e = r_f + \beta(r_m - r_f)$$

What do we use as the risk-free rate?
- Ideally, you would use a risk-free rate that matches the "duration" of the cash flows from the firm that you are valuing
- Common to use 10-year (or longer) U.S. treasuries as proxy

Long-term government bonds are not risk free in all countries
- Could use U.S. treasuries, but they reflect inflation expectations for U.S.
  - Need to adjust for differences in inflation rates across currencies
- Again, remember to use same currency for cash flows and cost of capital

## Cost of Equity Capital Using the CAPM: Equity Premium

$$\text{Cost of Equity} = r_e = r_f + \beta(r_m - r_f)$$

What have you used for the equity risk premium?

U.S. equity premium from 1903 to 2002:
- Arithmetic average = 6.2%
- Arithmetic average is the best estimator but it compounds measurement error when returns are serially correlated
- Adjusting for serial correlation, the arithmetic average is about 5.5%

Risk premia need to be computed over long horizons
- Distant past may not be representative of the future
  - Equity premium likely has decreased over time
  - But risk premia can also go up in response to financial or economic crises

## Illustrating Problems with Historical Equity Premium

Historical equity premium still seems to reflect a country's development, history and also industry concentration

!Historical equity premium by country

## Historical vs. Implied Premia

## Implied Cost of Capital at Market Level (Using DDM)

You could do this calculation for foreign indices OR add country risk premium to equity RP on the left

## Cost of Equity Capital Using the CAPM: Beta

$$\text{Cost of Equity} = r_e = r_f + \beta(r_m - r_f)$$

Notion of diversification and systematic risk applies to foreign investments
- In fact, foreign investments might offer higher diversification potential
- Thus, foreign investments could even have a lower cost of capital
- Of course, we also need to account for the additional (country) risks

What is conceptually the "right" perspective for foreign investments?
- Parent company shareholders, parent firm, foreign shareholders?

Basic principle:
- Contribution of foreign investment to systematic risk borne by parent company (home country) shareholders
- The principle is the same for domestic and foreign projects as well as projects in different industries

## Cost of Equity Capital Using the CAPM: Beta (Continued)

Thus, beta of foreign investment has to be evaluated from perspective of parent company shareholders (or home country investors)

Assume parent company shareholders are mostly from home country:
- Mexican manager who considers building a plant in the U.S. computes beta of the investment relative to the Mexican index
- U.S. manager who considers building a plant in Mexico computes the beta of the investment relative to the U.S. index

This assumption is not unreasonable:
- Many equity markets are not fully integrated
- Shareholders exhibit significant home bias
- Supported by empirical evidence (pre-recording)

Why not use World CAPM (e.g., MSCI ACWI)?

# Alternative Approaches

## Implied Cost of Capital: Firm and Market Level

Economic profit model can be used for reverse engineering to obtain an estimate for the (implied) cost of capital
- Could be used for other parameters as well (e.g., implied growth rate)

You have to assume that the market prices a firm on average correctly
- Then, we can use analysts' (consensus) forecasts about future earnings and growth as a proxy for the market's expectations
- Back out an estimate of cost of equity capital "implied" by the market price

Spreadsheet on Canvas implements four models used in the Hail and Leuz (2006) to estimate firm-level cost of capital

## Erb, Harvey and Viskanta (1996) Approach

Return-based approach (but no market index required)
- Basic idea is similar to practitioner models
  - Political and country risks should be reflected in country (sovereign) credit risk ratings, but some may be diversifiable
- Model for Cost of Equity:

$$R_{country} = \alpha + \beta \times \ln(\text{Country Credit Risk Rating})$$

Ad-hoc approach but works well in practice
- Good fit with returns and sovereign bond ratings

Implied cost of capital has solid theoretical basis
- Estimates of Hail/Leuz (2006) and EHV approach are highly correlated: ≈ 0.64
- Both models "agree" on relative risks

With EHV approach, you can compute cost of equity for 136 countries

## Erb, Harvey and Viskanta (1996) Approach (Continued)

KEY INPUT: INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR COUNTRY CREDIT RISK RATINGS
- Euromoney publishes ratings semiannually
- Based on survey of 75-100 bankers
- Ratings are on a scale of 0-100
- Higher scores are better – highest possible is 100

!Country credit risk ratings chart

## Illustration of EHV Approach

Plug rating into the model:
- Cost of equity capital = 12×(0.051537 - 0.01036×Ln(IICCR))
- Ln(IICCR) is natural logarithm of country credit risk rating

Taking the log is important as the relation is likely to be nonlinear
- As credit ratings get low, expected returns may go up faster

Model provides a dollar-denominated cost of capital estimate
- Again, this rate can be converted to local currency cost of capital

Example:
- Assume U.S. investor or multinational investing in Peru
- Peru's IICCR as of March 2019 = 59.2

Plug into formula to compute discount rate:
- Cost of equity capital = 11.11%
- In $ from perspective of US investor

## Adjusting the Risk Premium: Basic Idea

Use different sources and your knowledge about the investment to assign weights for the risks that go into the average premium
- Then assess to what extent your specific project is exposed to these particular risks and adjust according to the weights
- These adjustments and approaches are "fuzzy" but as Keynes said:
  - "It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong"

For example, Karolyi radar charts:

!Karolyi radar chart

Note: The lower (or the more negative) the numbers the higher the risk

## Key Lessons: International Cost of Capital

There is no generally accepted approach to computing cost of capital for global investments
- There are many approaches
- But many common practices have conceptual flaws

Implied cost of capital is forward looking and hence often more relevant

Consider tailoring your cost of capital and beware of double counting
- These adjustments are "fuzzy"
- Setting the cost of capital too high means that you are missing out on positive NPV opportunities
- Compute the "implied haircut" to cash flows
