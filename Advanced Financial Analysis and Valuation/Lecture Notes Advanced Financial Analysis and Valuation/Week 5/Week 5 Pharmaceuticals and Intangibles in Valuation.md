## Today's Topics

- Health care & pharmaceuticals
  - Moats
  - Value drivers
  - Accounting Shenanigans
- Importance of intangible assets
- Accounting treatment of intangible investments
  - Effects of accounting treatment
  - Does capitalization matter?
- Economic profit model and terminal value revisited

  - Adjusting for intangibles in relative valuation
- Medfield Case
- Goodwill and M&A (vs. organic growth)

## Moat Sources in Health Care Sector

- Frequency of moats is high in health care sector
  - Substantial entry barriers and start-up costs
  - But moat sources depend on type of industry (within sector)

## Different Health Care Firms and Business Models

### Pharmaceuticals
- Tend to have (wide) moats based on intangibles (i.e., patents; usually 20 years)
- But long research and approval process implies that effective patent protection is shorter than 20 years
- Key considerations:
  - Diversity of drug portfolio and patent expiry
  - Development and pipeline of new drugs
  - Size of pharma company (e.g., funding, ability to manage and sustain long process)
  - Market size (heart disease, cancer) & substitutes – disease websites (e.g., cancer.gov)

### Biotech Companies
- Biotech companies (biologic drugs as opposed to chemical)
  - Tend to be smaller and riskier, more like options
  - Biotech risk is often idiosyncratic
  - Again, size of the market is a key consideration
- Valuation often requires decision trees or scenario analysis

## Drug Development Process

### Drug Development Process Overview

!500

### Typical Cash Flow Profile

!500

## Different Health Care Firms & Business Models (Cont.)

### Medical Device Companies
- Make implantable hardware for human body
- Moat sources tend to be intellectual property (intangibles) but also physician relationships (switching costs)
  - Marketing and sales force
  - Training and tools for implants
- Compared to pharma, innovation tends to be more evolutionary rather than disruptive or revolutionary
  - Though lately pharma is characterized by lots of "me-too" drugs

### Managed Care & Insurance Companies
- Subject to intense regulatory pressure
- Economies of scale can provide cost advantages
- Network effects

## Value Drivers and Forecasting in Pharma

!500

- High profit margins
  - Patent protection
- Substantial investments
  - R&D
  - Low turnover (if capitalized)
- Evaluation of drug pipeline
  - Patent expiry
  - New patent applications and clinical trials
- Substantial medical expertise is required
- Analysts model revenues of key drugs and pipelines separately
  - See illustrations below

### Pfizer: Pipeline

### Example: Alector

!500

- Founded in 2013, based in South San Francisco, CA
- Focuses on development of drugs to eliminate neurodegeneration (e.g., dementia, Alzheimer's) through immuno-neurology

### Example: Alector (Visible Alpha)

## CF Shenanigans Health Care & Pharma

### Sinopharm: Financing Payables

!500

- The company appears to report borrowings as AP to boost OCF

### CF Shenanigans: Citi and Enron

!500

- From 1998 to 2001 Citi and Enron engaged in a series of transactions to "create" operating cash inflows for Enron
- A large share of these transactions was structured as prepay transactions
  - Each transaction seemingly transfers commodity risk
  - Jointly, no commodity risk is transferred and Enron essentially receives a short-term loan, but it classifies the cash inflow as operating cash flow
    - Future fixed payment of $255.6 million
    - Upfront payment of $249.5 million

## Importance of Intangibles

### Importance of Intangible Assets

!500

- Shift from manufacturing to service & technology
- Many key assets of firms are intangibles:
  - R&D and patents
  - Brands and advertising
  - Training and human capital investments

### R&D Spending and Intangible Intensity by Sector

!500

### Economics of Intangibles

- What makes intangibles special?
  - Non-rival: Can be consumed by many
  - Non-excludable: Hard to prevent the use by others
- Scalability
  - Large upfront costs, few costs later (e.g., drug molecule or biologic)
  - Network effects
- Sunkenness
  - Tangible assets retain more resale value due to their standardization
- Spillovers
  - Non rival and non excludable leads to imitation
- Synergies
  - Innovation arises from combining technologies that already exist
- Intangible investments often yield extreme outcomes
  - Complete loss (ROI = -100%)
  - High or even monopolistic profitability (ROI >> 15%)

## Accounting Treatment of Intangibles

### Intangibles on the Books

!500

### Accounting Treatment of Intangibles

- Core idea behind the accounting treatment of investments:
  - Any expenditure that creates benefits over many years is an investment (or asset)
  - Expenditures that generate benefits only in current year are operating expenses
  - Therefore, capital expenditures for PP&E are investments
- But intangibles also generate future benefits and require capital expenditures:
- Accountants have treated these expenditures as operating expenses
  - Unless they acquired in market transaction
  - Acquired intangibles (e.g., via M&A, etc.) are capitalized and amortized
- Since the TCJA, IRS also requires amortization of R&D (5 years)

### Intangible Investments Are Not Just R&D

!500

### Evidence from SEC Enforcement Actions

### Improper Capitalization

- Improper capitalization of costs goes straight to the bottom line
  - Could be used to increase profits
- American Italian Pasta Company (AIPC):
  - From 2002 through 2Q04, AIPC met EPS targets due to improper capitalization
  - For example, AIPC capitalized more than $10 million of internal pasta manufacturing costs as long-lived manufacturing assets
  - AIPC also capitalized $1.4 million of labor costs related to internal management information systems (MIS) to long-lived IT assets
  - Illustrates the concern that companies "make up" assets

### Does the Market Treat R&D Expenditures as Expenses?

- Even though many intangible investments are not capitalized, there is info in 10-K:
  - R&D expenses are disclosed:
    - Income statement, cash flow statement and R&D footnote
    - But recall: R&D expenses can be buried in COGS and SG&A
- Academic evidence suggests that investors understand the "investment" nature of these expenditures
  - Market pricing of R&D and marketing expenses is positive (but also hampered by lack of detailed information)

## OncoMed - An Example

### OncoMed Pharmaceuticals (OMED)

!500

- OncoMed is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel therapeutics for cancers
  - In April 2019, acquired by Mereo Biopharma (no longer listed)
- Four internally discovered anti-cancer therapeutic candidates:
  - Navicixizumab
  - Anti-TIGIT
  - GITRL-Fc
  - Rosmantuzumab

- Note: They had a large A/R that Celgene owed them as a result of a safety milestone in a trial. Payment in 2016 reduced assets (A/R) and hence NOA.

Source: OncoMed Pharmaceutical Annual Reports

### OncoMed Pharmaceuticals (OMED): Summary

- From 2011-2017 OncoMed has recorded revenue of $222.6M and has spent $468.9M in R&D
  - Over same period, accumulated increase in NOAs of just $72.6M
  - Their financials are more affected by payments due to strategic alliances than their operations
- Cash and short-term investments represent the bulk of their assets
  - No financial debt at this stage of the life-cycle
  - Most of the capital is raised via equity
- Accounting numbers do not make much sense
  - In 2016, OncoMed reports negative NOA
  - Very low (or even negative) reinvestment rates (as a percentage of revenue)
  - This contrasts with the high R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue

## Consequences for Financial Analysis & Valuation

- How does lack of capitalization affect profits and ROIC?
  - Effect on profit depends on growth
  - Regardless, book value/invested capital is understated
  - Thus, ROIC is overstated
- How does lack of capitalization affect valuation?
  - In principle, no effect on DCF or Economic Profit models
  - Cash flows are not affected
- So why do we care?
  - Capitalization can influence your view of true economic profitability (and hence your forecasting)
  - Link between investments and value creation (future benefits)

### Consequences for Financial Analysis & Valuation (Cont.)

- Relative valuation and terminal value calculations become even trickier:
  - Reinvestment is buried in operating expenses
  - Recall: Reinvestment is a function of RONIC and growth (Week 3 & 4)
- Accounting treatment can distort RONIC in TV formula
  - Conceptually, you expect a higher RONIC without capitalization of intangible investments (see previous slide)
- Recall pre-recording: Accounting treatment creates incomparability depending on firms' growth strategies

## Economic Profit Model and the Effect of Intangibles

### Review: Economic Profit Model

!500

- Covered the EP model in Week 3 (see also Chapter 8 in Koller et al.)

### Terminal Value for Economic Profit Model

!500

- What is a reasonable prediction for the terminal value in economic profit model?
  - Think about the numerator of the TV equation
- By their very definition, economic profits (EP) are hard to sustain:
  - Positive EP → Competitors enter
  - Negative EP → Takeover, management fired, restructuring, etc.
  - Thus, small or zero terminal value after several years is not unreasonable
- We should see decay in economic profits

### Why Might Econ Profits Persist (Even with Competition)?

- Economic Profit Is Based On Accounting Numbers
  - We measure true economic profits only if invested capital is valued properly
- But consider how operating assets (or book value of equity) are valued:
  - What happens if IC is incorrectly measured?
  - Why might IC be typically too low?
    - Self-generated intangibles: Our topic of the week
- If book value does not capture intangible assets:
  - Accounting-based EP is too high (as cost of capital charge given IC is too low)
- Thus, there are two sources of accounting-based economic profits
  - True economic profits & accounting measurement
- As noted earlier, this insight also has implications for the terminal value:
  - Accounting-based EP (based on understated IC) may persist beyond the point where true economic profits are zero

### Terminal Value for Economic Profit Model (Cont.)

- Does EP model still work for valuation?
  - Equality with DCF holds for any (clean-surplus) accounting system
    - EV(DCF) = EV(EP) → See pre-recording
- Thus, it does not matter for value whether or not a firm capitalizes R&D
  - Bias in accounting does not invalidate accounting-based valuation
  - But: Accounting measurement matters for the magnitude of TV

### Illustrating R&D Capitalization in EP Model

- Assume two companies that are identical except,
  - Firm A expenses R&D;
  - Firm B capitalizes R&D, and amortizes it over two years
- Firm A's accounting is said to be more conservative, but does it matter for valuation?
  - Core idea: Accounting just allocates cash flows through time; it does not change them
  - Over the life of an asset or a firm: Sum CFs = Sum Profits
    - Follows from "clean surplus"
- To illustrate make following assumptions:
  - Assume cost of capital = 10%
  - Beginning book value = $200 (i.e., end of prior year)
  - Useful life of R&D is 2 years

### Illustrating R&D Capitalization in EP Model (Cont.)

!500

Note: Sum of total profits is 117.6 in both cases and taxes are based on IRS, not GAAP profits

### Benefits of EP Approach in Practice

- EP and DCF should give the same answer!
  - So what does EP add beyond DCF?
- EP helps us better understand value creation and economic performance
  - It can improve our forecasting (i.e., understanding of the firm)
  - It makes you think more critically about TV and long-term value creation
- EP model provides a link to market-to-book ratio
  - Difference between book value and market value: PV of future EPs
- EP model lends itself to reverse engineering
  - Analysts provide earnings forecasts that you can use directly as inputs
- Using both DCF and ABV should help the internal consistency of your model and the plausibility of your assumptions

## Adjusting for Intangibles in Intrinsic Value Models (DCF & EP)

### Adjusting for Intangibles in DCF (or EP) Models

- Irrespective of the accounting standards, you could capitalize R&D expenses
  - Could do the same with other operating expenses that are really investments
  - FCF does not change, but adjusting for intangibles likely provides more meaningful profitability and reinvestment rates
  - Again: It is about the insights you gain into the economics of the firm and how that affects your forecasts!
- Assumption needed: How long does it take for R&D to be converted, on average, into commercial product?
  - Useful life of research asset = amortization period
  - R&D expenses (or research assets) at a pharmaceutical company should have fairly long lives
  - R&D expenses (or research assets) at software firms should have shorter lives

### OncoMed Pharmaceuticals (OMED) – R&D Capitalization

- Adjusting earnings, reinvestment rates, and book value:
- Let's assume that R&D is amortized over a life of 10 years
  - Research stage lasts between 5-15 years
  - Post-approval protection period often not much longer than 10 years
  - Koller recommends 8-12 years
- From OMED's 424(b)4 filing (form filed prior to IPO on NASDAQ) and later SEC filings, we collect R&D expenses from 2007-2017
  - OMED went public in July 2013, but was incorporated in 2004

### OncoMed Pharmaceuticals (OMED) – R&D Capitalization Table

!500

- Perhaps easier to understand if you read backwards from 2017:
  - R&D from 2007 is now fully amortized (fraction = 0; last A = 2.8; no value left)

### OncoMed Pharmaceuticals (OMED) – EBIT Adjustment

- EBIT is adjusted by treating R&D as capital expenditures (like for PP&E)
- This implies:
  - 1) adding back all R&D expenditures
  - 2) subtracting the periodic amortization of the research asset(s)
- Companies with growing R&D expenditures will have a higher EBIT after the adjustment
  - In this case, the difference in EBIT is not huge:

!500

```
Adjustment for Operating Income/EBIT  
                                      -41.0
(+) R&D expenditures                   59.8
(-) Amortization of research asset     53.8
                                     ------
Adjusted EBIT                         -34.9
```

### OncoMed Pharmaceuticals (OMED) – NOA Adjustment

!500

- NOA is also adjusted adding the estimated value of the research asset(s)
  - In this case = $373.5m
- NOA is now positive, and profitability numbers make (much) more sense
  - Pre-tax ROIC remains negative as OMED is quite early in the life-cycle of the research process/drug development
- To adjust BV of equity, you would also add the value of research asset

### ROIC Adjusted for Intangible Investments

!500

## Adjusting for Intangibles in Relative Valuation

### Intangibles and Relative Valuation

- Treating R&D investments as operating expenses affects EPS, EBIT or EBITDA
  - Systematically affects multiples
  - Stock price reflects the value of R&D
  - PE ratios or EV/EBITDA ratios are likely upwardly biased
    - But exact effect is hard to predict
- If all the companies in the sector operate under the same accounting rules (expensing R&D), why should we adjust for intangibles?
  - Life-cycle: Effects of capitalization are generally much greater at young companies vs. mature companies
  - Different companies pursue different strategies (e.g., in-house R&D vs. acquiring patents or small companies)
  - Different intangible investments have different useful lives (or amortization periods)
- Bottom-line: Systematic effects in multiples that do not wash out

## Medfield Case

### Purpose of Case

- Useful intro to the pharmaceutical industry
  - Discusses trends (e.g., to biologics)
  - Increasing costs to bring drugs to market
  - Consolidation of the industry
- Key issues for drug companies
  - Patent expiration
  - Competition from generics
- Valuation exercise
  - Valuing existing pipeline (forecasting by product line; components)
  - Valuing a new strategy
  - Assessing the acquisition offer
- There is also an ethical or CSR dimension (important too)
  - "Tricks" to extend patents

## How to Treat Goodwill and Future M&A?

### Pharma Has Seen Lots of M&A

!500

### Forecasting Future M&A

- Should You Forecast (Potential) Future M&A Activity?
  - M&A gives rise to goodwill and intangibles on the balance sheet
- Key question: Are we trying to forecast a "realistic/accurate" future balance sheet? Is this necessary in order to get the valuation (roughly) right?
  - Forecasted BS is a means to an end
  - We need to capture investment (but it doesn't matter if via acquisitions)
- Ultimately, we need to forecast the value created by future M&A
- What is the value of future acquisitions?

### Value Creation by Type of Growth

!500

Source: Koller et al. Exhibit 2.7

### Value Creation with (Many) Smaller Deals?

!500

### M&A Value Creation: Experience and Serial Acquirers

!500

### Who Captures Value (If Any is Created)?

!500

## Putting it All Together

- If future M&A is close to zero NPV, then you can ignore it in DCF or EP model
  - Hold existing goodwill constant in forecasted BS
- But what if the firm likely creates value through its acquisitions?
- Your forecasted growth in sales and assets can be organic or through M&A
  - You can be agnostic about the way in which the firm creates value
  - The key is to get the value creation roughly right (in DCF or EP)
- But: Past acquisitions and resulting goodwill can affect your ratios (e.g., ROIC and turnover) and hence your forecasts
  - Take out amortization due to past M&A (if not replaced)? (see pre-recording)
- Note: You cannot take the same "comfort" in relative valuation/multiples:
  - Relative valuation or multiples are affected for sure
  - Organic growth vs. growth via acquisitions distorts multiples
- Illustrates again that multiples are very sensitive to accounting effects
