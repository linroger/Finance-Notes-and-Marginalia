# Week 5 Accounting Recap - R&D, Intangibles, M&A & Goodwill

## Accounting for R&D and Intangibles

### IFRS and US GAAP: Research & Development

!500

 | Difference | IFRS | US GAAP | 
 | --- | --- | --- | 
 | Internally Developed R&D and Intangibles | R: Research costs are expensed (IAS 38)<br>D: Internally developed intangible assets are generally capitalized and amortized | R&D: costs are generally expensed as incurred (ASC 730)<br>D: Exception for software<br>- special capitalization criteria:<br>• Software developed for internal use (application development stage)<br>• Software developed for sale to third parties (technological feasibility)<br>• Website development cost (under IFRS expensed) | 
 | Acquired In-Process R&D (IPR&D) Projects | The acquired IPR&D is capitalized (IAS 38.8, 24, 26) | Only IPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized post-acquisition<br>(Not capitalized when a single asset/group of assets is acquired, ASC 730-10-25-2c) |

### Does Capitalization Matter?

Assuming a useful life of 5 years:

### When Does Capitalization Matter?

- Firm growth, so R&D keeps growing:

!500

### Consequences for Valuation

- Capitalization doesn't matter in steady state
  - But with growth (differences), we have systematic effects on profits and assets
  - Affects profitability ratios
- Accounting creates additional inconsistencies depending on firms' growth strategies
  - Organic growth and self-generated assets are not capitalized
  - Acquiring these assets brings them on the balance sheet
  - Creates inconsistencies across peer firms

## M&A Accounting 101

### M&A Accounting Steps

- Once the acquisition closes, acquirer must allocate the purchase price
- Step #1 = Identify assets & liabilities @ fair value
  - Identifiable acquired assets & assumed liabilities from target's balance sheet
  - Identifiable intangible assets (e.g., value of brand name)
    - There are likely more newly recognized intangibles (both finite-lived and infinitely-lived) for intangible-intensive targets/industries
    - Valuation usually done with help of external consultants
- Step #2 = Assign rest of purchase price to goodwill
  - Goodwill = purchase price less identified assets & liabilities at fair value
  - Goodwill is tested annually for impairment

### M&A Accounting 101: Illustrative Example

- Assume Big Buys Little For $50MM. Little Has Net Assets Of $15MM
  - Little has net assets of $15M: $5M cash, $5M A/R, $10M PPE, $5M debt
    - Big determines that the value of Little's PPE should be stepped up by $5M to meet fair value of the assets
    - Big identifies that Little has intangible assets worth $5M
  - Therefore, Big books goodwill of $50MM – ($15MM + $5MM + $5MM) = $25MM

### History of Goodwill Impairment

- Goodwill used to be amortized over long horizon
  - M&A transactions created permanent "earnings drag"
  - One could argue the amortization assured that managers had to earn what they paid in the acquisition
- There were two ways to account for M&A transactions
  - Purchase method
  - Pooling of Interest method (no goodwill)
  - Firms had strong preference for pooling (to avoid amortization)
- FASB eliminated pooling but stipulated that goodwill is reviewed for impairment
  - More details on next slide, but involves determining if FV of goodwill declined
  - In principle, good idea
  - But it gives massive discretion to firms

### Goodwill Write-Down at Kraft Heinz

- 15.4 billion write down on brands
  - Due to changing consumer taste
  - Kraft and Oscar Mayer trademarks
  - Assets less valuable than at merger in 2015
- Leading to SEC reaction:
  - Subpoena for policies, procedures and internal controls related to procurement
- Poor fourth quarter earnings
  - $12.6 billion net loss (in fourth quarter)
  - Kraft missed analysts' estimates
  - Dividend cut (by 22.5 cents to 40 cents)
- Key point:
  - It is not goodwill per se that matters but what we learn from write-down about future of the company
  - In this case, write down signaled considerable issues

## Intangible Amortization and Non-GAAP Reporting

### PE vs. EBITA Multiples in Pharma

!500

- Remember: Koller et al. (Chapter 16) recommend EBITA multiple
- They exclude acquisition-related amortization from EBIT: Why?
  - Makes firms that grow organically vs. through M&A more comparable
  - Amortization related to other intangibles related to operations (e.g., software) should be left in EBIT
- Forward-looking operating multiples reflect long-term prospects
  - Implied growth rates and cost of capital seem fairly similar
