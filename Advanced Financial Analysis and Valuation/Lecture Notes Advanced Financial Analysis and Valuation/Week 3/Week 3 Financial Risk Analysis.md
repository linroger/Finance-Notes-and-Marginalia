# Week 3 Financial Risk Analysis

## ADVANCED FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND VALUATION

## FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS

### FINANCIAL RISK ANALYSIS

- Valuation Process
	- Forecast cash flows (or earnings)
	- Build valuation model and discount CFs
		- Today:
			- Finish Risk Analysis
			- focus on financial risk
			- Start with forecasting (mechanics)

### BASIC ISSUES IN LENDING

- "Lemons" Problem (Ex Ante)
	- Who will accept a loan at a given rate?
	- Raising the interest rate does not fix the problem
	- Credit rationing and analyzing the borrower's financial situation are potential solutions (or responses)
- Risk-Incentive Problem (Ex Post)
	- Subsequent increases in credit risk transfer wealth from the lender to the borrower
	- Analyze whether risk or strategy has changed
	- Place Covenants into the lending agreement
- Information And Risk Analysis Are Critical With Respect To Both Problems

### FINANCIAL RISK ANALYSIS TOOLBOX

- Ratio Analysis
	- Liquidity: What are the borrower's short-term cash needs?
	- Capital structure or solvency: What is the borrower's financial leverage?
	- Coverage: Can the company service its debt?
	- Profitability: Can it produce sustainable cash flows?
- Risk prediction using models that combine ratios
	- Discriminant analysis
	- Default prediction models
- Credit scoring from external sources
	- Moody's & S&P

### LIQUIDITY RATIOS

- Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- Quick (Acid-Test) Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
- Cash Ratio = Cash / Current Liabilities
- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities

### SOLVENCY RATIOS

- Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt / Total Equity
- Debt-to-Assets = Total Debt / Total Assets
- Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense
- Debt Service Coverage = (EBIT + Depreciation) / (Interest + Principal)

### PROFITABILITY RATIOS (RELEVANT FOR CREDIT)

- Return on Assets (ROA) = Net Income / Total Assets
- Return on Equity (ROE) = Net Income / Total Equity
- EBITDA Margin = EBITDA / Revenue
- Operating Cash Flow Margin = Operating Cash Flow / Revenue

### ALTMAN Z-SCORE

Original Z-Score for Public Manufacturing Companies:

Z = 1.2(Working Capital/Total Assets) + 1.4(Retained Earnings/Total Assets) + 3.3(EBIT/Total Assets) + 0.6(Market Value of Equity/Book Value of Debt) + 1.0(Sales/Total Assets)

- Z > 2.99: "Safe" Zone
- 1.80 < Z < 2.99: "Grey" Zone
- Z < 1.80: "Distress" Zone

### PIOTROSKI F-SCORE

Nine fundamental signals:
1. Positive Net Income (1 point)
2. Positive ROA (1 point)
3. Positive Operating Cash Flow (1 point)
4. Cash Flow > Net Income (1 point)
5. Lower Long-term Debt (1 point)
6. Higher Current Ratio (1 point)
7. No New Shares Issued (1 point)
8. Higher Gross Margin (1 point)
9. Higher Asset Turnover (1 point)

Score 8-9: Strong
Score 0-2: Weak

### CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS (CDS)

- Market-based measure of credit risk
- CDS spread reflects market's assessment of default probability
- Higher spread indicates higher perceived risk
- Can be used to complement fundamental analysis

### COVENANT ANALYSIS

Common Financial Covenants:
- Minimum EBITDA levels
- Maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratios
- Minimum interest coverage ratios
- Maximum capital expenditure limits
- Restrictions on dividends and share buybacks

### PRACTICAL APPLICATION

[^1]: Start with ratio analysis
[^2]: Apply prediction models
[^3]: Compare with market-based measures
[^4]: Review covenant compliance
[^5]: Form overall credit assessment

### KEY TAKEAWAYS

- Financial risk analysis is critical for lenders and investors
- Multiple tools should be used in combination
- Both historical analysis and forward-looking assessment are important
- Market-based measures can provide additional insights
- Covenant structures are important risk mitigants
