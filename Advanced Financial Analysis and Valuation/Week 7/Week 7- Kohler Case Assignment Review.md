# Week 7- Kohler Case Assignment Review
## File Information

- **Course**: Advanced Financial Analysis and Valuation
- **Week**: 7
- **Topic**: Kohler Case Assignment Review - Private Company Valuation
- **Instructor**: Pervin Shroff
- **Type**: Assignment Review
## Standard of Value in Dispute
The fair value standard under Wisconsin law requires:
- Valuing dissenting shareholders' interest as a proportionate interest in a going concern
- Determining the value $\$a_t$$ which a willing buyer would purchase and a willing seller would sell
- Excluding discounts for minority status or lack of marketability
## Part A: DCF Valuation
### 1. Financial Statement Conversion (2017 to 2018)
Initial calculations show a significant discrepancy:
- 2017 FCF: $133.7M$
- 2018 FCF: $(2,019.0)M$
The major adjustment needed:
- Inventory investment: $3.96 billion$
This extreme increase signals an error in the model. The actual adjustment should be:
- Decrease in Inventories: add back to FCF
### 2. Forecasted FCF Calculations
Correct forecast template:

```
Kohler FCF (in millions)
2019A   2020F   2021F   2022F   2023F   2024F
```

FCF formula:
$\$FCF = EBIAT - \\Delta NWC - CapEx + Depreciation$$

### 3. WACC Calculation
Components:
- Risk-free rate: 2.28%
- Market risk premium: 8.50%
- Beta: Unlevered industry average
- Tax rate: 21%
- Debt/Value ratio: 65.93%
WACC = Cost of Equity × E/(D+E) + Cost of Debt × (1-Tax) × D/(D+E)

### 4. Terminal Value Calculation
TV = FCF2024 × (1+g) / (WACC - g)

Where:
- FCF2024 = Forecasted 2024 FCF
- g = 2% perpetual growth rate
- WACC = Calculated weighted average cost of capital
### 5. Equity Value per Share
Enterprise Value calculation:
- Present Value of FCFs: ∑ FCFt / (1+WACC)^t
- Present Value of Terminal Value: TV / (1+WACC)[^5]
- Total Enterprise Value
Equity Value:
- Enterprise Value - Net Debt = Equity Value
- Equity Value / Shares Outstanding = Value per Share
## Part B: Multiples Valuation
### Public Company Groups
**Group A: All Public Comps**
- Companies: Toto, SHW, GFF, IEX, MAS, Mohawk, MHK
- Metrics: EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, P/E, P/B
**Group B: Japanese and Chinese Comps**
- Companies: Zhongshan, Joyou, Toto, Geberit
- Rationale: Asian market exposure, similar characteristics
**Group C: Luxury Comps**
- Companies: SHW, GFF, IEX
- Rationale: Premium/luxury positioning like Kohler
### Selected Comparison Group: Group C (Luxury)
Reasoning:
- Product positioning alignment
- Brand strength comparability
- Margin profile similarity
- Customer demographics match
## Part C: Kohler Family Valuation Comparison
### A: Willing Seller Perspective
The Kohler family's offer of $55,400/share includes:$
- Base business value
- Control premium
- Going concern value
- No minority discount (fair value standard)
### B: Plaintiff's Position
Dissenting shareholders should assert:
- The terminal growth rate is too conservative
- WACC calculation understates equity value
- Comparable companies suggest higher multiples
- No illiquidity discount should apply
### C: Wisconsin Case Law Analysis
Under Wisconsin law:
- Fair value = Proportionate share of going concern
- Excludes minority discounts
- Must value entire entity then allocate proportionally
- Cannot apply marketability discounts to squeeze out minorities
### D: Current Market Valuation
With A-shares trading $\$a_t$$ $24,500:$
- Market price significantly below fair value estimate
- Reflects minority position and liquidity constraints
- Legal standard should protect against this discount
## Key Takeaways
[^1]: Private company valuation requires careful adjustment of public market data
[^2]: Legal standards significantly impact valuation methodology
[^3]: Control premiums and minority discounts crucial in squeeze-out scenarios
[^4]: Wisconsin fair value standard protects minority shareholders
[^5]: Market price not determinative of fair value in dissenter cases

## Assignment Learning Objectives
- Apply DCF methodology to private company situations
- Understand multiples selection for comparable analysis
- Analyze legal standards' impact on valuation
- Evaluate fair value in minority squeeze-out contexts
- Consider market price vs. intrinsic value distinctions
