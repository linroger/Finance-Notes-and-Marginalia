# Week 7- Kohler Case Assignment Review

## File Information
- **Course**: Advanced Financial Analysis and Valuation
- **Week**: 7
- **Topic**: Kohler Case Assignment Review - Private Company Valuation
- **Instructor**: Pervin Shroff
- **Type**: Assignment Review

## Standard of Value in Dispute

The fair value standard under Wisconsin law requires:
- Valuing dissenting shareholders' interest as a proportionate interest in a going concern
- Determining the value at which a willing buyer would purchase and a willing seller would sell
- Excluding discounts for minority status or lack of marketability

## Part A: DCF Valuation

### 1. Financial Statement Conversion (2017 to 2018)

Initial calculations show a significant discrepancy:
- 2017 FCF: $133.7M
- 2018 FCF: $(2,019.0)M

The major adjustment needed:
- Inventory investment: $3.96 billion

This extreme increase signals an error in the model. The actual adjustment should be:
- Decrease in Inventories: add back to FCF

### 2. Forecasted FCF Calculations

Correct forecast template:

```
Kohler FCF (in millions)
2019A   2020F   2021F   2022F   2023F   2024F
```

FCF formula:
$$FCF = EBIAT - \Delta NWC - CapEx + Depreciation$$

### 3. WACC Calculation

Components:
- Risk-free rate: 2.28%
- Market risk premium: 8.50%
- Beta: Unlevered industry average
- Tax rate: 21%
- Debt/Value ratio: 65.93%

WACC = Cost of Equity × E/(D+E) + Cost of Debt × (1-Tax) × D/(D+E)

### 4. Terminal Value Calculation

TV = FCF2024 × (1+g) / (WACC - g)

Where:
- FCF2024 = Forecasted 2024 FCF
- g = 2% perpetual growth rate
- WACC = Calculated weighted average cost of capital

### 5. Equity Value per Share

Enterprise Value calculation:
- Present Value of FCFs: ∑ FCFt / (1+WACC)^t
- Present Value of Terminal Value: TV / (1+WACC)[^5]
- Total Enterprise Value

Equity Value:
- Enterprise Value - Net Debt = Equity Value
- Equity Value / Shares Outstanding = Value per Share

## Part B: Multiples Valuation

### Public Company Groups

**Group A: All Public Comps**
- Companies: Toto, SHW, GFF, IEX, MAS, Mohawk, MHK
- Metrics: EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, P/E, P/B

**Group B: Japanese and Chinese Comps**
- Companies: Zhongshan, Joyou, Toto, Geberit
- Rationale: Asian market exposure, similar characteristics

**Group C: Luxury Comps**
- Companies: SHW, GFF, IEX
- Rationale: Premium/luxury positioning like Kohler

### Selected Comparison Group: Group C (Luxury)

Reasoning:
- Product positioning alignment
- Brand strength comparability
- Margin profile similarity
- Customer demographics match

## Part C: Kohler Family Valuation Comparison

### A: Willing Seller Perspective

The Kohler family's offer of $55,400/share includes:
- Base business value
- Control premium
- Going concern value
- No minority discount (fair value standard)

### B: Plaintiff's Position

Dissenting shareholders should assert:
- The terminal growth rate is too conservative
- WACC calculation understates equity value
- Comparable companies suggest higher multiples
- No illiquidity discount should apply

### C: Wisconsin Case Law Analysis

Under Wisconsin law:
- Fair value = Proportionate share of going concern
- Excludes minority discounts
- Must value entire entity then allocate proportionally
- Cannot apply marketability discounts to squeeze out minorities

### D: Current Market Valuation

With A-shares trading at $24,500:
- Market price significantly below fair value estimate
- Reflects minority position and liquidity constraints
- Legal standard should protect against this discount

## Key Takeaways

[^1]: Private company valuation requires careful adjustment of public market data
[^2]: Legal standards significantly impact valuation methodology
[^3]: Control premiums and minority discounts crucial in squeeze-out scenarios
[^4]: Wisconsin fair value standard protects minority shareholders
[^5]: Market price not determinative of fair value in dissenter cases

## Assignment Learning Objectives

- Apply DCF methodology to private company situations
- Understand multiples selection for comparable analysis
- Analyze legal standards' impact on valuation
- Evaluate fair value in minority squeeze-out contexts
- Consider market price vs. intrinsic value distinctions
