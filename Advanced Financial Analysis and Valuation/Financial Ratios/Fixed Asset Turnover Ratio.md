# Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio

The fixed asset balance is used as a net of accumulated depreciation. A higher Fixed Asset Turnover ratio indicates a company is making effective use of its fixed asset investments to generate revenue. The ratio provides insights into a company's ability to generate solid profits or cash flows.

- $$\text{Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Revenue}}{\text{Average Fixed Assets}}$$

- $$\text{Average Fixed Assets} = \frac{\text{Beginning Balance} + \text{Ending Balance}}{2}$$

The ratio is commonly used as a metric in manufacturing industries that make substantial purchases of PP&E in order to increase output. When a company makes such significant purchases, wise investors closely monitor this ratio in subsequent years to see if the company's new fixed assets reward it with increased sales.

Overall, investments in fixed assets tend to represent the largest component of the company's total assets. The FAT ratio, calculated annually, is constructed to reflect how efficiently a company, or more specifically, the company's management team, has used these substantial assets to generate revenue for the firm.

## INTERPRETING THE FIXED ASSET TURNOVER RATIO

It is important for analysts and investors to compare a company's most recent ratio to both its own historical ratios and ratio values from peer companies and/or average ratios for the company's industry as a whole.

Though the FAT ratio is of significant importance in certain industries, an investor or analyst must determine whether the company under study is in the appropriate sector or industry for the ratio to be calculated before attaching much weight to it.

Fixed assets vary drastically from one company type to the next. As an example, consider the difference between an internet company and a manufacturing company. An internet company, such as Meta (formerly Facebook), has a significantly smaller fixed asset base than a manufacturing giant, such as Caterpillar. Clearly, in this example, Caterpillar's fixed asset turnover ratio will be more relevant due to its larger investment in property, plant, equipment, capital expenditures and other assets.

A company's asset turnover ratio will be smaller than its fixed asset turnover ratio because the asset turnover ratio includes all assets and not just fixed assets, which are a specific category and a subset of assets.

Manufacturing companies often favor the fixed asset turnover ratio because it helps them determine how efficiently they're using their factory space, equipment, and other capital investments, whereas retail businesses may prefer to know how other assets such as inventory are being utilized.

Because the fixed asset ratio is best used as a comparative tool, it's crucial that the same method of picking information is used across periods.

## LIMITATIONS OF USING THE FIXED ASSET RATIO

Companies with cyclical sales may have worse ratios in slow periods, so the ratio should be looked at during several different time periods. Additionally, management could be outsourcing production to reduce reliance on assets and improve its FAT ratio, while still struggling to maintain stable cash flows and other business fundamentals.

Companies with strong asset turnover ratios can still lose money because the amount of sales generated by fixed assets speak nothing of the company's ability to generate solid profits or healthy cash flow. The fixed asset ratio only looks at net sales and fixed assets; company-wide expenses are not factored into the equation. In addition, there are differences in the cashflow between when net sales are collected and when fixed assets are invested in.

Like other financial ratios, the fixed ratio turnover ratio is only useful as a comparative tool. For instance, a company will gain the most insight when the fixed asset ratio is compared over time to see the trend of how the company is doing. Alternatively, a company can gain insight into their competitors by evaluating how their fixed asset ratio compares to others.

## EXAMPLE OF FIXED ASSET TURNOVER RATIO

Amazon reported fixed assets of $160.3 billion on Dec. 31, 2020, and $177.2 billion on Dec. 31, 2021. In this simplified example, we'll assume these are our starting and ending fixed asset balances. This means Amazon's average fixed assets for this example was $168.75 billion.

Amazon also reported its Net Income for these periods. For the calculation of the fixed asset turnover ratio, we would use Amazon's annual revenue, which in this case is $364.8 billion.
