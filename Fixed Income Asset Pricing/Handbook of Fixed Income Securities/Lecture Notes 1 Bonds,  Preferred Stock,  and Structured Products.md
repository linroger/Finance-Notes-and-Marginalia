# Lecture Notes 1 Bonds,  Preferred Stock,  and Structured Products

## 1. Introduction to Bonds

- Bonds are instruments of debt where the issuer borrows money from the bond investor.
  - The nature of the issuer is a critical characteristic of a bond.
  - Major issuers include domestic corporations,  municipal governments,  and the federal government and its agencies.
	- Domestic corporations can be regulated utilities or less regulated manufacturers.
	- Bonds can be publicly placed or privately placed.
	- Debt can be secured by specific assets or unsecured.
  - Municipal debt includes "general obligation" bonds and "revenue bonds."
	- General obligation bonds are backed by the full faith,  credit,  and taxing power of the issuing government.
	- Revenue bonds depend on the success of specific projects like toll roads or hospitals.
  - The U.S. Treasury and its agencies are significant issuers of debt.
	- Federal agencies include federally related institutions and government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs).
- Exhibit 1-1 provides a breakdown of the U.S. [fixed income](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) market by issuer categories as of December 31,  2019.
  - Treasury: $16,  673.3 billion
  - Mortgage Related: $10,  333.6 billion
  - [Corporate Debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md): $9,  597.8 billion
  - Municipals: $3,  854.5 billion
  - Federal Agency: $1,  825.9 billion
  - [Asset-Backed](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md): $1,  799.3 billion
  - Money Markets: $1,  045.2 billion
  - Total: $32,  996.8 billion
- Different borrowers have developed various ways of raising debt capital,  leading to distinctions among bonds in yield,  denomination,  safety of principal,  maturity,  tax status,  and provisions like call privilege,  put features,  and sinking fund.

## 2. Maturity of a Bond

- The indenture is the legal document setting forth the agreement between bondholders and the issuer.
  - Term-to-maturity refers to the number of years the borrower promises to meet the debt conditions.
  - Maturity denotes the date the bond will be redeemed,  while term or term-to-maturity denotes the remaining years until that date.
  - Maturity is crucial for several reasons:
	- It indicates the expected life of the instrument and the periods for coupon [interest and principal](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) payment.
	- The yield on a bond depends substantially on its maturity.
	- The volatility of a bond's price is closely associated with maturity.
	- Other risks are associated with the maturity of a bond.
- Provisions that modify the maturity of a bond:
  - Call privilege allows the issuer to redeem the bond before the scheduled maturity under certain conditions.
  - Sinking-fund provisions mandate the firm to retire a portion of the debt before maturity.
  - Serial bonds have differing maturities within the same issue.
- Bonds are classified as short-term,  intermediate-term,  and long-term based on maturity:
  - Short-term: 1 to 5 years
  - Intermediate-term: 5 to 12 years
  - Long-term: Greater than 12 years

## 3. Coupon and Principal

- The indenture specifies the interest rate (coupon rate),  payment frequency,  [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  and par value.
  - The coupon rate is the interest rate paid to bondholders during the bond's term.
  - The coupon rate influences the volatility of the bond's price.
  - Interest payments are tax-deductible expenses for corporations.
  - The par value is the amount to be repaid at maturity or when the bond is called or retired.
- Types of coupon structures:
  - Fixed rate or floating/variable rate.
  - Zero-coupon bonds are issued at a price below par value and accrue interest until maturity.
  - [Inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-linked bonds have principal tied to the rate of [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md).
  - Step-up notes have a coupon rate that increases over time.
  - Floating-rate securities have a coupon rate that varies over the instrument's life.
- Reference rates for floating-rate securities:
  - [Basis Swap](A%20Guide%20to%20the%20Front%20End%20and%20[[Basis%20Swaps) Markets#[London Interbank Offered Rate](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Short-Term%20Rates%20and%20the%20Transition%20from%20LIBOR.md) (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] was a common reference rate,  but it is being replaced by alternative rates like SOFR in the U.S.

## 4. Bond Quote Convention

- Bond prices are quoted as percentages of par or face value.
  - To convert the price quote into a dollar figure,  divide the price by 100 and multiply by the par value.

## 5. Embedded Options

- Embedded options grant rights to alter the bond's maturity.
  - Call and refunding provisions allow the issuer to retire the debt before maturity.
  - Sinking-fund provisions require the obligor to retire a portion of the debt each year.
  - Put provisions allow the investor to sell the issue back to the issuer at par value on designated dates.
  - Convertible or exchangeable debt can be exchanged for common stock.
  - Warrants allow bondholders to buy shares of common stock at a specified price.

## 6. Bond Yields

- Bond yields measure the potential return from investing in a bond.
  - Current yield,  yield to maturity,  yield-to-call,  and yield-to-put are common measures.
  - Yield-to-worst is the lowest yield among yield to maturity,  yields to all possible call dates,  and yields to all put dates.
- Government yields have declined due to factors like accommodative [Risk and Return](Lecture%207-[[Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds) of Bonds#7.6 [Asset price](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) reactions to [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) surprises|[monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md)]] and low [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](../Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md).
  - Some government bonds have negative yields due to high purchase prices.

## Example Problems

::: {.callout-note}

#### Example: Bond Price Calculation

Calculate the price of a bond with a par value of $1,  000,  a coupon rate of 5%,  and a yield to maturity of 4% with 10 years remaining to maturity.

1. Calculate the present value of the [coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md).
   - The annual coupon payment is $50 ($1,  000 * 5%).
   - The present value of the [coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) is calculated using the formula for the present value of an annuity.

1. Calculate the present value of the principal repayment.
   - The present value of the principal is calculated using the formula for the present value of a single sum.

1. Sum the present values to find the bond price.
   - The bond price is the sum of the present value of the [coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) and the present value of the principal repayment.

The bond price is calculated as follows:
$$
\text{Bond Price} = \sum_{t=1}^{10} \frac{50}{(1.04)^t} + \frac{1000}{(1.04)^{10}}
$$

The bond price is approximately $1,  081.11.

## Summary

- Bonds are [debt instruments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) with various features and structures,  including maturity,  coupon rates,  and embedded options.
- The nature of the issuer and the bond's characteristics influence its yield,  [price volatility](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Black%20Models%20for%20Bond%20Price%20Options%20Capsfloors.md),  and risk.
- Understanding bond yields and [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) is crucial for investors to assess potential [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) and risks.
- Embedded options and different coupon structures provide flexibility for issuers and investors but also introduce complexity in bond valuation.

The bond price is calculated as follows:
$$
\text{Bond Price} = \sum_{t=1}^{10} \frac{50}{(1.04)^t} + \frac{1000}{(1.04)^{10}}
$$
The bond price is approximately $1,  081.11.
:::

## 7. Medium-Term Notes

- Medium-term notes are highly flexible [debt instruments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) that can be easily structured in response to changing market conditions and investor tastes.
  - "Medium term" is a misnomer because these securities have ranged in maturity from nine months to 30 years and longer.
  - Since the latter part of the 1980s,  medium-term notes have become an increasingly important financing vehicle for corporations and federal agencies.
  - Typically,  medium-term notes are noncallable,  unsecured,  senior [debt securities](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) with fixed-coupon rates that carry an [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade credit rating.
  - They generally differ from other bond offerings in their primary distribution process.
  - Structured medium-term notes,  or simply [structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md),  are [debt instruments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) linked to a derivative position and are discussed in Chapter 12.
	- For example,  [structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) are usually created with an underlying swap transaction.
	- This "[hedging](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) swap" allows the issuer to create securities with interesting risk/return features demanded by bond investors.

## 8. Preferred Stock

- Preferred stock is a class of stock,  not a debt instrument,  but it shares characteristics of both common stock and debt.
  - Like the holder of common stock,  the preferred stockholder is entitled to dividends.
  - Unlike those on common stock,  however,  preferred stock dividends are a specified percentage of par or face value.
	- The percentage is called the dividend rate; it need not be fixed but may float over the life of the issue.
	- Failure to make preferred stock [dividend payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) cannot force the issuer into bankruptcy.
	- Should the issuer not make the preferred stock dividend payment,  usually paid quarterly,  one of two things can happen,  depending on the terms of the issue.
	  - First,  the dividend payment can accrue until it is fully paid.
		- Preferred stock with this feature is called cumulative preferred stock.
	  - Second,  if a dividend payment is missed and the security holder must forgo the payment,  the preferred stock is said to be noncumulative preferred stock.
		- Failure to make [dividend payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) may result in the imposition of certain restrictions on management.
		- For example,  if [dividend payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) are in arrears,  preferred stockholders might be granted voting rights.
  - Unlike debt,  payments made to preferred stockholders are treated as a distribution of earnings.
	- This means that they are not tax-deductible to the corporation under the current tax code.
	- Interest payments,  on the other hand,  are tax-deductible.
	- Although the after-tax cost of funds is higher if a corporation issues preferred stock rather than borrowing,  there is a factor that reduces the cost differential.
	  - A provision in the tax code exempts 70% of qualified dividends from federal income taxation if the recipient is a qualified corporation.
		- For example,  if Corporation A owns the preferred stock of Corporation B,  for each $100 of dividends received by A,     only $30 will be taxed at A's marginal tax rate.
		- The purpose of this provision is to mitigate the effect of double taxation of corporate earnings.
	- There are two implications of this tax treatment of preferred stock dividends.
	  - First,  the major buyers of preferred stock are corporations seeking tax-advantaged investments.
	  - Second,  the cost of preferred stock issuance is lower than it would be in the absence of the tax provision because the tax benefits are passed through to the issuer by the willingness of buyers to accept a lower dividend rate.
  - Preferred stock has some important similarities with debt,  particularly in the case of cumulative preferred stock.
	- The payments to preferred stockholders promised by the issuer are fixed.
	- Preferred stockholders have priority over common stockholders with respect to [dividend payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) and distribution of assets in the case of bankruptcy.
	  - The position of noncumulative preferred stock is considerably weaker than cumulative preferred stock.
	  - It is because of this second feature that preferred stock is called a senior security.
	  - It is senior to common stock.
  - On a balance sheet,  preferred stock is classified as equity.
  - Preferred stock may be issued without a maturity date.
	- This is called perpetual preferred stock.
	- Almost all preferred stock has a sinking-fund provision,  and some preferred stock is convertible into common stock.
	- A trademark product of [Morgan Stanley](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md) is the Preferred Equity Redemption Cumulative Stock (PERCS).
	  - This is a preferred stock with a mandatory conversion at maturity.

## 9. Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS)

- A residential mortgage-backed security (RMBS) is an instrument whose [cash flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) depends on the cash flows of an underlying pool of mortgages.
  - In the U.S. market,  RMBS are classified into two groups: agency RMBS and nonagency RMBS.
	- An agency RMBS,  the subject of Chapter 22,  is one issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae),  the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"),  or the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae").
	  - Ginnie Mae is a federal government agency within the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
	  - The RMBS issued by this entity is guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.
	  - Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are GSEs.
	  - In September 2008,  these two entities were placed into conservatorship run by the Federal Housing Finance Agency.
	  - The agency RMBS market is the second largest sector of the U.S. bond market as of year-end 2019.
	  - In bond indexes such as the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index,  this sector is referred to as simply “[mortgage-backed securities](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Fremont%20Financial%20Corp.%20(b).md)" or the “MBS" sector despite the fact that there are also private-label RMBS.
	- Private-label RMBS,  also referred to as nonagency RMBS and the subject of Chapter 25,  are issued by thrifts,  commercial banks,  or private conduits that are not backed by any government entity.
	  - These securities are structured so as to provide [credit enhancement](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%20On%20Securitization(1).md) that supports the credit ratings that they receive.
	  - Up to the Great [Financial Crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) of 2008-2009,  the private-label RMBS market was divided into two sectors: prime RMBS and [subprime RMBS](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Moodys%20Structured%20Finance%20Rating%20Methodology%20Subprime%20RMBS%20Loss%20Projection%20Update,%20%20March%202009.md).
	  - The classification depended on the [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) of the pool of borrowers and the type of lien on the properties that were mortgaged.
	  - The primary attribute used to categorize the borrower’s [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) has long been the borrower’s Fair Isaacs or FICO credit score or any one of other related measures that are not discussed here (e.g.,  an income ratio indicating the borrower’s ability to pay and the loan-to-value ratio measuring the borrower's equity in the property).
	  - Prime borrowers are generally those with FICO scores of 660 or higher.
	  - Subprime borrowers are those with impaired credit ratings,  typically with FICO scores below 660.
	  - However,  because of the difficulties faced in the RMBS subprime market that started in the summer of 2007,  and the poor performance of the collateral underlying both prime and [subprime RMBS](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Moodys%20Structured%20Finance%20Rating%20Methodology%20Subprime%20RMBS%20Loss%20Projection%20Update,%20%20March%202009.md),  investors no longer draw a sharp distinction between these two sectors of the private-label RMBS market.
  - RMBS can take three forms: (1) mortgage pass-through securities,  (2) [collateralized mortgage obligations](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Other%20MBS.md) (CMOs),  and (3) stripped [mortgage-backed securities](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Fremont%20Financial%20Corp.%20(b).md).
	- Agency RMBS come in all three forms.
	- Typically,  private-label RMBS come only in the second form and,  as a result,  this sector of the market is referred to as the private-label CMO market.
  - Agency RMBS expose an investor to [prepayment risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Risk%20Factors%20and%20Hedging%20Agency%20MBS.md).
	- This is the risk that the borrowers in a [mortgage pool](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Mortgage%20Pools.md) will prepay their loans when [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) decline.
	- [Prepayment risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Risk%20Factors%20and%20Hedging%20Agency%20MBS.md) is effectively the same as call risk faced by an investor in a callable corporate or municipal bond.
  - Private-label RMBS expose investors to both [prepayment risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Risk%20Factors%20and%20Hedging%20Agency%20MBS.md) and [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md),  although the major concern by investors in this space is [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md).

## 10. Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS)

- Commercial [mortgage-backed securities](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Fremont%20Financial%20Corp.%20(b).md) (CMBSs) are backed by a pool of commercial mortgage loans on income-producing property—multifamily properties (i.e.,  apartment buildings),  office buildings,  industrial properties (including warehouses),  shopping centers,  hotels,  and health care facilities (i.e.,  senior housing care facilities).
  - The basic building block of the CMBS transaction is a commercial loan that was originated either to finance a commercial purchase or to refinance a prior mortgage obligation.
  - There are two major types of CMBS deal structures that have been of interest to bond investors: multi-property single borrowers and multi-property conduits.
  - The fastest-growing segment of the CMBS is conduit-originated transactions.
	- Conduits are commercial-lending entities that are established for the sole purpose of generating collateral to securitize.
  - Unlike residential mortgage loans,  where the lender relies on the ability of the borrower to repay and has recourse to the borrower if the payment terms are not satisfied,  commercial mortgage loans are nonrecourse loans.
	- This means that the lender can only look to the income-producing property backing the loan for [interest and principal](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) repayment.
	- If there is a default,  the lender looks to the proceeds from the sale of the property for repayment and has no recourse to the borrower for any unpaid balance.
	- Basically,  this means that the lender must view each property as a stand-alone business and evaluate each property using measures that have been found useful in assessing [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md).

## 11. Asset-Backed Securities

- [Asset-backed](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) securities are securities collateralized by assets that are not mortgage loans.
  - In structuring an [asset-backed](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) security,  issuers have drawn from the structures used in the [mortgage-backed securities market](../Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%201-Introduction%20To%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md).
  - [Asset-backed](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) securities have been structured as [pass-throughs](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%209%20-%20Mortgage-Backed%20Securities/Mortgage%20Pass-Through%20Securities.md) and as structures with multiple bond classes called pay-throughs,  which are similar to CMOs.
  - [Credit enhancement](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%20On%20Securitization(1).md) is provided by letters of credit,  over-collateralization,  or senior/subordination.
  - Three common types of [asset-backed](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) securities are those backed by credit card receivables,  home equity loans,  and automobile loans.
	- Chapters 28 and 29 cover these securities.
  - There are also [asset-backed](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) securities supported by a pool of manufactured homes,  Small Business Administration (SBA) loans,  student loans,  boat loans,  equipment leases,  recreational vehicle loans,  senior bank loans,  and possibly,  the future royalties of your favorite entertainer.

## 12. Covered Bonds

- In the wake of the [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) of 2008-2009,  a bond structure very familiar to European investors—covered bonds—was touted as an alternative funding source for residential mortgage loans.
  - Collateral in the typical European covered bond includes residential/commercial mortgages and public sector debt.
  - A covered bond is a debt instrument secured by a specific pool of collateralizing assets.
  - Covered bonds,  the subject of Chapter 26,  differ from the typical mortgage-backed security issued in the United States on a number of dimensions.
	- First,  the cover pool remains on the issuer's balance sheet rather than being sold to a special-purpose entity.
	- Second,  the mortgages in the cover pool serve only as collateral for investors,  whereas the covered bond’s principal and interest are serviced by the issuer's cash flows.
	- Third,  [mortgage-backed securities](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Fremont%20Financial%20Corp.%20(b).md) are claims to static pools,  whereas the cover pool is dynamic,  and nonperforming mortgages must be replaced with performing ones.
	- Fourth,  unlike MBS,  covered bonds are structured to prevent prepayments before maturity.
	- Finally,  investors in covered bonds retain an unsecured claim on the issuer for any shortfall due to them (i.e.,  unpaid principal and interest).

## 13. Beyond Traditional Liquid Fixed Income Instruments

- Before the Great [Financial Crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) of 2008-2009,  the traditional liquid [fixed income](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) market was the place for investors to get interest rate and credit exposure.
  - Regulatory changes,  pressures on banks to rebuild their capital and keep their balance sheet lean,  as well as the secular decline in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) gave a boost to the rise of private credit since then.
  - Private credit is usually mentioned within the context of alternative credit.
	- The concept of alternative credit is very broad and covers a wide range of strategies—including liquid investments like below-[investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade corporate and securitized bonds,  as well as less liquid or illiquid strategies like direct lending,  [nonperforming loans](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/The%20Workout%20Crew.md),  and distressed credit.
  - Private direct lending grew as a result of banks lending less than before the crisis,  while borrowers who could not access the public market are still in need of funding.
	- Private debt borrowers can be grouped into residential (e.g.,  nonqualified mortgage borrowers),  commercial real estate (e.g.,  commercial real estate whole loans),  corporate (e.g.,  middle market direct lending,  mezzanine lending),  and other categories (e.g.,  trade finance).
	- By investing in private credit,  investors can take advantage of higher [expected return](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) since these opportunities reside in less efficient markets,  as well as demanding an additional illiquidity premium.
	- Compared to traditional bond investments when a [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) manager is buying and selling publicly traded securities,  the fund manager of private credit strategies has more direct control over the lending decisions,  and,  if necessary,  is actively involved in the workout process.
	- Investors can get exposure to alternative credit either in a hedge fund structure or in a drawdown structure as private direct lending fund limited partners.

## 14. Key Points

- Bonds differ on a number of dimensions,  which include type of issuer,  maturity,  coupon,  [principal amount](../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/HSBC-Auto%20callable%20Barrier%20Notes%20with%20Step-up%20Premium.md),  method of redemption,  and embedded options.
- Embedded options in a debt instrument are call and refunding provisions,  prepayment provisions,  optional accelerated provision,  put provision,  and conversion provision.
- Medium-term notes are highly flexible [debt instruments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) that can be easily structured in response to changing market conditions and investor tastes.
- [Structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) are [debt instruments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) that are linked to a derivative position and allow an issuer to create a customized debt instrument for an investor.
- Preferred stock is a security that shares characteristics of [debt and equity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/I-%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20Markets%20and%20Intermediation/I-%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20Markets%20and%20Intermediation/Class%20Note%201-%20Borrower-Lender%20conflicts%20and%20implied%20agency%20problems.md).
- Residential RMBS are classified into agency and private-label (also called nonagency) securities.
- There are three types of RMBS: (1) [pass-throughs](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%209%20-%20Mortgage-Backed%20Securities/Mortgage%20Pass-Through%20Securities.md),  (2) [collateralized mortgage obligations](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Other%20MBS.md) (CMOs),  and (3) stripped [mortgage-backed securities](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Fremont%20Financial%20Corp.%20(b).md).
- Private-label RMBS typically have the CMO structure.
- [Asset-backed](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) securities are collateralized by financial assets other than residential mortgages.
- A covered bond is a debt instrument secured by a specific pool of collateral called a collateral pool and remains on the balance sheet of the issuer.
- Alternative credit covers a wide range of strategies such as including liquid investments like below-[investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade corporate and securitized bonds,  as well as less liquid or illiquid strategies like direct lending,  [nonperforming loans](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/The%20Workout%20Crew.md),  and distressed credit.

## 15. Risks Associated with Investing in Fixed Income Securities

- The return obtained from a [fixed income](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) security from the day it is purchased to the day it is sold can be divided into two parts: (1) the change in market value of the security when it is eventually sold and (2) the cash flows received from the security over the time period that it is held,  plus any additional income from reinvestment of the [cash flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md).
  - Several environmental factors affect one or both of these two parts.
  - We can define the risk associated with any security as a measure of the impact of these factors on the return characteristics of the security.
  - The different types of risk that an investor in individual [fixed income securities](../../Clippings/Bond%20Equivalent%20Yield%20(BEY)%20-%20Definition,%20Formula,%20and%20Example.md) is exposed to are as follows:
	- Interest-rate risk
	- Reinvestment risk
	- Call/[prepayment risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Risk%20Factors%20and%20Hedging%20Agency%20MBS.md)
	- [Credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md)
	- [Inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md),  or purchasing-power,  risk
	- [Liquidity risk](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md)
	- Exchange-rate,  or [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  risk
	- Volatility risk
	- Political or legal risk
	- Event risk
	- Sector risk
  - There are also risks associated with bond [portfolio strategies](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md).
	- These include statistical measures of [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) risk and tracking error risk.
	- Each risk is briefly described in this chapter.
	- A more detailed description of these risks is provided in the chapters that follow.
	- To manage a bond [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md),  it is important that a manager be able to quantify these risks.
	- In later chapters,  multifactor [risk models](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%204.md) for building and controlling a [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)'s risk profile relative to a bond index or benchmark will be described.
	- These models depend crucially on the ability to measure the primary [risk factors](../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/PSET%206-%20Financial%20Instruments.md).
	- Although not all of the risks described in this chapter are quantifiable,  the primary [risk factors](../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/PSET%206-%20Financial%20Instruments.md) associated with any bond index and [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) can be quantified.
	- The key in active bond [portfolio management](../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/The%20Impact%20of%20Option%20Strategies%20in%20Financial%20%20Portfolios%20Performance.md) in which the investor's benchmark is a bond index is to quantify the major [risk factors](../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/PSET%206-%20Financial%20Instruments.md) so that a [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) manager who seeks to take a view on some or all of the primary [risk factors](../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/PSET%206-%20Financial%20Instruments.md) can do so by constructing a [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) with a targeted risk profile relative to the benchmark.
	- In the case of passive bond [portfolio management](../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/The%20Impact%20of%20Option%20Strategies%20in%20Financial%20%20Portfolios%20Performance.md),  the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) manager seeks to match the risk profile of the benchmark.

## 16. Interest-Rate Risk

- Interest-rate risk is the risk associated with an adverse change in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).
  - This risk includes two types of risk: level risk and yield-curve risk.
  - In multifactor [risk models](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%204.md) described in later chapters,  interest-rate risk is referred to as yield-curve risk or [term structure](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) risk.

### Level Risk

- The price of a typical [fixed income](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) security moves in the opposite direction of the change in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md): as [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) rise (fall),  the price of a [fixed income](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) security will fall (rise).
  - This property is illustrated in Chapter 4.
  - For an investor who plans to hold a [fixed income](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) security to maturity,  the change in its price before maturity is not of concern,  although a decline in the security's market value reflects on the opportunity cost of not investing at a higher yield; however,  for an investor who may have to sell the [fixed income](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) security before the maturity date,  an increase in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) will mean the realization of a capital loss.
  - This risk is referred to as interest-rate risk,  which is one of the primary risks faced by an investor in the [fixed income](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) market.
  - It is customary to represent the market by the yield levels on [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md).
  - Most other yields are compared to the Treasury levels and are quoted as spreads off appropriate Treasury yields.
  - To the extent that the yields of all [fixed income securities](../../Clippings/Bond%20Equivalent%20Yield%20(BEY)%20-%20Definition,%20Formula,%20and%20Example.md) are interrelated,  their prices respond to changes in Treasury rates.
  - As discussed in Chapter 5,  the actual magnitude of the price response for any security depends on various characteristics of the security,  such as coupon,  maturity,  and the options embedded in the security (e.g.,  [call and put](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/Notes%20on%20Basic%20Options%20Properties.md) provisions).
  - To control interest-rate risk,  it is necessary to quantify it.
  - The most commonly used measure of interest-rate risk is [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md).
	- [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) is the approximate percentage change in the price of a bond or bond [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) due to a 100-basis point change in yields.
	- This measure and how it is computed is explained in Chapter 5.

### Yield-Curve Risk

- The yield curve is the graphic depiction of the relationship between the yield on bonds of the same [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) but different maturities.
  - The yield curve,  and a related relationship called the [term structure of interest rates](../../Financial%20Engineering/6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md),  will be discussed in more detail in later chapters.
  - A bond [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) typically contains holdings with different maturities and each bond is subject to interest-rate risk.
  - So,  for example,  consider two bond portfolios both consisting of three bonds: a 5-year bond,  a 10-year bond,  and a 20-year bond.
  - The exposure of that [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) depends on how [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) change for each of the maturities.
  - Suppose the first bond [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) has 45% in both the 5-year and 20-year bonds and 10% in the 10-year bond.
  - Suppose that the second bond [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) has 5% in both the 5-year and 20-year bonds and 90% in the 10-year bond.
  - It is not difficult to understand that the way in which [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) change on the yield curve can have a substantially different impact on the change in these two bond portfolios.
  - Yield-curve risk is the exposure of a [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) to changes in the shape (i.e.,  movement) of the yield curve.
  - There are various measures that have been suggested for quantifying a [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)’s exposure to changes in the yield curve.
  - The most common measure used is [key rate](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md).
  - Yield-curve risk is an important risk in bond [portfolio management](../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/The%20Impact%20of%20Option%20Strategies%20in%20Financial%20%20Portfolios%20Performance.md),  and with the exception of [mortgage-backed securities](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Fremont%20Financial%20Corp.%20(b).md) in which case refinancing risk could impact cohorts of MBS with various coupons and seasoning to a different degree,  it is primarily a risk that must be dealt with at the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) level.

## 17. Reinvestment Risk

- As explained in Chapter 4,  the cash flows received from a security are usually (or are assumed to be) reinvested.
  - The additional income from such reinvestment,  sometimes called interest-on-interest,  depends on the prevailing interest-rate levels at the time of reinvestment,  as well as on the reinvestment strategy.
  - The variability in the [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) from reinvestment from a given strategy due to changes in market rates is called reinvestment risk.
  - The risk here is that the interest rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested will fall.
  - Reinvestment risk is greater for longer holding periods.
  - It is also greater for securities with large,  early cash flows such as high-coupon bonds.
  - This risk is analyzed in more detail in Chapter 4.
  - It should be noted that interest-rate risk and reinvestment risk oppose each other.
	- For example,  interest-rate risk is the risk that [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) will rise,  thereby reducing the price of a [fixed income](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) security.
	- In contrast,  reinvestment risk is the risk that [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) will fall.

## 18. Call/Prepayment Risk

- As explained in Chapter 1,  bonds may contain a provision that allows the issuer to retire,  or “call,  ” all or part of the issue before the maturity date.
  - By including this provision,  the issuer retains the right to refinance the bond in the future if market [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) decline below the coupon rate.
  - From the investor's perspective,  there are three disadvantages of the call provision and hence faces call risk.
	- First,  the cash-flow pattern of a callable bond is not known with certainty.
	- Second,  because the issuer may call the bonds when [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) have dropped,  the investor is exposed to reinvestment risk.
	  - That is,  the investor will have to reinvest the proceeds received when the bond is called at lower [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).
	- Finally,  the capital appreciation potential of a bond will be reduced because the price of a callable bond may not rise much above the price at which the issuer may call the bond.
	  - We describe this property of a callable bond,  referred to as [negative convexity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Mortgage%20Pricing%20Spreads%20and%20Duration.md),  in Chapter 4.
  - Agency,  corporate,  and municipal bonds may have embedded in them the option on the part of the borrower to call,  or terminate,  the issue before the stated maturity date.
  - All [mortgage-backed securities](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Fremont%20Financial%20Corp.%20(b).md) have this option.
  - Even though the investor is usually compensated for taking the risk of call by means of a lower price or a higher yield,  it is not easy to determine if this compensation is sufficient.
  - In any case,  the [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) from a bond with call risk can be dramatically different from those obtained from a noncallable bond.
  - The magnitude of this risk depends on the various parameters of the call,  as well as on market conditions.
  - In the case of [mortgage-backed securities](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Fremont%20Financial%20Corp.%20(b).md),  the [cash flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) depends on prepayments of principal made by the homeowners in the pool of mortgages that is the collateral for the security.
  - Call risk in this case is called [prepayment risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Risk%20Factors%20and%20Hedging%20Agency%20MBS.md).
	- It includes contraction risk—the risk that homeowners will prepay all or part of their mortgage when mortgage [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) decline.
	- The risk that prepayments will slow down when mortgage [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) rise and force an investor who expected that the pool of mortgages would prepay at a faster rate is called extension risk.

## 19. Corporate Credit Risk

- The [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) of a bond includes:
  1. The risk that the issuer will default on its obligation.
  2. The risk that the bond’s value will decline and/or the bond’s price performance will be worse than that of other bonds against which the investor is compared because either (a) the market requires a higher spread due to a perceived increase in the risk that the issuer will default or (b) companies that assign ratings to bonds will lower a bond’s rating.
	- The first risk is referred to as [default risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md).
	- The second risk is labeled based on the reason for the adverse or inferior performance.
	  - The risk attributable to an increase in the spread or,  more specifically,  the [credit spread](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) demanded by the market,  is referred to as credit-spread risk.
	  - The risk attributable to a lowering of the credit rating (i.e.,  a downgrading) is referred to as downgrade risk.
  - Credit-risk-bearing bonds are traded at higher yield levels than presumably credit-risk-free government bonds with similar maturity.
	- This [credit spread](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) offers investors with (1) protection against credit default,  and (2) extra yield compensation against taking [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md).
	- In case no [credit event](../../Financial%20Engineering/Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) happens,  such as default or downgrade,  the investor would ideally harvest all the [credit spread](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) as excess return over government bonds.
	- At the other extreme,  in a theoretical “[risk-neutral world](../../Financial%20Instruments/Binomial%20Option%20Pricing%20Model.md),  ” investors would not require extra compensation for risk-taking,  so all the spread would simply compensate realized credit losses.
	- In practice,  the reality is somewhere in between these two extremes: credit events happen,  reducing the excess return relative to the initial credit spreads,  but over the long term,  credit spreads still turn into some excess return for a well-diversified long-term credit investor.
	- Rising [credit spread](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) levels,  nevertheless,  reflect increased expectation of coming credit losses,  as well as more elevated risk aversion.
	- In a [risk-neutral world](../../Financial%20Instruments/Binomial%20Option%20Pricing%20Model.md),  a one-year [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md)-bearing bond,  say 2% probability of default with zero [recovery rate](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%203.md),  would be fairly “compensated” with a 2.1% spread (or about 1.0% with a 50% [recovery rate](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%203.md)).
	- However,  should default happen,  the 100% loss on a single bond would be devastating,  so diversification is critical for a corporate bond [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).
	- Note,  however,  that the average spread level of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Corporate Bond index has been 1.34% from January 1988 to May 2020,  whereas the default rate of [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade bonds has stayed below 0.5% every year (0.1% per year on average) between 1981 and 2019 based on S&P Global Rating reports.
	- This suggests that credit spreads offer extra compensation to investors beyond covering credit losses over the long term.
  - A credit rating is a formal opinion given by a specialized company of the [default risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md) faced by investing in a particular issue of [debt securities](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md).
	- The specialized companies that provide credit ratings are referred to as rating agencies.
	- The three nationally recognized rating agencies in the United States are Moody's Investors Service,  Standard & Poor’s Corporation,  and Fitch Ratings.
	- The symbols used by these rating agencies and a summary description of each rating are given in Chapter 10.
	- Once a credit rating is assigned to a debt obligation,  a rating agency monitors the [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) of the issuer and can reassign a different credit rating to its bonds.
	- An “upgrade” occurs when there is an improvement in the [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) of an issue; a “downgrade” occurs when there is a deterioration in the [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) of an issue.
	- As noted earlier,  downgrade risk is the risk that an issue will be downgraded.
	- Typically,  before an issue's rating is changed,  the rating agency will announce in advance that it is reviewing the issue with the potential for upgrade or downgrade.
	- The issue in such cases is said to be on “rating watch” or “credit watch.”
	- In the announcement,  the rating agency will state the direction of the potential change in rating—upgrade or downgrade.
	- Typically,  a decision will be made within three months.
	- In addition,  rating agencies will issue rating outlooks.
	- A rating outlook is a projection of whether an issue in the long term (from six months to two years) is likely to be upgraded,  be downgraded,  or maintain its current rating.
	- Rating agencies designate a rating outlook as either positive (i.e.,  likely to be upgraded),  negative (i.e.,  likely to be downgraded),  or stable (i.e.,  likely to be no change in the rating).

## 20. Gauging Default Risk and Downgrade Risk

- The information available to investors from rating agencies about [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) are (1) ratings,  (2) rating watches or credit watches,  and (3) rating outlooks.
  - A study by Moody’s found that for [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md),  its ratings combined with its rating watches and rating outlook status provide a better gauge for [default risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md) than using the ratings alone.
  - Moreover,  periodic studies by the rating agencies provide information to investors about [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md).
  - Below we describe how the information provided by rating agencies can be used to gauge two forms of [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md): [default risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md) and downgrade risk.
  - For long-term debt obligations,  a credit rating is a forward-looking assessment of (1) the probability of default and (2) the relative magnitude of the loss should a default occur.
  - For [short-term debt](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/When%20Safe%20Proved%20Risky%20Commercial%20Paper%20During%20the%20Financial%20Crisis%20of%202007%202009.md) obligations (i.e.,  obligations with initial maturities of one year or less),  a credit rating is a forward-looking assessment of the probability of default.
  - Consequently,  credit ratings are the rating agencies' assessments of the [default risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md) associated with a bond issue.
  - Periodic studies by rating agencies provide information about two aspects of [default risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md)—[default rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Default%20Rates%20Recovery%20Rates%20and%20Credit%20Losses.md) and default loss rates.
  - First,  rating agencies study and make available to investors the percentage of bonds of a given rating at the beginning of a period that have defaulted at the end of the period.
  - This percentage is referred to as the default rate.
  - A default loss rate is a measure of the magnitude of the potential of the loss should a default occur.
  - Rating transition tables published periodically by rating agencies also provide information.
  - A rating transition table shows the percentage of issues of each rating at the beginning of a period that were downgraded or upgraded by the end of the time period.
  - Consequently,  by looking at the percentage of downgrades for a given rating,  an estimate can be obtained of the probability of a downgrade,  and this can serve as a measure of downgrade risk.

## 21. Credit Risk Models

- Beyond credit ratings,  [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) managers are employing other methodologies for estimating the [Probability Distributions](Lecture%201-%20[[Exercises) of [Returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md)|probability distribution]] of losses for a bond [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in order to compute loss measures such as value at risk (VaR) and conditional VaR (CVaR).
  - For banks,  there have been changes in the supervisory framework,  as put forward in the Basel II Capital Accord,  that require new tools and concepts for measuring [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) and the development of an internal rating system (IRB),  as well as the collection of detailed data on credit exposures and recovery rates.
  - These new tools and concepts will aid banks in evaluating and managing their [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) profile.
  - Models for credit risks have long existed in the actuarial and [corporate finance](../../Course%20Notes/Corporate%20Finance%20Lecture%20Notes.md) literatures.
  - The traditional models concentrate on [default rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Default%20Rates%20Recovery%20Rates%20and%20Credit%20Losses.md),  credit ratings,  and [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) premiums and focus on diversification,  making the assumption that default risks are idiosyncratic and hence can be diversified away in large portfolios.
  - For single isolated credits,  the models calculate risk premiums as markups onto the [risk-free rate](../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md).
  - Since the mid-1990s,  however,  there have been major advances in modeling [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) for estimating the [Probability Distributions](Lecture%201-%20[[Exercises) of [Returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md)|probability distribution]] of losses for a bond [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).
  - The models are divided into three categories: [structural models](../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Credit%20Risk%20Models%20and%20the%20Valuation%20of%20Credit%20%20Default%20Swap%20Contracts.md),  [reduced-form models](../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Credit%20Risk%20Models%20and%20the%20Valuation%20of%20Credit%20%20Default%20Swap%20Contracts.md),  and incomplete-information models.
  - Each of these models is described in Chapter 42.

## 22. Sovereign Credit Risk

- While we often speak about government bonds in terms of “risk-free” assets,  in reality,  sovereign issuers are not free of [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) either.
  - Sovereign [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) has periodically become a concern,  and while over the past decades,  government defaults were mainly associated with developing and emerging countries,  government balance sheets of developed markets can come under pressure as well.
  - Governments in the United States and across Europe have accumulated significant debt by stimulating the economy after the [Global Financial Crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md),  and would potentially add to the sovereign debt as a result of the additional stimulus packages that have been introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  - Sovereign debt covers the outstanding debt obligations of the federal government,  central administration,  local governments,  and all entities that borrow with an explicit guarantee from the government.
  - Sovereign [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) is the possibility that the government may default on its debt,  thus it fails to service its [interest and principal](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) payment obligations in a timely manner.
  - As discussed in the previous section in the context of corporate [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md),  sovereign [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) can also impact investors by not only losing all or more typically part of the principal,  but in many other forms as well.
  - [Credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) may manifest in [Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy](Class%20Slide%204-[[Class%20Slide%204-Restructuring%20Debt%20Outside%20Bankruptcy)|[Debt Restructuring](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Class%20Slide%204-Restructuring%20Debt%20Outside%20Bankruptcy.md) ]] by credit downgrade,  or significant spread widening as the market is anticipating a default.
  - While the concept of a credit default in principle is the same for sovereigns and corporate issuers,  sovereign borrowers and corporations also differ in many respects.
  - In the case of sovereigns,  a default occurs either because the borrower is not able to repay its debt,  or particularly in the case of local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt,  because it is unwilling to service its obligation.
  - Sovereigns,  unlike corporations,  do not go bankrupt,  and a sovereign default may be a result of choice,  by taking political and social as well as economic and financial consequences into account.
  - With that in mind,  why are investors willing to lend money to sovereigns?
	- Unlike in the case of [corporate debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md),  there are very limited legal means to reinforce the contract,  especially in the case of domestic debt.
	- Still,  there are several incentives for a government to honor its debt.
	  - First,  a default hugely deteriorates a country’s market access and reputation and makes future borrowings particularly difficult and expensive.
	  - Second,  a default can very negatively impact trade relations with other countries,  and broad international relations and alliances can be also damaged by a default.

## 23. Inflation,  or Purchasing-Power,  Risk

- [Inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) risk,  or purchasing-power risk,  arises because of the variation in the value of cash flows from a security due to [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md),  as measured in terms of purchasing power.
  - For example,  if an investor purchases a five-year bond in which he or she can realize a coupon rate of 7%,  but the rate of [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) is 8%,  then the purchasing power of the [cash flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) has declined.
  - For all but [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-linked securities (sometimes referred to as “linkers"),  an investor is exposed to [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) risk because the interest rate the issuer promises to make is fixed for the life of the security.
  - To the extent that [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) reflect the [expected inflation rate](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md),  floating-rate bonds have a lower level of [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) risk than fixed-rate bonds.

## 24. Liquidity Risk

- [Liquidity risk](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) is the risk that the investor will have to sell a bond below its true value where the true value is indicated by a recent transaction.
  - The primary measure of [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) is the size of the spread between the bid price and the ask price quoted by a dealer.
  - The wider the bid/ask spread,  the greater is the [liquidity risk](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md).
  - A liquid market generally can be defined by “small bid/ask spreads which do not materially increase for large transactions."
  - How to define the bid/ask spread in a multiple-dealer market is subject to interpretation.
  - For example,  consider the bid/ask spread for four dealers.
	- Each quote is for 92 plus the number of 32nds shown:
	  - Dealer 1: Bid price = 1,  Ask price = 4
	  - Dealer 2: Bid price = 1,  Ask price = 3
	  - Dealer 3: Bid price = 2,  Ask price = 4
	  - Dealer 4: Bid price = 2,  Ask price = 5
	- The bid/ask spread for each dealer (in 32nds) is:
	  - Dealer 1: 3
	  - Dealer 2: 2
	  - Dealer 3: 2
	  - Dealer 4: 3
	- The best bid/ask spread is two 32nds for Dealers 2 and 3.
	- From the perspective of the market overall,  the bid/ask spread can be computed by looking at the best bid price (high price at which one of the dealers is willing to buy the security) and the lowest ask price (lowest offer price at which one of the dealers is willing to sell the security).
	- This [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) measure is called the market bid/ask spread.
	- For the four dealers,  the highest bid price is 92 plus two 32nds and the lowest ask price is 92 plus three 32nds.
	- Thus,  the market bid/ask spread is one 32nd.
  - For investors who plan to hold a bond until maturity and need not mark a position to market,  [liquidity risk](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) is not a major concern.
  - An institutional investor who plans to hold an issue to maturity but is periodically marked to market is concerned with [liquidity risk](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md).
  - By marking a position to market,  it is meant that the security is revalued in the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) based on its current market price.
  - For example,  mutual funds are required to [mark to market](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) at the end of each day the holdings that are in their [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in order to compute the net asset value (NAV).
  - While other [institutional investors](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%204%20Institutional%20Trading.md) may not [mark to market](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) as frequently as mutual funds,  they are marked to market when reports are periodically sent to clients or the board of directors or trustees.
  - Where are the prices obtained to mark a position to market?
	- Typically,  a [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) manager will solicit indicative bids from several dealers and then use some process to determine the bid price used to mark the position.
	- The less liquid the issue,  the greater the variation there will be in the bid prices obtained from dealers.

## Summary

- Bonds are [debt instruments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) with various features and structures,  including maturity,  coupon rates,  and embedded options.
- The nature of the issuer and the bond's characteristics influence its yield,  [price volatility](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Black%20Models%20for%20Bond%20Price%20Options%20Capsfloors.md),  and risk.

- Embedded options and different coupon structures provide flexibility for issuers and investors but also introduce complexity in bond valuation.
- Preferred stock,  while not a debt instrument,  shares characteristics with both [debt and equity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/I-%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20Markets%20and%20Intermediation/I-%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20Markets%20and%20Intermediation/Class%20Note%201-%20Borrower-Lender%20conflicts%20and%20implied%20agency%20problems.md),  offering unique [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) opportunities and tax considerations.
- [Mortgage-backed securities](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Fremont%20Financial%20Corp.%20(b).md),  both residential and commercial,  offer exposure to real estate markets but come with specific risks such as prepayment and [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md).
- [Asset-backed](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) securities and covered bonds provide additional avenues for [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md),  each with its own [risk and return](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds.md) profile.
- The rise of private credit and alternative credit strategies reflects changes in the financial landscape post-2008,  offering higher [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) but with increased complexity and risk.
- Investors must be aware of the various risks associated with [fixed income securities](../../Clippings/Bond%20Equivalent%20Yield%20(BEY)%20-%20Definition,%20Formula,%20and%20Example.md),  including interest-rate risk,  reinvestment risk,  [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md),  and [liquidity risk](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md),  among others.

# Lecture Notes: Risks and the Structure of Interest Rates

## 1. Introduction to Market Liquidity

- [Market liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Trading%20and%20Liquidity.md) refers to the ability to buy or sell securities within a short period without causing a significant impact on the security's price.
  - Traditionally,  brokers and dealers have been the primary providers of [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) in the [fixed income](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) market.
  - Regulatory changes following the [Global Financial Crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md),  such as the [Dodd-Frank Act](Note%20on%20The%20[[Credit%20Derivative%20Indexes) and Its Impact|[Dodd-Frank](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/Note%20on%20The%20Dodd-Frank%20Act%20and%20Its%20Impact.md)]] Act and the Volcker Rule,  have reduced the capacity of dealers to provide [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md).
	- Elevated bank capital requirements and prohibitions on proprietary trading have led to shrinking dealer inventories.
	- This reduction in dealer inventories has resulted in decreased bond [market liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Trading%20and%20Liquidity.md) and a decline in repo [market liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Trading%20and%20Liquidity.md).
	- Investors have faced challenging [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) conditions,  especially during periods of market stress,  such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Exhibit 2-1 illustrates the primary dealer position in corporate and securitized credit,  highlighting the impact of regulatory changes on dealer inventories.
- The [introduction](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Introduction.md) of [fixed income](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has been a significant development in the market.
  - [Fixed income ETFs](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) allow investors to adjust their [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)'s [fixed income](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) exposure quickly through exchange-traded markets.
  - Under normal market conditions,  ETFs provide [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) by enabling investors to buy and sell shares easily.
  - However,  during periods of dried-up [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md),  ETF prices can deviate significantly from their net asset value (NAV),  indicating that investors cannot fully escape the adverse impact of illiquidity in the underlying market.

## 2. Exchange-Rate Risk (Currency Risk)

- [Exchange-rate risk](../../Clippings/Currency%20Swap%20Basics.md),  also known as [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) risk,  arises when a bond's payments are denominated in a foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).
  - The U.S. dollar cash flows from such bonds depend on the foreign exchange rate at the time of payment.
  - For example,  if an investor purchases a bond with payments in Japanese yen,  a depreciation of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar will result in fewer dollars received.
  - Conversely,  if the yen appreciates,  the investor will receive more dollars.
  - In addition to [exchange-rate risk](../../Clippings/Currency%20Swap%20Basics.md),  investors are exposed to interest-rate risk in the local market where the bond is issued.

## 3. Volatility Risk

- Volatility risk is the risk that changes in [interest rate volatility](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Fixed%20Income%20Versus%20Equity%20Derivatives.md) will adversely affect the price of a bond with an embedded option.
  - The value of an option increases with expected interest-rate volatility.
  - For callable bonds or [mortgage-backed securities](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Fremont%20Financial%20Corp.%20(b).md),  increased volatility makes the embedded option more valuable to the borrower,  reducing the security's price.
  - Multifactor [risk models](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%204.md) refer to volatility risk as "vega,  " which measures the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in volatility.

## 4. Political or Legal Risk

- Political or legal risk arises from government actions that can affect the value of a security.
  - Examples include the imposition of additional taxes or the declaration of a tax-exempt bond as taxable.
  - Regulatory authorities may also deem certain securities unsuitable for [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md),  impacting their value.
  - Investors in tax-exempt [municipal securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md) face tax risk,  which includes the risk of reduced federal income tax rates or the potential for a bond to be declared taxable by the IRS.

## 5. Event Risk

- Event risk refers to the risk that an issuer's ability to make [interest and principal](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) payments is significantly affected by unforeseen events.
  - These events can include natural disasters,  industrial accidents,  takeovers,  or [corporate restructuring](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Southland%20Corp.%20(c).md).
  - For example,  a [leveraged buyout](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2014%20-%20Private%20Equity,%20Pension,%20and%20Sovereign%20Funds/Private%20Equity.md) (LBO) can increase a company's debt burden,  leading to a downgrade in its credit rating and an increase in yield spreads.

## 6. Sector Risk

- Sector risk is the risk of adverse differential movement in specific [market sectors](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Market%20Participants.md) due to various factors.
  - Different sectors,  such as industrial versus utility bonds or corporate versus mortgage-backed bonds,  respond differently to environmental changes.
  - Sector risk arises from a combination of risks,  including interest-rate risk,  [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md),  and others.

## 7. Other Risks

- In addition to the risks discussed,  investors face other risks in the [fixed income](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) market.
  - [Basis risk](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md) is a term used to encompass almost all risks other than [market risk](../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%205%20-%20Index%20Futures.md) (interest-rate risk).

## 8. Statistical Measures of Portfolio Risk

- [Portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) risk is measured using statistical measures such as standard deviation,  skewness,  and kurtosis.
  - Standard deviation provides a range around the average return within which the actual return is likely to fall with a specific probability.
  - Value at Risk (VaR) quantifies the lowest return expected over a specified time horizon at a certain confidence level.
  - Drawdown at Risk (DaR) indicates the lowest cumulative return from a [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) peak to trough.
  - Skewness measures the symmetry of a return distribution,  while kurtosis measures whether a distribution is peaked or flat relative to a normal distribution.

## 9. Tracking Error Risk

- Tracking error risk is the standard deviation of the active return of a [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md),  which is the difference between the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)'s return and a benchmark's return.
  - Backward-looking tracking error assesses past performance relative to a benchmark.
  - Forward-looking tracking error predicts future performance relative to a benchmark using multifactor [risk models](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%204.md).

## 10. The Structure of Interest Rates

- [Interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) in an economy are interdependent and influenced by various factors.
  - The base interest rate is the yield on U.S. government securities,  which serves as a benchmark for other [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).
  - The risk premium for non-[Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md) is the spread over the base interest rate,  reflecting additional risks such as [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md),  maturity,  embedded options,  taxability,  and [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md).

## 11. Types of Issuers

- The bond market is classified by the type of issuer,  including the U.S. government,  agencies,  municipal governments,  corporations,  and foreign governments.
  - The spread between [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) in different [market sectors](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Market%20Participants.md) is called an intermarket-sector spread.
  - Within a market sector,  the spread between issues is called an intramarket-sector spread.

## 12. Perceived Creditworthiness of Issuer

- [Credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) refers to the risk that a bond issuer may default on its obligations.
  - Credit spreads or quality spreads measure the difference in yield between [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md) and non-[Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md) of similar quality.

## 13. Term-to-Maturity

- The term-to-maturity of a bond affects its [price volatility](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Black%20Models%20for%20Bond%20Price%20Options%20Capsfloors.md).
  - Longer maturity bonds have greater [price volatility](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Black%20Models%20for%20Bond%20Price%20Options%20Capsfloors.md) due to changes in market yields.
  - The yield curve represents the relationship between yields on comparable securities with different maturities.

## 14. Inclusion of Options

- Bonds may include embedded options,  such as call or put provisions,  which affect their yield spreads.
  - A call provision allows the issuer to retire the debt before maturity,  benefiting the issuer but disadvantaging the bondholder.
  - The presence of an embedded option affects the spread of an issue relative to a Treasury security.

## 15. Taxability of Interest

- Interest income from bonds is generally taxable unless exempted under the federal income tax code.
  - Municipal bonds are typically exempt from federal income taxes,  resulting in lower yields compared to taxable bonds.
  - The equivalent taxable yield is the yield required on a taxable bond to match the after-tax yield of a tax-exempt bond.

## 16. Expected Liquidity of an Issue

- Bonds trade with varying degrees of [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md),  affecting the yield required by investors.
  - [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md) are the most liquid,  with lower yields reflecting their [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) and perceived [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md).

## 17. The Term Structure of Interest Rates

- The [term structure of interest rates](../../Financial%20Engineering/6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md) plays a crucial role in bond valuation.
  - The yield curve graphically depicts the relationship between yields on bonds of the same [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) but different maturities.
  - The Treasury yield curve serves as a benchmark for [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) bonds in other sectors.

## 18. Using the Yield Curve to Price a Bond

- The price of a bond is the present value of its cash flows,  discounted at appropriate [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).
  - Each [cash flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) should be discounted at a unique interest rate corresponding to its time period.
  - The [spot rate](../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) curve represents the yields on zero-coupon bonds and is used to price bonds accurately.

## 19. Constructing the Theoretical Spot-Rate Curve

- The theoretical spot-rate curve is constructed from the yield curve using bootstrapping.
  - Bootstrapping involves deriving spot rates from the yields of Treasury bills and coupon securities.
  - The process ensures that the value of a Treasury coupon security equals the value of its component zero-coupon instruments.

## Summary

- Understanding the various risks associated with [fixed income securities](../../Clippings/Bond%20Equivalent%20Yield%20(BEY)%20-%20Definition,%20Formula,%20and%20Example.md) is crucial for investors to assess potential [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) and manage [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) risk.

- The [term structure of interest rates](../../Financial%20Engineering/6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md),  represented by the yield curve,  is a critical factor in bond valuation and [investment decision](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%201%20Introduction%20to%20Securities%20Trading%20and%20Markets.md)-making.

# Lecture Notes: Theoretical Spot Rates and the Term Structure of Interest Rates

## 1. Introduction to Theoretical Spot Rates

- Theoretical spot rates are crucial for understanding the [term structure of interest rates](../../Financial%20Engineering/6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md).
  - They represent the yield on zero-coupon [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md) for various maturities.
  - Spot rates are used to price [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md) by discounting each [cash flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) at the appropriate rate.
  - The [term structure of interest rates](../../Financial%20Engineering/6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md) is depicted by the [spot rate](../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) curve,  which shows the relationship between spot rates and maturities.
- Exhibit 3-3 provides a detailed list of theoretical spot rates for maturities up to 10 years.
  - These rates are derived from the yield-to-maturity of [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md).
  - The spot rates are used to calculate the present value of cash flows from [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md).

## 2. Importance of Pricing Treasuries Based on Spot Rates

- Financial theory posits that the theoretical price of a Treasury security should equal the present value of its cash flows,  discounted at the appropriate spot rates.
  - This ensures that the actual market price of a Treasury security does not deviate significantly from its theoretical price.
  - [Arbitrage opportunities](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md) arise when there is a discrepancy between the market price and the theoretical price.
- Exhibit 3-4 illustrates the concept of [arbitrage](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) profit from coupon stripping.
  - A government dealer can buy a Treasury bond,  strip it into zero-coupon securities,  and sell them at yields corresponding to the theoretical spot rates.
  - The total proceeds from selling the stripped securities should equal the theoretical price of the original bond.

::: {.callout-note}

#### Example: Arbitrage Profit from Coupon Stripping

Consider a 10-year,  12.5% coupon Treasury bond selling at par with a yield-to-maturity of 12.5%. A government dealer buys the bond and strips it,  expecting to sell the zero-coupon securities at the yields indicated in Exhibit 3-3.

1. Calculate the present value of each [cash flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) using the bond's yield-to-maturity.
   - For example,  the present value of a $6.25 coupon payment in four years is calculated using a 12.5% yield.

1. Calculate the present value of each [cash flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) using the corresponding [spot rate](../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md).
   - For the same $6.25 coupon payment,  use the 10.4% [spot rate](../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) for four years.

1. Determine the [arbitrage](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) profit by comparing the total proceeds from selling the stripped securities to the cost of the original bond.

The [arbitrage](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) profit is the difference between the total proceeds and the cost of the bond.

## 3. Forward Rates and Their Calculation

- Forward rates are [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) implied by current spot rates for future periods.
  - They are used to determine the [expected return](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) on investments over different time horizons.
  - Forward rates can be calculated using spot rates for different maturities.
- The relationship between [spot rates and forward rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Forward%20Rates.md) is crucial for [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) decisions.
  - Investors can use forward rates to compare different [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) strategies and determine the best option.

::: {.callout-note}

#### Example: Calculating Forward Rates

Consider an investor with a one-year [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) horizon. The investor can choose between buying a one-year Treasury bill or buying a six-month Treasury bill and reinvesting in another six-month bill.

1. Calculate the spot rates for the six-month and one-year Treasury bills.
   - Use the given spot rates from Exhibit 3-3.

1. Determine the [forward rate](../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) that makes the investor indifferent between the two alternatives.
   - Use the formula for forward rates: $$f = \frac{(1+z_2)^2}{(1+z_1)} - 1$$

1. Verify the calculation by comparing the [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) from both [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) strategies.

The [forward rate](../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) ensures that both strategies yield the same return over the [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) horizon.

## 4. Relationship Between Spot Rates and Short-Term Forward Rates

- The relationship between [spot rates and forward rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Forward%20Rates.md) is essential for understanding the [term structure of interest rates](../../Financial%20Engineering/6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md).
  - Spot rates reflect the current market's [expectations](../Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) of future [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).
  - Forward rates provide insights into expected changes in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) over time.
- Investors use forward rates to make informed decisions about bond investments and to manage [interest rate risk](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md).

## 5. Determinants of the Shape of the Term Structure

- The [term structure of interest rates](../../Financial%20Engineering/6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md) can take various shapes,  including upward-sloping,  downward-sloping,  and flat yield curves.
  - The shape of the yield curve is influenced by [market expectations](../../Clippings/Forward%20Rate.md) of future [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and other factors.

  - **Preferred-Habitat Theory**: Investors have preferred maturity [ranges](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Exotic%20Interest%20Rate%20Options.md) and require a risk premium to shift from their preferred habitat.
  - **Market-Segmentation Theory**: The yield curve is determined by supply and demand within each maturity sector.

## Summary

- Theoretical spot rates are essential for [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md) and understanding the [term structure of interest rates](../../Financial%20Engineering/6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md).

# Lecture Notes: Bond Pricing,  Yield Measures,  and Total Return

## 1. Introduction to Bond Pricing and Yield Measures

- Bonds are [fixed income securities](../../Clippings/Bond%20Equivalent%20Yield%20(BEY)%20-%20Definition,%20Formula,%20and%20Example.md) that provide periodic interest payments and return the principal at maturity.
  - The price of a bond is determined by the present value of its [expected cash flows](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%206/Week%206%20Assignment%20Review.md).
  - The interest rate or [discount rate](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/PSET%207-%20Kohler.md) used to compute the present value depends on the yield offered on comparable securities in the market.
  - This chapter explains how to compute the price of an option-free bond and introduces various yield measures to assess the potential return from holding a bond.

## 2. Bond Pricing

- The price of any financial instrument is equal to the present value of the expected [cash flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md).
  - The [cash flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) of an option-free bond consists of periodic coupon interest payments and the par value at maturity.
  - Most bonds issued in the United States pay coupon interest semiannually.
  - The [cash flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) for an option-free bond consists of an annuity (fixed coupon interest) and the par or maturity value.
- Determining the [Cash Flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md):
  - The first step in determining the price of a bond is to determine its [cash flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md).
  - For example,  a 20-year bond with a 9% coupon rate and a par value of $1,    000 has semiannual coupon payments of $45 and a maturity value of $1,  000.
- Determining the Required Yield:
  - The required yield is the interest rate that an investor wants from investing in a bond.
  - It is determined by investigating the yields offered on comparable bonds in the market.
  - The required yield is typically specified as an [annual interest rate](../../Financial%20Instruments/Review%20Session%20Notes/Continuously%20Compounding%20Interest.md),  and for semiannual cash flows,  one-half the [annual interest rate](../../Financial%20Instruments/Review%20Session%20Notes/Continuously%20Compounding%20Interest.md) is used as the periodic interest rate.
- Determining the Price:
  - Given the cash flows of a bond and the required yield,  the price of the bond is equal to the present value of the cash flows.
  - The present value of the [coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) and maturity value can be calculated using the formula for an ordinary annuity.

::: {.callout-note}

#### Example: Bond Price Calculation

Compute the price of a 9% coupon bond with 20 years to maturity and a par value of $1,  000 if the required yield is 12%.

1. Calculate the present value of the 40 semiannual [coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) of $45 discounted at 6%.
   - The present value is $677.08.

1. Calculate the present value of the par value of $1,  000 discounted at 6%.
   - The present value is $97.22.

1. Sum the present values to find the bond price.
   - The bond price is $774.30.
:::

## 3. Yield Measures

- Yield measures are used to assess the potential return from investing in a bond.
  - Three common yield measures are current yield,  yield-to-maturity,  and yield-to-call.
- Current Yield:
  - The current yield relates the annual coupon interest to the market price.
  - It considers only the coupon interest and no other source of return.

::: {.callout-note}

#### Example: Current Yield Calculation

Calculate the current yield for an 18-year,  6% coupon bond selling for $700.89 per $1,  000 par value.

1. Calculate the annual dollar coupon interest.
   - The annual coupon interest is $60.

1. Calculate the current yield.
   - The current yield is $60 / $700.89 = 8.56%.
:::

- Yield-to-Maturity:
  - The yield-to-maturity is the interest rate that makes the present value of the cash flows equal to the price.
  - It considers the [coupon income](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Pl%20Attribution.md),  any capital gain or loss,  and the timing of the cash flows.

::: {.callout-note}

#### Example: Yield-to-Maturity Calculation

Calculate the yield-to-maturity for an 18-year,  6% coupon bond selling for $700.89.

1. Identify the cash flows: 36 [coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) of $30 every six months and $1,  000 at maturity.
2. Use trial and error to find the interest rate that makes the present value of the cash flows equal to $700.89.
3. The yield-to-maturity is 9.50%.
:::

## 4. Relationship Between Required Yield and Price

- The price of an option-free bond changes in the direction opposite to the change in the required yield.
  - As the required yield increases,  the present value of the cash flows decreases,  and hence the price decreases.
  - Conversely,  as the required yield decreases,  the present value of the cash flows increases,  and the price of the bond increases.
- The Relationship Among Coupon Rate,  Required Yield,  and Price:
  - When the coupon rate equals the required yield,  the price equals the par value.
  - When the coupon rate is less than the required yield,  the price is less than the par value.
  - When the coupon rate is greater than the required yield,  the price is greater than the par value.

## 5. Pricing a Zero-Coupon Bond

- Zero-coupon bonds do not make periodic [coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md).
  - The price of a zero-coupon bond is the present value of the maturity value.
  - The number of periods used to discount the maturity value is double the number of years to maturity.

::: {.callout-note}

#### Example: Zero-Coupon Bond Price Calculation

Calculate the price of a zero-coupon bond that matures in 10 years with a maturity value of $1,  000 if the required yield is 8.6%.

1. Calculate the present value of $1,  000 discounted at 4.3% for 20 periods.
   - The price is $430.83.
:::

## 6. Determining the Price When the Settlement Date Falls Between Coupon Periods

- When a bond is purchased between coupon dates,  the next coupon payment is less than six months away.
  - The price calculation must account for the number of days until the next coupon payment,  the present value of cash flows over fractional periods,  and [accrued interest](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md).
- Day Count:
  - Market conventions dictate the number of days until the next coupon payment.
  - [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md) use an "actual/actual" day count,  while corporate and municipal bonds use a "30/360" day count.
- Compounding:
  - The present value formula is modified to account for fractional periods.
  - The price is calculated using the formula for the present value of cash flows with fractional periods.
- [Accrued Interest](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md) and the Clean Price:
  - The buyer compensates the seller for the portion of the next coupon interest payment earned by the seller.
  - The [accrued interest](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md) is calculated based on the number of days from the last coupon payment to the settlement date.
  - The clean price is the [full price](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%201/Accrued%20Interest.md) minus the [accrued interest](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md).

## Summary

- Bond [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) involves determining the present value of [expected cash flows](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%206/Week%206%20Assignment%20Review.md) using the required yield.
- Yield measures,  such as current yield and yield-to-maturity,  assess the potential return from investing in a bond.
- The relationship between required yield and price is inverse,  with price decreasing as yield increases and vice versa.
- Zero-coupon bonds are priced based on the present value of the maturity value.
- When purchasing a bond between coupon dates,  the price calculation must account for fractional periods and [accrued interest](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md).

# Lecture Notes: Bond Investment Risks and Yield Measures

## 1. Introduction to Bond Investment Risks

- Investing in bonds involves understanding various risks that can affect the potential return.
  - Two primary risks are reinvestment risk and interest-rate risk.
  - Reinvestment risk arises when future reinvestment rates are lower than the yield-to-maturity at the time of purchase.
  - Interest-rate risk occurs when a bond must be sold at a loss due to rising [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).

## 2. Reinvestment Risk

- Reinvestment risk is the risk that future reinvestment rates will be less than the yield-to-maturity at the time the bond is purchased.
  - This risk is significant for long-term bonds and bonds with high coupon rates.
  - The longer the maturity,  the more the bond's total dollar return depends on reinvestment of [coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md).
  - High coupon rates increase dependency on reinvestment for achieving the yield-to-maturity.
- Zero-coupon bonds carry no reinvestment risk if held to maturity,  as they do not have periodic [coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md).

## 3. Interest-Rate Risk

- Interest-rate risk is the risk that a bond's price will fall due to rising [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).
  - This risk is a concern for investors who may need to sell the bond before maturity.
  - The degree of interest-rate risk varies among bonds and is influenced by factors such as maturity and coupon rate.

## 4. Yield-to-Maturity and Its Limitations

- Yield-to-maturity (YTM) is a measure of the potential return from holding a bond to maturity.
  - YTM assumes that all [coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) are reinvested at the YTM rate and that the bond is held to maturity.
  - This measure has limitations,  as it does not account for changes in reinvestment rates or the need to sell the bond before maturity.
- An investor's decision should consider [expectations](../Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) about future [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and reinvestment rates.

## 5. Yield-to-Maturity for a Zero-Coupon Bond

- Zero-coupon bonds have a single [cash flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) at maturity,  making YTM calculation straightforward.
  - The formula for YTM is: $$y = (\text{future value per dollar invested})^{1/n} - 1$$
  - Doubling the semiannual yield gives the annual YTM.

::: {.callout-note}

#### Example: Yield-to-Maturity for a Zero-Coupon Bond

Calculate the YTM for a zero-coupon bond selling for $274.78 with a maturity value of $1,  000 maturing in 15 years.

1. Calculate the future value per dollar invested: $$\frac{1,    000}{274.78} = 3.639275$$
2. Calculate the semiannual yield: $$(3.639275)^{1/30} - 1 = 0.044$$
3. Double the semiannual yield for the annual YTM: $$8.8\%$$
:::

## 6. Relationship Among Coupon Rate,  Current Yield,  and Yield-to-Maturity

- The relationship between coupon rate,  current yield,  and YTM depends on whether the bond is selling at par,  a discount,  or a premium.
  - At par: Coupon rate = Current yield = YTM
  - At a discount: Coupon rate < Current yield < YTM
  - At a premium: Coupon rate > Current yield > YTM

## 7. Effective Annual Yield

- The effective annual yield accounts for compounding and provides a more accurate measure of return than simply doubling the semiannual yield.
  - The formula is: $$(1 + \text{semiannual interest rate})^2 - 1$$

::: {.callout-note}

#### Example: Effective Annual Yield Calculation

Calculate the effective annual yield for a bond with a semiannual interest rate of 4.75%.

1. Calculate the effective annual yield: $$(1.0475)^2 - 1 = 0.0973$$
2. The effective annual yield is 9.73%.
:::

## 8. Yield-to-Call

- Yield-to-call (YTC) is a measure of return for callable bonds,  assuming the bond is called on a specific date.
  - YTC considers the cash flows up to the call date and assumes reinvestment at the YTC rate.
  - Conservative investors compare YTC and YTM,  selecting the lower as a measure of potential return.

::: {.callout-note}

#### Example: Yield-to-Call Calculation

Calculate the YTC for an 18-year,  6% coupon bond selling for $700.89,     callable in 5 years at $1,  030.

1. Identify the cash flows: 10 [coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) of $30 and $1,  030 at the call date.
2. Use trial and error to find the interest rate that makes the present value of cash flows equal to $700.89.
3. The YTC is 15.2% (double the periodic interest rate of 7.6%).
:::

## 9. Yield for a Portfolio

- The yield for a bond [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is not simply the average of individual bond yields.
  - It is computed by determining the cash flows for the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and finding the interest rate that equates the present value of cash flows to the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)'s market value.

::: {.callout-note}

#### Example: Portfolio Yield Calculation

Calculate the yield for a [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) with bonds A,  B,  and C,  with a total market value of $57,  259,  000.

1. Determine the cash flows for each bond and the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).
2. Find the interest rate that makes the present value of cash flows equal to $57,  259,  000.
3. The [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) yield is 9.54% on a bond-equivalent basis.
:::

## 10. Total Return Analysis

- Total return considers all sources of potential dollar return over an [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) horizon.
  - It requires projecting total future dollars and calculating the interest rate that makes the bond's price grow to the projected total future dollars.
- Steps for calculating total return:
  1. Compute total [coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) plus interest-on-interest based on an assumed reinvestment rate.
  2. Determine the projected sale price at the end of the [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) horizon.
  3. Add the values from steps 1 and 2 for total future dollars.
  4. Calculate the semiannual total return: $$\left(\frac{\text{total future dollars}}{\text{purchase price of bond}}\right)^{1/h} - 1$$
  5. Double the semiannual total return for the annual total return.

## Summary

- Understanding bond [investment risks](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md),  such as reinvestment risk and interest-rate risk,  is crucial for assessing potential [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md).
- Yield measures,  including YTM,  YTC,  and [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) yield,  provide insights into potential [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) but have limitations.
- Total return analysis offers a comprehensive measure of potential return by considering all sources of dollar return over an [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) horizon.
- Investors should consider [expectations](../Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) about future [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and reinvestment rates when evaluating bond investments.

# Lecture Notes: Total Return Analysis and Interest Rate Risk

## 1. Introduction to Total Return Analysis

- Total return analysis is a comprehensive framework for evaluating the potential return from holding a bond over a specified [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) horizon.
  - It considers all sources of potential dollar return,  including [coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md),  reinvestment of those payments,  and the sale price of the bond at the end of the [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) horizon.
  - This approach allows [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) managers to assess bond performance under various interest-rate scenarios,  providing a more realistic measure of potential return than traditional yield measures like yield-to-maturity (YTM).

## 2. Total Return Calculation

- The total return calculation involves several steps:
  1. **Compute Total [Coupon Payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) Plus Interest-on-Interest**: Calculate the total [coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) received over the [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) horizon and the interest earned on [reinvested coupons](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Yield%20and%20Return.md).
  2. **Determine Projected Sale Price**: Estimate the bond's sale price at the end of the [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) horizon based on expected market yields.
  3. **Calculate Total Future Dollars**: Add the total [coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) plus interest-on-interest to the projected sale price.
  4. **Compute Semiannual Total Return**: Determine the semiannual total return by comparing total future dollars to the bond's purchase price.
  5. **Convert to Bond-Equivalent and Effective Annual Yield**: Double the semiannual total return for the bond-equivalent yield and use the formula $$(1 + \text{semiannual total return})^2 - 1$$ for the effective annual yield.

#### Example: Total Return Calculation

Suppose an investor with a three-year [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) horizon is considering purchasing a 20-year,  8% coupon bond for \$828.40. The YTM is 10%,  and the investor expects to reinvest [coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) at 6% annually. At the end of the horizon,  the bond is expected to yield 7%.

1. **Total [Coupon Payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) Plus Interest-on-Interest**:
   - [Coupon payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) are \$40 every six months for three years (six periods).
   - Total coupon interest plus interest-on-interest is calculated as:
   $$\text{Coupon plus interest-on-interest} = 40 \left(\frac{(1.03)^6 - 1}{0.03}\right) = 258.74$$

1. **Projected Sale Price**:
   - The projected sale price at the end of three years,  assuming a 7% YTM for 17-year bonds,  is \$1,  098.51.

1. **Total Future Dollars**:
   - Total future dollars = \$258.74 + \$1,  098.51 = \$1,  357.25.

1. **Semiannual Total Return**:
   - $$\left(\frac{1,    357.25}{828.40}\right)^{1/6} - 1 = 0.0858 \text{ or } 8.58\%$$

1. **Bond-Equivalent and Effective Annual Yield**:
   - Bond-equivalent yield = 17.16%.
   - Effective annual yield = $$(1.0858)^2 - 1 = 0.1790 \text{ or } 17.90\%$$

## 3. Scenario Analysis

- [Scenario analysis](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%204%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%204%20Valuing%20Young%20and%20High‐Growth%20Companies.md) involves evaluating bond performance under various assumptions about reinvestment rates and future yields.
  - This approach helps [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) managers understand how sensitive a bond's performance is to changes in these variables.
  - By analyzing multiple scenarios,  managers can identify conditions under which the bond may underperform or outperform [expectations](../Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md).

## 4. Evaluating Bond Swaps

- Bond swaps involve exchanging one bond for another to achieve specific [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) objectives.
  - **Pure Yield Pickup Swap**: Switching to a bond with a higher yield to increase current income or YTM.
  - **Rate-Anticipation Swap**: Positioning the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) to benefit from expected changes in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).
  - **Intermarket-Spread Swap**: Exploiting perceived misalignments in yield spreads between bonds.
  - **Substitution Swap**: Exchanging similar bonds to capitalize on market inefficiencies.

## 5. Comparing Municipal and [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md)

- The taxable equivalent yield is used to compare tax-exempt municipal bonds with taxable [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md).
  - It calculates the yield a taxable bond must offer to match the after-tax yield of a municipal bond.
  - The formula is: $$\text{Taxable equivalent yield} = \frac{\text{Tax-exempt yield}}{1 - \text{tax rate}}$$
  - This approach has limitations,  as it does not account for differences in reinvestment opportunities and tax implications.

## 6. Key Points

- Total return analysis provides a comprehensive measure of potential return by considering all sources of dollar return.
- Yield measures like YTM and yield-to-call have limitations,  as they assume constant reinvestment rates and do not account for changes in market conditions.
- [Scenario analysis](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%204%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%204%20Valuing%20Young%20and%20High‐Growth%20Companies.md) and total return frameworks allow [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) managers to evaluate bond performance under various conditions,  aiding in decision-making for bond swaps and [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) strategies.

## 7. Measuring Interest-Rate Risk

- Interest-rate risk is the risk that changes in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) will affect the value of a bond or bond [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).
  - The full-valuation approach involves revaluing a bond or [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) under different interest-rate scenarios to assess exposure.
  - This approach is also known as [scenario analysis](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%204%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%204%20Valuing%20Young%20and%20High‐Growth%20Companies.md) and can handle both parallel and non-parallel yield-curve shifts.
- **Full-Valuation Approach**:
  - Revalue the bond or [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) for different interest-rate change scenarios.
  - Assess the impact of interest-[rate changes](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md) on market value and percentage change in value.
- **Example**:
  - Consider a \$10 million position in a 5% coupon 20-year bond with a current price of 106.5484 and a YTM of 4.5%.
  - Evaluate exposure to 50,  100,  and 200 basis point increases in yield.

# Lecture Notes: Interest-Rate Risk and Bond Pricing

## 1. Introduction to Interest-Rate Risk

- Interest-rate risk is a critical consideration for bond investors,  as changes in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) can significantly impact the value of a bond or bond [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).
  - Regulators often require depository institutions to simulate interest-rate scenarios to assess the impact on bond portfolios.
  - This practice,  known as stress testing,  involves evaluating the exposure of a [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) to extreme interest-[rate changes](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md).
  - The full-valuation approach is a recommended method for assessing interest-rate risk,  especially for portfolios with a few bonds.

## 2. Full-Valuation Approach

- The full-valuation approach involves revaluing a bond or [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) under different interest-rate scenarios to assess exposure.
  - This approach is time-consuming for large portfolios,  especially those with complex bonds (e.g.,  bonds with embedded options).
  - [Duration and convexity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%208/An%20Analytical%20Decomposition%20of%20Forward%20Rates.md) are alternative measures that provide a starting point for assessing interest-rate risk.

### Example: Full-Valuation Approach

::: {.callout-note}

#### Example: Interest-Rate Risk Assessment

Consider a bond [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) with two bonds,  each evaluated under three scenarios of yield changes.

1. **Bond 1**: 4% coupon,  10-year bond,  initial price $109.4713$,  yield 2%.
   - Scenario 1: Yield change 50 bp,  new yield 2.5%,  new price $107.0091$,  new market value $5,    350,    455$.
   - Scenario 2: Yield change 100 bp,  new yield 3.0%,  new price $104.6111$,  new market value $5,    230,    555$.
   - Scenario 3: Yield change 200 bp,  new yield 4.0%,  new price $100.0000$,  new market value $5,    000,    000$.

1. **Bond 2**: 5% coupon,  12-year bond,  initial price $106.5484$,  yield 4.5%.
   - Scenario 1: Yield change 10 bp,  new yield 4.6%,  new price $105.1940$,  new market value $10,    519,    400$.
   - Scenario 2: Yield change 50 bp,  new yield 5.0%,  new price $100.0000$,  new market value $10,    000,    000$.
   - Scenario 3: Yield change 100 bp,  new yield 5.5%,  new price $93.9805$,  new market value $9,    398,    050$.

1. **[Portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) Market Value**:
   - Initial market value: $16,    128,    403$.
   - Scenario 1: $15,    869,    855$,  percentage change $-1.60\%$.
   - Scenario 2: $15,    230,    555$,  percentage change $-5.57\%$.
   - Scenario 3: $14,    398,    050$,  percentage change $-10.73\%$.

## 3. Price Volatility Characteristics of Bonds

- The [price volatility](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Black%20Models%20for%20Bond%20Price%20Options%20Capsfloors.md) of a bond is influenced by its maturity,  coupon rate,  and the presence of embedded options.
  - Option-free bonds exhibit a price/yield relationship where the price changes inversely with yield changes.
  - The relationship is not linear,  and the percentage price change varies with the magnitude of yield changes.

### Properties of Option-Free Bonds

- **Property 1**: The percentage price change is not the same for all bonds.
- **Property 2**: For small yield changes,  the percentage price change is roughly the same for increases or decreases in yield.
- **Property 3**: For large yield changes,  the percentage price change differs for increases versus decreases in yield.
- **Property 4**: For large yield changes,  the percentage price increase is greater than the percentage price decrease.

## 4. Bond Features Affecting Interest-Rate Risk

### Impact of Maturity

- Longer maturity bonds have greater [price sensitivity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Duration.md) to interest-[rate changes](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md).
  - Example: A 20-year bond with a 4% coupon experiences a 6.55% price decline with a 50 bp yield increase,  while a 5-year bond experiences only a 2.22% decline.

### Impact of Coupon Rate

- Lower coupon rate bonds have greater [price sensitivity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Duration.md) to interest-[rate changes](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md).
  - Example: A 5% 20-year bond experiences a 6.27% price decline with a 50 bp yield increase,  less than a 4% bond's 6.55% decline.

### Impact of Embedded Options

- Bonds with embedded options,  such as callable bonds,  exhibit different price/yield relationships.
  - Callable bonds have [negative convexity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Mortgage%20Pricing%20Spreads%20and%20Duration.md),  meaning price appreciation is less than price decline for large yield changes.
  - Putable bonds offer protection against rising yields,  as the bondholder can redeem the bond at the put price.

## 5. Duration and Convexity

- [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) measures the approximate percentage change in a bond's value for a 100 basis point change in rates.
  - It provides a first approximation of [price sensitivity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Duration.md).
  - [Convexity](../Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) improves the estimate by accounting for the curvature of the price/yield relationship.

### Calculating Duration

- [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) is calculated using the formula:
  $$\text{Duration} = \frac{V_- - V_+}{2(V_0)(\Delta y)}$$
  - Example: A 5% 20-year bond with a [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of 13.09 indicates a 13.09% price change for a 100 bp yield change.

### Approximating Percentage Price Change

- The approximate percentage price change is calculated as:
  $$\text{Approximate percentage price change} = -\text{duration} \times \Delta y \times 100$$
  - Example: For a 10 bp yield increase,  the approximate percentage price change is $-1.309\%$.

## Summary

- Interest-rate risk is a key consideration for bond investors,  and the full-valuation approach provides a comprehensive assessment of exposure.
- [Duration and convexity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%208/An%20Analytical%20Decomposition%20of%20Forward%20Rates.md) offer alternative measures for estimating [price sensitivity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Duration.md) to interest-[rate changes](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md).
- The [price volatility](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Black%20Models%20for%20Bond%20Price%20Options%20Capsfloors.md) of bonds is influenced by maturity,  coupon rate,  and embedded options,  with longer maturity and lower coupon rate bonds exhibiting greater sensitivity.
- Understanding these concepts is crucial for managing bond portfolios and assessing potential risks and [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md).

## 2. Duration as a Measure of Interest Rate Risk

- [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) is the approximate percentage change in a bond's price for a 100 basis point change in yield.
  - It is calculated using the formula:
	$$\text{Duration} = \frac{V_- - V_+}{2(V_0)(\Delta y)}$$
  - Where \(V_-\) and \(V_+\) are the bond prices for a small decrease and increase in yield,  respectively,  \(V_0\) is the initial bond price,  and \(\Delta y\) is the change in yield.
- [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) provides a linear approximation of price changes,  which is accurate for small yield changes but less so for larger changes.

### Example: Duration Estimation

For a 10 basis point increase in yield:

- Estimated percentage price change: \(-1.309\%\)
- Estimated new price: \(113.6777 \times (1 - 0.01309) = 112.1897\)

Actual new price: 112.2027

For a 10 basis point decrease in yield:

- Estimated percentage price change: \(+1.309\%\)
- Estimated new price: \(113.6777 \times (1 + 0.01309) = 115.1658\)

Actual new price: 115.1783

#### Example: Convexity Adjustment for a 200 Basis Point Change
- [Convexity measure](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Convexity.md): 112.38

For a 200 basis point increase in yield:

- [Convexity adjustment](../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20II%20-%20Fixed%20Income%20Cash%20Markets/Chapter%2010%20-%20Bonds:%20Duration%20and%20Convexity.md): \(112.38 \times (0.02)^2 \times 100 = 4.50\%\)
- Total estimated percentage price change: \(-26.18\% + 4.50\% = -21.68\%\)

Actual percentage price change: \(-22.20\%\)

For a 200 basis point decrease in yield:

- [Convexity adjustment](../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20II%20-%20Fixed%20Income%20Cash%20Markets/Chapter%2010%20-%20Bonds:%20Duration%20and%20Convexity.md): \(112.38 \times (0.02)^2 \times 100 = 4.50\%\)
- Total estimated percentage price change: \(+26.18\% + 4.50\% = +30.68\%\)

Actual percentage price change: \(+31.29\%\)

## 5. Modified Duration vs. Effective Duration

- [Modified duration](../../Financial%20Engineering/A%20Guide%20to%20Duration%20DV01%20and%20Yield%20Curve.md) assumes that cash flows do not change with yield changes,  suitable for option-free bonds.
- Effective [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) accounts for changes in [expected cash flows](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%206/Week%206%20Assignment%20Review.md) due to yield changes,  suitable for bonds with embedded options.

### Example: Modified vs. Effective Duration

- A callable bond may have a [modified duration](../../Financial%20Engineering/A%20Guide%20to%20Duration%20DV01%20and%20Yield%20Curve.md) of 5 but an effective [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of 3.
- Effective [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) provides a more accurate measure of [price sensitivity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Duration.md) for bonds with embedded options.

## 6. Portfolio Duration and Spread Duration

- [Portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) is the weighted average of the durations of individual bonds in the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).
  - It provides an estimate of the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)'s sensitivity to [interest rate changes](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke-Chapter%2012%20to%20Chapter%2014.md).

# Lecture Notes: Convexity,  Duration,  and Interest Rate Risk

## 1. Introduction to Convexity and Duration

- [Convexity and duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Hedging%20a%20Century%20Bond%20Part%20Ii.md) are essential tools in bond [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) and [interest rate risk](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) management.
  - [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) measures the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md),  providing an estimate of the percentage price change for a 100 basis point change in yield.
  - [Convexity](../Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) accounts for the curvature in the price/yield relationship,  improving the accuracy of [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) estimates for large yield changes.

## 2. Scaling the Convexity Measure

- The [convexity measure](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Convexity.md),  as given by Eq (5-4),  is not meaningful in isolation.
  - It is the substitution of the computed [convexity measure](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Convexity.md) into Eq (5-5) that provides the estimated adjustment for [convexity](../Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md).
  - The [convexity measure](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Convexity.md) can be scaled in various ways,  and the same [convexity adjustment](../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20II%20-%20Fixed%20Income%20Cash%20Markets/Chapter%2010%20-%20Bonds:%20Duration%20and%20Convexity.md) can be obtained.

### Different Definitions of Convexity Measure

- **Equation (5-4)**:
  $$\text{Convexity measure} = \frac{V_{+} + V_{-} - 2V_{0}}{2V_{0}(\Delta y)^{2}}$$

- **Equation (5-6)**:
  $$\text{Convexity measure} = \frac{V_{+} + V_{-} - 2V_{0}}{V_{0}(\Delta y)^{2}}$$
  - This measure is double that of Eq (5-4).
- **Equation (5-8)**:
  $$\text{Convexity measure} = \frac{V_{+} + V_{-} - 2V_{0}}{2V_{0}(\Delta y)^{2}(100)}$$
  - This measure includes 100 in the denominator.
- **Equation (5-10)**:
  $$\text{Convexity measure} = \frac{V_{+} + V_{-} - 2V_{0}}{V_{0}(\Delta y)^{2}(100)}$$

### Convexity Adjustment Formulas

- **Using Eq (5-4)**:
  $$\text{Convexity adjustment} = \text{convexity measure} \times (\Delta y)^2 \times 100$$

- **Using Eq (5-6)**:
  $$\text{Convexity adjustment} = (\text{convexity measure}/2) \times (\Delta y)^2 \times 100$$

- **Using Eq (5-8)**:
  $$\text{Convexity adjustment} = \text{convexity measure} \times (\Delta y)^2 \times 10,    000$$

- **Using Eq (5-10)**:
  $$\text{Convexity adjustment} = (\text{convexity measure}/2) \times (\Delta y)^2 \times 10,    000$$

### Key Takeaway

- The [convexity measure](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Convexity.md) itself is not important; it is the [convexity adjustment](../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20II%20-%20Fixed%20Income%20Cash%20Markets/Chapter%2010%20-%20Bonds:%20Duration%20and%20Convexity.md) that matters.
- When comparing [convexity](../Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) measures from different sources,  it is crucial to understand how they are computed to use the correct adjustment formula.

## 3. Modified Convexity and Effective Convexity

- **Modified [Convexity](../Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md)**: Assumes cash flows do not change with yield changes,  suitable for option-free bonds.
- **Effective [Convexity](../Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md)**: Assumes cash flows change with yield changes,  suitable for bonds with embedded options.

### Example: Effective Duration and Convexity

- **Option-Free Bond**:
  - Effective [duration and convexity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%208/An%20Analytical%20Decomposition%20of%20Forward%20Rates.md) are almost identical to modified measures for small yield changes.
  - Example: Effective [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) = 4.67,  Effective [convexity](../Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) = 24.84.
- **Callable Bond**:
  - Effective [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) increases as rates rise,  reflecting decreased likelihood of being called.
  - Example: Effective [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) = 4.50,  Effective [convexity](../Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) = -47.46.
- **Putable Bond**:
  - Effective [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) decreases as rates rise,  reflecting increased likelihood of being put.
  - Example: Effective [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) = 3.17,  Effective [convexity](../Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) = 228.32.

## 4. Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP)

- PVBP measures the absolute change in bond price for a 1 basis point change in yield.
  - It is related to [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) and provides a measure of [price volatility](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Black%20Models%20for%20Bond%20Price%20Options%20Capsfloors.md).
  - Example: For a bond with a 4% coupon and 20-year maturity,  PVBP = $0.1369$.

## Summary

- [Convexity and duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Hedging%20a%20Century%20Bond%20Part%20Ii.md) are crucial for assessing [interest rate risk](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) and estimating bond price changes.
- The [convexity measure](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Convexity.md) can be scaled in various ways,  but the [convexity adjustment](../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20II%20-%20Fixed%20Income%20Cash%20Markets/Chapter%2010%20-%20Bonds:%20Duration%20and%20Convexity.md) is what matters.
- Modified and effective [convexity](../Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) provide insights into [price sensitivity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Duration.md) for option-free and option-embedded bonds,  respectively.
- PVBP offers an additional measure of [price volatility](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Black%20Models%20for%20Bond%20Price%20Options%20Capsfloors.md),  related to [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md).

# Lecture Notes: Interest Rate Risk,  Duration,  and U.S. Treasury Securities

## 1. Introduction to Interest Rate Risk and Duration

- [Interest rate risk](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) is a fundamental concern for bond investors,  as changes in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) can significantly impact the value of a bond or bond [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).
  - [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) is a key measure used to assess [interest rate risk](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md),  representing the approximate percentage change in a bond's price for a 100 basis point change in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).
  - [Convexity](../Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) further refines this measure by accounting for the curvature in the price/yield relationship,  improving the accuracy of [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) estimates for large yield changes.

## 2. Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP)

- PVBP is a specific application of [dollar duration](../../Financial%20Engineering/A%20Guide%20to%20Duration%20DV01%20and%20Yield%20Curve.md),  measuring the absolute change in a bond's price for a 1 basis point change in yield.
  - It is calculated using the bond's [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) and initial price.
  - For example,  consider a 5% 20-year bond with a [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of 13.09 and an initial price of 113.6777.
	- The approximate percentage price change for a 1 basis point increase in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) is calculated as:
	  $$13.09 \times 0.0001 \times 100 = 0.1309\%$$
	- The dollar price change is then:
	  $$0.1309\% \times 113.6777 = \$0.1488$$
	- This is the same price change as the PVBP for this bond.

## 3. Comparing Interest Rate Risk Across Bonds

- The [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of a bond is influenced by its coupon rate,  yield level,  and maturity.
  - A 10-year non-[investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade bond may have a lower [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) than a current coupon 10-year Treasury note due to its higher coupon rate and yield level.
  - However,  this does not necessarily mean it has less [interest rate risk](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md),  as yield volatility is also a critical factor.
  - Similarly,  a 10-year Swiss government bond may have a higher [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) than a current coupon 10-year U.S. Treasury note due to its lower coupon rate and yield level.
	- Despite the higher [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md),  the [interest rate risk](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) may be lower due to lower yield volatility.
- Yield volatility,  or [interest rate volatility](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Fixed%20Income%20Versus%20Equity%20Derivatives.md),  is a key determinant of [interest rate risk](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) for a given [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) and bond position.
  - Non-[investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade bonds typically exhibit greater yield volatility than current coupon Treasuries,  increasing their [interest rate risk](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md).
  - Conversely,  Swiss government bonds generally have lower yield volatility than U.S. Treasuries,  reducing their [interest rate risk](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) despite higher [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md).

## 4. Value-at-Risk (VaR) Framework

- The VaR framework ties together the [price sensitivity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Duration.md) of a bond position to [rate changes](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md) and yield volatility.
  - Risk is defined as the maximum estimated loss in market value of a given position expected to occur with a specified probability.

## 5. Key Points on Interest Rate Risk Management

- The full-valuation approach involves repricing bonds under different interest rate scenarios to quantify [price sensitivity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Duration.md).
  - Important properties of bond [price volatility](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Black%20Models%20for%20Bond%20Price%20Options%20Capsfloors.md) for option-free bonds include:
	- Prices move inversely to yields,  but percentage price changes are not uniform across bonds.
	- For small yield changes,  the percentage price change is roughly the same for yield increases or decreases.
	- For large yield changes,  the percentage price change differs for yield increases versus decreases.
	- For a given large yield change,  the percentage price increase is greater than the percentage price decrease.
- Bond features affect [interest rate risk](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md):
  - Longer maturity leads to more [interest rate risk](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md).
  - Higher coupon rate leads to less [interest rate risk](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md).
  - [Interest rate risk](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) is greater at lower yields.
  - Embedded options,  such as call or put provisions,  also affect [interest rate risk](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md).
- The [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)/[convexity](../Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) approach is an alternative to the full-valuation approach.
  - [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) assumes a flat [term structure](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) and parallel shifts in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).
  - [Convexity](../Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) adjustments improve [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) estimates,  particularly for large [interest rate changes](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke-Chapter%2012%20to%20Chapter%2014.md).
  - Effective [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) accounts for changes in cash flows due to [interest rate changes](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke-Chapter%2012%20to%20Chapter%2014.md),  requiring a [term structure](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) model.

# Lecture Notes: U.S. Treasury Securities and Agency Debt Securities

## 1. Introduction to U.S. Treasury Securities

- U.S. [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md) are debt obligations issued by the Department of the Treasury,  representing the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.
  - They are considered risk-free instruments and serve as benchmarks for [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) other securities.
  - [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md) are issued as either discount securities (bills) or coupon securities (notes,  bonds,  TIPS,  and FRNs).
  - They are traded in a highly liquid [secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md),  used for [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md),  [hedging](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md),  and as reserve assets.

### 1.1. STRIPS Program

- The Separate Trading of Registered [Interest and Principal](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) Securities (STRIPS) program was introduced in February 1985 to enhance the [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) of the zero-coupon market.
  - It allows the individual components of eligible [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md) to be held separately in the Federal Reserve’s book-entry system.
  - Institutions can request that a security be stripped into its separate components,  each receiving its own CUSIP number.
  - The components remain direct obligations of the U.S. government.
  - The program was expanded in September 1997 to include all new coupon issues.
- As of December 31,  2019,  $331 billion of Treasury notes and bonds were held in stripped form,     representing about 3% of the $12.3 trillion in notes and bonds outstanding.
  - The rate of stripping varies across issue types,  with roughly 14% of bonds stripped but only 0.1% of notes stripped.

### 1.2. Key Points

- Marketable [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md) are sold in the [primary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) through sealed-bid,  single-price auctions.
- Secondary trading occurs in a multiple-dealer [over-the-counter market](../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20%20Pricing%20of%20Caps%20and%20Floors.md).
- Zero-coupon [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md) are created through the STRIPS program,  appealing to both pension funds and speculators due to their sensitivity to [interest rate changes](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke-Chapter%2012%20to%20Chapter%2014.md).

## 2. Agency Debt Securities

- Agency [debt securities](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) are obligations of federal government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs).
  - Federal agencies are entities of the U.S. government,  such as the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).
  - GSEs are publicly chartered but privately owned entities,  such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
  - Agency [debt securities](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and trade with some [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md).

### 2.1. Agency Debt Market Overview

- The market for agency [debt securities](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) expanded rapidly during the 1990s,  primarily due to increased issuance from housing-related agencies.
  - The agency debt market has declined since its peak,  reaching nearly $2 trillion by the second quarter of 2020.
  - The decline is largely due to limitations imposed on some housing-related GSEs following the 2008 [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md).
- Exhibit 8-1 and Exhibit 8-2 provide data on agency debt outstanding and by issuer,  respectively.

### 2.2. Credit Quality of Agency Securities

- Agency securities are perceived to have government backing due to their legal characteristics and affiliation with the U.S. government.
  - However,  there is no explicit government guarantee for most agency securities.
  - The [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) difference between agency and [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md) depends on the strength of each agency’s underlying business and perceived government backing.

### 2.3. Conservatorship and Credit Quality

- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed in conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) in September 2008.
  - The U.S. Treasury Department and FHFA established Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements (PSPA) to ensure stability and protect taxpayers.
  - Despite conservatorship,  the government did not provide an explicit guarantee for their outstanding debentures.

### 2.4. Agency Debt Investors

- Agency debt attracts a variety of investors due to its relatively high [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) and tax-exempt interest income for some issuers.
  - The composition of agency debt investors depends on the tenor of the debt maturity,  with asset managers being the largest ownership segment.

### 2.5. Types of Agency Debt Securities

- Agencies issue a variety of securities to manage financing needs and interest-rate risk.
  - Short-dated securities,  known as discount notes,  have maturities of less than one year.
  - Longer-dated securities have maturities of between 1 and 30 years and include fixed-rate,  floating-rate,  and callable structures.
- Agencies also issue SOFR-related floating-rate notes,  with FHLB being the largest issuer.

### 2.6. Callable Securities and Interest-Rate Risk Management

- Agencies issue callable [debt securities](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) to manage interest-rate and cash-flow risk,  particularly related to mortgage prepayment speeds.
  - Callable securities have characteristics such as maturity date,  lockout period,  and call feature type (European,  Bermudan,  or American).
  - Agencies also use interest-rate [derivatives](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) like swaps and swaptions for [risk management](../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md).

## 3. Primary and Secondary Markets for Agency Debt

### 3.1. Primary Market

- Agencies use various methods to distribute securities,  including competitive dealer bidding,  issuance allocation,  and direct sales.
  - Short-dated securities are often issued through discount note auctions or reverse inquiry sales.
  - Longer-dated securities may be issued through syndicated offerings or reopening auctions.

### 3.2. Secondary Market

- Agency securities trade in a multiple-dealer over-the-counter [secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md),  similar to [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md).
  - Trading volume is lower than in the Treasury market but still significant relative to other [fixed income markets](../../Financial%20Engineering/A%20Practical%20Guide%20to%20Bonds%20and%20Swaps.md).

## 4. Agency Debt Issuance

- The quantity of agency [debt securities](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) sold in the [primary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) increased through the 1990s and 2000s but has declined since 2008.
  - Agency debt outstanding peaked in 2008 at $3.2 trillion and was $1.8 trillion at the end of 2019.
  - Housing-related agencies are the largest issuers,  with the FHLB having the largest share of agency debt outstanding.

# Lecture Notes: Municipal Bonds and Agency Debt Securities

## 1. Introduction to Agency Debt Securities

- Agency [debt securities](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) are obligations issued by federal government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs).
  - These securities are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government,  but they are perceived to have limited [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) due to their affiliation with the government.
  - Agency securities have historically traded at a discount to [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md),  reflecting their [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md).
  - The issuance and outstanding amounts of agency securities grew in the early 2000s but have declined due to restrictions from the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
- Agencies issue a variety of [debt securities](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md),  including discount notes with maturities of less than one year and medium-term notes with various structures for maturities greater than one year.
  - Agencies use different methods to distribute their securities,  such as competitive dealer bidding through auctions,  issuance allocation to dealers,  sales to investors through dealers,  and direct sales to investors.
- The majority of agency debt issued and traded is from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system,  Fannie Mae,  Freddie Mac,  and the Farm Credit System.

## 2. Municipal Bonds

- The U.S. bond market is divided into two major sectors: the taxable bond market and the tax-exempt bond market.
  - The taxable bond market includes bonds issued by the U.S. government,  U.S. government agencies,  and corporations.
  - The tax-exempt bond market consists of bonds whose interest is exempt from federal income taxation,  although it may be taxable at the state and local levels.
- The municipal bond market is a significant component of the domestic bond market,  with an estimated size of $3.8 trillion as of 2020.
  - The majority of tax-exempt securities are issued by state and local governments and their creations,  such as authorities and special districts.
  - The primary motivation for investing in tax-exempt municipal bonds is their tax advantage.
- The primary owners of municipal bonds are individual investors,  mutual funds,  commercial banks,  and property and casualty insurance companies.
  - [Institutional investors](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%204%20Institutional%20Trading.md),  such as pension funds,  may also invest in municipal bonds when they offer higher yields compared to taxable bonds.
- The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 reduced the corporate tax rate,  impacting the holdings of municipal bonds by commercial banks and other [institutional investors](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%204%20Institutional%20Trading.md).

## 3. Features of Municipal Securities

- [Municipal securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md) can include call and refunding provisions,  sinking-fund provisions,  and put provisions.
  - Coupon rates on municipal issues can be fixed or reset periodically,  with floating-rate or variable-rate issues linked to reference rates such as the Securities Industry and [Financial Markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) Association (SIFMA) index,  LIBOR,  or Treasury bills.
- Some municipal issues are original-issue discount bonds (OIDs),  issued at a discount from their maturity value,  with the difference representing tax-exempt interest.
- Zero-coupon bonds and bonds with [accrued interest](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md) paid at maturity are types of municipal issues that do not distribute periodic interest.

## 4. Types of Municipal Obligations

- Municipal bonds can be categorized into two broad security structures: general obligation bonds and revenue bonds.

### 4.1. General Obligation Bonds

- General obligation bonds are [debt instruments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) issued by states,  counties,  special districts,  cities,  towns,  and school districts.
  - They are secured by the issuer’s general taxing powers,  often referred to as full faith and credit obligations.
  - Some general obligation bonds are double-barreled,  secured by both general taxing powers and additional revenues from fees,  grants,  and special charges.

### 4.2. Revenue Bonds

- Revenue bonds are issued for project or enterprise financings,  with revenues generated by the operating projects pledged to bondholders.
  - Examples include airport revenue bonds,  charter school bonds,  college and university revenue bonds,  continuing care retirement community bonds,  higher education bonds,  hospital revenue bonds,  industrial development and pollution control revenue bonds,  land-secured "dirt" bonds,  multifamily revenue bonds,  public power revenue bonds,  public-private partnerships (PPPs),  resource recovery revenue bonds,  seaport revenue bonds,  sewer revenue bonds,  single-family mortgage revenue bonds,  sports complex and convention center revenue bonds,  student loan revenue bonds,  tax-allocation bonds,  tobacco revenue bonds,  toll road and gas tax revenue bonds,  tribal casino bonds,  and water revenue bonds.

## 5. Hybrid and Special Bond Securities

- Hybrid and special bond securities have unique security structures,  including refunded bonds,  dedicated tax-backed and structured [asset-backed](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) bonds,  insured bonds,  lease-backed bonds,  letter of credit-backed bonds,  moral obligation bonds,  territorial bonds,  troubled city bailout bonds,  and money market products.

### 5.1. Refunded Bonds

- Refunded bonds are originally issued as either revenue or general obligation bonds but are later escrowed or collateralized by securities guaranteed by the U.S. government or other types of securities.
  - These bonds are supported by the securities held in the escrow fund and have little [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md).

### 5.2. Dedicated Tax-Backed and Structured Asset-Backed Bonds

- These bonds are paid from dedicated revenues such as sales taxes,  tobacco settlement payments,  fees,  and penalty payments.
  - They mimic [asset-backed](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) bonds in the taxable market.

### 5.3. Insured Bonds

- Insured bonds are backed by insurance policies written by commercial insurance companies,  providing prompt payment to bondholders in case of default.

### 5.4. Lease-Backed Bonds

- Lease-backed bonds are structured as revenue-type bonds with annual payments,  often backed by tax revenues,  tuition payments,  or patient fees.

### 5.5. Letter of Credit-Backed Bonds

- These bonds are secured by commercial [bank letters of credit](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md),  providing additional security to bondholders.

### 5.6. Moral Obligation Bonds

- Moral obligation bonds indicate that if revenues are needed for paying bondholders,  the state legislature is authorized,  but not required,  to make an appropriation from general state tax revenues.

### 5.7. Territorial Bonds

- Territorial bonds are issued by U.S. territorial possessions such as Puerto Rico,  the Virgin Islands,  and Guam,  and are tax-exempt throughout most of the country.

### 5.8. Troubled City Bailout Bonds

- These bonds are structured to appear as pure revenue bonds but are essentially backed by general-purpose taxes and revenues to bail out issuers from budget deficits.

## 6. Money Market Products

- Tax-exempt money market products include notes,  [](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper),  variable-rate demand obligations,  and a hybrid of the last two products.

### 6.1. Notes

- Municipal notes include tax anticipation notes (TANs),  revenue anticipation notes (RANs),  grant anticipation notes (GANs),  and bond anticipation notes (BANs).
  - These are temporary borrowings by states,  local governments,  and special jurisdictions.

### 6.2. [](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper)

- Tax-exempt [](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper) is used by municipalities to raise funds on a short-term basis,  with [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) set by dealers for various maturity dates.

### 6.3. Variable-Rate Demand Obligations

- Variable-rate demand obligations (VRDOs) are floating-rate obligations with a nominal long-term maturity but a coupon rate reset daily or every seven days.

### 6.4. [](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper) Mode

- The [](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper) mode is customized to meet the cash-flow needs of an investor,  with flexibility in structuring maturity and put provisions.

## 7. Municipal Derivative Securities

- Municipal [derivative securities](../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) are created by splitting cash flows of newly issued bonds or bonds in the secondary markets into two or more bond classes.
  - These securities have different yield and [price volatility](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Black%20Models%20for%20Bond%20Price%20Options%20Capsfloors.md) characteristics than the underlying fixed-rate municipal bond.

### 7.1. Inverse Floaters

- Inverse floaters are a common type of derivative security,  with two classes of securities created from a fixed-rate bond: a floating-rate security and an inverse floating-rate bond.

## 8. Commercial Credit Rating of Municipal Bonds

- The credit rating of municipal bonds has evolved to a level of general industry acceptance and respectability.
  - However,  instances like the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) and Orange County,  California,  have caused market participants to reexamine their reliance on rating agencies.
- The Orange County [bankruptcy](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) highlighted the importance of assessing both the ability and willingness of issuers to pay,  as well as the [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) strategies used to manage operating fund investments.

## Summary

- Agency [debt securities](../Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) and municipal bonds are important components of the [fixed income](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) market,  offering a range of [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) opportunities with varying credit risks and tax advantages.
- Understanding the features,  types,  and structures of these securities is crucial for investors to assess potential [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) and risks.
- The credit rating of municipal bonds provides insights into their creditworthiness,  but investors should also consider other factors,  such as the issuer's ability and willingness to pay.

# Lecture Notes: Municipal Bond Ratings and Valuation

## 1. Introduction to Municipal Bond Ratings

- Municipal bond ratings are critical for assessing the creditworthiness of municipal bonds.
  - Ratings are provided by major [credit rating agencies](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Moody's%20Lessons%20From%20the%20Crisis.md) such as Moody's,  Standard & Poor's (S&P),  and Fitch.
  - These ratings help investors evaluate the risk associated with municipal bonds and make informed [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) decisions.
- Historically,  some municipal bonds with high-quality ratings have faced defaults,  highlighting the importance of thorough credit analysis.
  - Notable examples include the Washington Public Power Supply System and Orange County,  California.
  - Since 1975,  major municipal defaults initially had [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade ratings from Moody's and S&P.
- Despite these instances,  ratings generally reflect the condition of the credit.
  - Rating agencies have recalibrated their ratings upward for many general obligation and essential service revenue bonds,  arguing that municipal bonds should have higher ratings relative to [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md) due to historical [default rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Default%20Rates%20Recovery%20Rates%20and%20Credit%20Losses.md) and recovery levels.

## 2. Moody's Investors Service Ratings

- Moody's uses a nine-symbol system to grade the [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) quality of municipal bonds,  ranging from Aaa (highest quality) to C (lowest credit rating).
  - Bonds in the top four categories (Aaa,  Aa,  A,  and Baa) are considered [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade.
  - Speculative or noninvestment-grade ratings include Ba,  B,  Caa,  Ca,  and C.
- Moody's also provides outlook designations such as "Positive,  " "Negative,  " or "Stable" and uses the term "Watch" for potential rating changes within the next year.
- Municipal note ratings are designated by Moody's [Investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) Grade (MIG) categories,  with one speculative grade category (SG).
  - Tax-exempt [](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper) ratings include Prime 1 (P-1),  Prime 2 (P-2),  Prime 3 (P-3),  and NP (Not Prime Grade).

  - Insurance companies promised to pay [debt service](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) if the issuer defaulted.
  - The insurance was typically for the life of the bond issue.
- The appeal of municipal bond insurance diminished after the 2008 [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md),  as many insurers faced downgrades and insolvency.

## 6. Valuation Methods for Municipal Bonds

- Traditional valuation methods involve assessing the bond's maturity,  price,  call features,  and [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md).
  - Investors determine the relative attractiveness of a bond based on a yield-to-worst calculation.
  - The equivalent taxable yield formula is used to compare tax-exempt bonds with taxable bonds:
	$$\text{Equivalent taxable yield} = \frac{\text{tax-exempt yield}}{1 - \text{marginal tax rate}}$$

- The traditional method has limitations,  as it does not account for changes in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) or the actual timing of cash flows.
  - Callable municipal bonds are often priced too richly,  while noncallable bonds with extra [convexity](../Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) are undervalued.

# Lecture Notes: Municipal Bond Ratings and Valuation

## 1. Introduction to Municipal Bond Ratings

- Municipal bond ratings are critical for assessing the creditworthiness of municipal bonds.
  - Ratings are provided by major [credit rating agencies](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Moody's%20Lessons%20From%20the%20Crisis.md) such as Moody's,  Standard & Poor's (S&P),  and Fitch.
  - These ratings help investors evaluate the risk associated with municipal bonds and make informed [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) decisions.
- Historically,  some municipal bonds with high-quality ratings have faced defaults,  highlighting the importance of thorough credit analysis.
  - Notable examples include the Washington Public Power Supply System and Orange County,  California.
  - Since 1975,  major municipal defaults initially had [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade ratings from Moody's and S&P.
- Despite these instances,  ratings generally reflect the condition of the credit.
  - Rating agencies have recalibrated their ratings upward for many general obligation and essential service revenue bonds,  arguing that municipal bonds should have higher ratings relative to [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md) due to historical [default rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Default%20Rates%20Recovery%20Rates%20and%20Credit%20Losses.md) and recovery levels.

## 2. Moody's Investors Service Ratings

- Moody's uses a nine-symbol system to grade the [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) quality of municipal bonds,  ranging from Aaa (highest quality) to C (lowest credit rating).
  - Bonds in the top four categories (Aaa,  Aa,  A,  and Baa) are considered [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade.
  - Speculative or noninvestment-grade ratings include Ba,  B,  Caa,  Ca,  and C.
- Moody's also provides outlook designations such as "Positive,  " "Negative,  " or "Stable" and uses the term "Watch" for potential rating changes within the next year.
- Municipal note ratings are designated by Moody's [Investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) Grade (MIG) categories,  with one speculative grade category (SG).
  - Tax-exempt [](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper) ratings include Prime 1 (P-1),  Prime 2 (P-2),  Prime 3 (P-3),  and NP (Not Prime Grade).

- Credit ratings serve as a starting point for [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md),  but market-derived prices reflect investors' analysis of creditworthiness and marketability.
  - Insured municipal bonds historically had higher yields than noninsured superior-[investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-quality bonds.

### 8.2. Differences Between Credit Ratings

- The spread between municipal bonds of different [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) varies over time,  influenced by economic outlook,  federal budget needs,  and market supply-demand factors.

### 8.3. Differences Between In-State and General Market Bonds

- Bonds from certain states yield less than those from other states due to tax exemptions and [investor preferences](../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Preferences.md).

### 8.4. Differences Between Maturities

- The yield curve in the municipal bond market is typically normal or upward-sloping,  with long-term bonds offering higher yields than shortand intermediate-term bonds.

## 9. Primary and Secondary Markets

### 9.1. Primary Market

- New municipal bond issues are sold in the [primary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) through public offerings or private placements.
  - Public offerings may be marketed via competitive bidding or direct negotiations with underwriters.

### 9.2. Secondary Market

- Municipal bonds are traded in over-the-counter markets,  with dealer spreads depending on factors such as block size and activity level.
  - Prices are generally quoted in terms of yield,  with some exceptions for long-maturity revenue bonds.

## 10. Bond Indexes

- The Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index is a major provider of total return-based indexes for [institutional investors](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%204%20Institutional%20Trading.md).
  - Investors use these indexes to measure relative total return performance and enhance fund managers' ability to outperform the market.

## Summary

- Municipal bond ratings are essential for assessing [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md),  with major agencies providing detailed rating systems.
- Valuation methods for municipal bonds involve assessing maturity,  price,  call features,  and [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md),  with limitations in traditional approaches.
- Tax provisions,  including the treatment of OID bonds and the AMT,  affect the value of municipal bonds.
- Yield relationships within the municipal bond market are influenced by credit ratings,  state preferences,  and maturity differences.
- Understanding the [primary and secondary markets](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) for municipal bonds is crucial for investors to assess potential [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) and risks.

# Lecture Notes: Bonds,  Debentures,  and Debt Retirement Mechanisms

## 1. Introduction to Serial Issues and Equipment Trust Certificates

- Serial issues allow each maturity to be priced separately,  reflecting the yield curve's shape,  [investor preferences](../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Preferences.md),  and supply-demand considerations.
  - From an investor's perspective,  serial issues align the [repayment schedule](../../Financial%20Engineering/Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) with the depreciation of the collateral,  reducing principal repayment risk.
  - For issuers,  serial maturities enable periodic debt repayment,  reducing the risk of a large repayment crisis at maturity.
- Equipment trust certificates are a unique financing arrangement where the trustee holds the title to the equipment until all certificates are paid.
  - If the lessee (e.g.,  a railroad) fails to make lease payments,  the trustee can repossess and re-lease the equipment without legal complications.
  - These certificates are considered obligations of the lessee and appear as liabilities on its balance sheet.
  - Historically,  even during [economic downturns](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/How%20the%20Eggheads%20Cracked.md),  railroads have honored equipment trust certificates,  unlike bonds secured by mortgages.

## 2. Debenture Bonds

- Debentures are unsecured bonds,  meaning they are not backed by specific assets.
  - Debenture holders have claims on all unpledged assets and earnings of the issuer,  ranking alongside other general creditors.
  - Companies with strong financials and high credit ratings can issue debentures without offering security,  often at lower [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).
  - Debentures may include provisions to protect investors,  such as limits on additional [unsecured debt](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) or negative-pledge clauses.
- Subordinated debentures rank below secured debt and other debentures in claims on assets and earnings.
  - These bonds typically offer higher [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) due to their weaker claims.
  - Convertible debentures provide an option to convert bonds into the issuer's stock,  offering potential upside if the issuer prospers.

## 3. Guaranteed Bonds

- Guaranteed bonds are backed by another corporation's guarantee,  enhancing their creditworthiness.
  - The guarantee's safety depends on the guarantor's financial capability to fulfill the guarantee terms.
  - Multiple guarantors may share responsibility for the guaranteed amount.

## 4. Alternative Mechanisms to Retire Debt Before Maturity

- Debt retirement mechanisms can be categorized into those included in the bond's indenture and those that are not.
  - Indenture-included mechanisms: call and refunding provisions,  sinking funds,  maintenance and replacement funds,  and redemption through asset sales.
  - Non-indenture mechanisms: fixed-spread tender offers.

### 4.1. Call and Refunding Provisions

- Call provisions allow issuers to buy back bonds at a fixed price before maturity,  offering financial flexibility.
  - Fixed-price call provisions specify a call price schedule,  often starting above par and declining over time.
  - Make-whole call provisions calculate the call price as the present value of remaining cash flows,  reducing refunding motives.

### 4.2. Sinking-Fund Provision

- Sinking funds require issuers to retire a portion of the bond issue periodically,  reducing [default risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md).
  - Issuers can satisfy sinking-fund requirements through cash payments,  open-market bond purchases,  or property investments.
  - Sinking-fund provisions may include special call prices and accelerated retirement options.

### 4.3. Maintenance and Replacement Funds

- Maintenance and replacement funds ensure the integrity of collateral backing the debt,  requiring periodic property investments.
  - These funds differ from sinking funds,  focusing on maintaining rather than improving collateral value.

### 4.4. Redemption Through Asset Sales

- Bondholders expect collateral integrity,  with release-of-property clauses ensuring proceeds from asset sales are not distributed to shareholders.
  - Legal disputes may arise if bonds are redeemed under questionable circumstances,  as seen in the Texas-New Mexico Power case.

### 4.5. Tender Offers

- Tender offers allow firms to buy back debt at specified prices,  often to eliminate [Slides](Class%20[[Slides%20Note%209%20Bidask.not%20New%202020) 2 Discussion of [Loan Covenants](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Slides%202%20Discussion%20of%20Loan%20Covenants%20Vs.%20Bond%20Covenants.md) Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] or refund debt.
  - Fixed-spread tender offers calculate the tender price based on remaining cash flows and a fixed spread over Treasury yields.

## 5. Credit Risk

- [Credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) encompasses [credit default risk](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%205.md) and credit-spread risk.
  - [Credit default risk](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%205.md) is the uncertainty of timely [interest and principal](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) payments.
  - Credit-spread risk involves financial loss from changes in credit spreads,  influenced by macroeconomic and issue-specific factors.

### 5.1. Measuring Credit Default Risk

- Credit ratings from agencies like Fitch,  Moody's,  and S&P assess [credit default risk](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%205.md),  with [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade bonds rated BBB or higher.
  - Rating transition tables track changes in ratings over time,  providing insights into [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) dynamics.

### 5.2. Measuring Credit-Spread Risk

- Credit spreads reflect the yield difference between [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md) and comparable [Treasury securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md),  influenced by [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) and embedded options.
  - [Spread duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Spread%20Duration%20and%20Dvo1.md) measures the [price sensitivity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Duration.md) to credit-spread changes,  assuming constant Treasury rates.

## 6. Event Risk

- Event risk arises from corporate actions like mergers,  acquisitions,  and restructurings,  impacting bondholders' protection and debt quality.
  - Poison puts and other indenture provisions may mitigate event risk by allowing bondholders to demand redemption under specific conditions.

## Summary

- Understanding the various types of bonds,  debentures,  and debt retirement mechanisms is crucial for assessing [investment risks](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) and opportunities.
- [Credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md),  including default and spread risk,  plays a significant role in bond valuation and investor decision-making.
- Event risk highlights the importance of protective provisions in bond indentures to safeguard bondholders' interests.

# Lecture Notes: High-Yield Bonds and [Leveraged Loans](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/Note%20on%20the%20Leveraged%20Loan%20Market.md)

## 1. Introduction to High-Yield Bonds

- High-yield bonds,  also known as junk bonds,  are rated below [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) grade by rating agencies.
  - Despite the negative connotation,  not all high-yield bonds are on the verge of default or bankruptcy.
  - Many high-yield bonds are on the fringe of the [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade sector,  offering higher yields to compensate for increased risk.

## 2. Types of High-Yield Bond Issuers

### 2.1. Original Issuers

- Original issuers include young,  growing companies lacking the financial strength of established corporations but often with significant potential.
  - These are often referred to as venture-capital situations or growth companies,  with debt sold based on projected future financial strength,  known as "story bonds."
  - Established firms with financials that do not meet [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade standards but are not near [bankruptcy](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) also fall into this category.
  - Subordinated debt of [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade issuers may be included here,  with bonds rated at the bottom of [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade or top of speculative-grade referred to as "businessman's risk."

### 2.2. Fallen Angels

- Fallen angels are companies with [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade-rated debt that have experienced financial difficulties,  leading to deteriorating balance sheets and income statements.
  - These companies may be in default or near bankruptcy,  with investors interested in the workout value of the debt in a reorganization or liquidation.
  - Some refer to these issues as "special situations,  " with varying recovery outcomes over time.

### 2.3. Restructurings and [Note On LBO Capital Structure|leveraged buyouts](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Note%20On%20LBO%20Capital%20Structure%20Module%20Note.md)

- These companies have deliberately increased their debt burden to maximize shareholder value,  often through [Capital Structure](Note%20on%20LBO%20[[Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance) Module Note|Note On LBO [Capital Structure](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md)|leveraged buyouts]] ([Capital Structure](Note%20on%20LBO%20[[Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance) Module Note|Note On LBO [Capital Structure](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md)|LBOs]]).
  - In an LBO,  a new private shareholder group owns and manages the company,  with debt issued to retire other debt incurred to finance the LBO.
  - The debt to be retired is called bridge financing,  providing a bridge between initial LBO activity and more permanent financing.

## 3. Unique Features of Some High-Yield Bonds

- High-yield bonds often have deferred coupon structures to reduce the interest-payment burden on firms with heavy debt.
  - **Deferred-Interest Bonds**: Sell at a deep discount and do not pay interest for an initial period,  typically three to seven years.
  - **Step-Up Bonds**: Pay coupon interest,  but the rate is low initially and increases over time.
  - **Payment-in-Kind (PIK) Bonds**: Allow issuers to pay cash or issue additional bonds at coupon payment dates.
- Some bonds have extendible reset structures,  allowing the coupon rate to reset based on market conditions,  keeping the issue at par value.
  - However,  during high-yield market difficulties,  the rise in [default risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md) can prevent the coupon rate from maintaining the issue at the stipulated price.
- Clawback provisions allow issuers to redeem a portion of bonds during the noncall period if proceeds are from an initial public stock offering.
  - These provisions can reduce [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) in the aftermarket and merit careful attention from investors.

## 4. Default Rates and Recovery Rates

### 4.1. Default Rates

- [Default rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Default%20Rates%20Recovery%20Rates%20and%20Credit%20Losses.md) can be measured using issuer [default rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Default%20Rates%20Recovery%20Rates%20and%20Credit%20Losses.md) (number of issuers defaulting) or dollar [default rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Default%20Rates%20Recovery%20Rates%20and%20Credit%20Losses.md) (par value of defaulted bonds).
  - [Default rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Default%20Rates%20Recovery%20Rates%20and%20Credit%20Losses.md) alone are not of paramount significance,  as portfolios can suffer defaults and still outperform Treasuries if yield spreads are high enough to offset losses.

### 4.2. Recovery Rates

- Recovery rates focus on the percentage of the face amount recovered after a default,  often lower than [default rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Default%20Rates%20Recovery%20Rates%20and%20Credit%20Losses.md).
  - Measuring recovery is complex,  involving cash and securities distributions,  with present value considerations for noncash payments.

## 5. Introduction to [Leveraged Loans](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/Note%20on%20the%20Leveraged%20Loan%20Market.md)

- [Leveraged loans](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Note%20On%20LBO%20Capital%20Structure%20Module%20Note.md) are loans made to companies with speculative-grade credit ratings,  typically below BBB-/Baa3.
  - These loans are a key component of the [capital structure](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md) for below [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade companies,  often used to fund mergers,  acquisitions,  and refinance existing debt.

## 6. Syndicated Bank Loans

- [Leveraged loans](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Note%20On%20LBO%20Capital%20Structure%20Module%20Note.md) are syndicated,  involving multiple lenders providing portions of the funds under a single set of terms.
  - Syndication allows borrowers to negotiate terms once while accessing multiple lenders,  avoiding conflicts in priority.

### 6.1. Loan Structure

- Credit agreements often include a revolving line of credit and one or more [term loans](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Short-Term%20Rates%20and%20the%20Transition%20from%20LIBOR.md).
  - Loans are classified as pro rata (distributed to banks) or institutional (distributed to nonbank investors).

### 6.2. Loan Terms

- Loan terms include representations and warranties,  affirmative covenants,  and negative covenants.
  - Maintenance and incurrence requirements are common,  involving regular reviews of performance measures and specific actions triggering reviews.

## 7. Recovery Rates for [Leveraged Loans](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/Note%20on%20the%20Leveraged%20Loan%20Market.md)

- Recovery rates for [leveraged loans](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Note%20On%20LBO%20Capital%20Structure%20Module%20Note.md) are typically higher than for bonds,  with senior claims on assets.
  - Studies show average recovery rates for defaulted loans at 81% of par value,  compared to 39% for bonds.

## 8. Secondary Market for [Leveraged Loans](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/Note%20on%20the%20Leveraged%20Loan%20Market.md)

- [Leveraged loans](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Note%20On%20LBO%20Capital%20Structure%20Module%20Note.md) are private contracts,  with [secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) trading facilitated by the Loan [Pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) Corporation and the Loan Syndication and Trading Association.
  - Loans can change hands by assignment (buyer becomes lender of record) or participation (original lender remains lender of record).

## Summary

- High-yield bonds and [leveraged loans](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Note%20On%20LBO%20Capital%20Structure%20Module%20Note.md) offer higher yields to compensate for increased risk,  with various issuer types and unique features.
- Understanding [default and recovery rates](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Moody's%20Corporate%20Default%20and%20Recovery%20Rates,%20%201920-2008.md) is crucial for assessing [investment risks](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) and potential [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md).
- [Leveraged loans](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Note%20On%20LBO%20Capital%20Structure%20Module%20Note.md) play a significant role in the [capital structure](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md) of speculative-grade companies,  with syndication providing access to multiple lenders.
- The [secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) for [leveraged loans](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Note%20On%20LBO%20Capital%20Structure%20Module%20Note.md) has evolved,  with increased participation from nonbank [institutional investors](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%204%20Institutional%20Trading.md) and exchange-traded funds.

## 1. Introduction to [Leveraged Loans](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/Note%20on%20the%20Leveraged%20Loan%20Market.md)

- [Leveraged loans](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Note%20On%20LBO%20Capital%20Structure%20Module%20Note.md) are loans extended to companies with speculative-grade credit ratings,  typically below BBB-/Baa3.
  - These loans are a crucial component of the [capital structure](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md) for below [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade companies,  often used to fund mergers,  acquisitions,  and refinance existing debt.
  - The syndication of a loan from a borrower's perspective allows a corporation to negotiate loan terms only once yet gain access to multiple lenders,  avoiding possible conflicts in priority if the borrower serially negotiated loans; all lenders in the syndicate share equal rights under the credit agreement.

### 1.1. Classification of [Leveraged Loans](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/Note%20on%20the%20Leveraged%20Loan%20Market.md)

- [Leveraged loans](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Note%20On%20LBO%20Capital%20Structure%20Module%20Note.md) can be classified into two categories:
  - **Pro Rata Loans**: Distributed to banks and usually include the revolving line of credit and shorter maturity [term loans](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Short-Term%20Rates%20and%20the%20Transition%20from%20LIBOR.md).
  - **Institutional Loans**: Distributed to nonbank [institutional investors](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%204%20Institutional%20Trading.md) and typically include longer maturity [term loans](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Short-Term%20Rates%20and%20the%20Transition%20from%20LIBOR.md).

### 1.2. [Covenants](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Slides%202%20Discussion%20of%20Loan%20Covenants%20Vs.%20Bond%20Covenants.md) in [Leveraged Loans](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/Note%20on%20the%20Leveraged%20Loan%20Market.md)

- [Leveraged loans](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Note%20On%20LBO%20Capital%20Structure%20Module%20Note.md) commonly contain [Slides](Class%20[[Slides%20Note%209%20Bidask.not%20New%202020) 2 Discussion of [Loan Covenants](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Slides%202%20Discussion%20of%20Loan%20Covenants%20Vs.%20Bond%20Covenants.md) Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] or requirements that must be satisfied by borrowers:
  - **Maintenance Requirements**: Regular reviews of operating measures.
  - **Incurrence Requirements**: A review of specific operating measures after an issuer has taken an action to trigger a review.
  - Purposes of such loan terms include:
	- Preservation of collateral.
	- Appropriation of excess [cash flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md).
	- Control of business risk.
	- Performance requirements.
	- Reporting requirements.

### 1.3. Recovery Rates

- Studies of recovery rates confirm that the senior claim of bank loan lenders on the assets of the borrower,  as measured by recovery rates as a percentage of par value,  is higher than that for other creditors.
  - It is important to keep in mind that such recovery rates are expressed in percentage terms of par value so that loans trading at par are exposed to greater loss than those trading under par in the event of a default.
  - Recovery rates tend to vary meaningfully by year.

### 1.4. Secondary Market for [Leveraged Loans](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/Note%20on%20the%20Leveraged%20Loan%20Market.md)

- There are two methods by which loans in the [secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) change hands:
  - **Assignment**: The buyer becomes the lender of record with all related rights and powers.
  - **Participation**: The buyer receives the right to repayment,  but the original lender remains the lender of record. In this case,  the buyer bears a greater [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) since there is no contractual link between the borrower and the participant.
- The proliferation of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in recent years has increased access to the [leveraged loan market](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/Note%20on%20the%20Leveraged%20Loan%20Market.md). When comparing various trading characteristics of benchmark high-yield bond and leveraged loan ETFs,  we find similar relationships to those that exist in the high-yield and leveraged loan cash markets—loans tend to offer less yield and lower upside potential,  but by various metrics tend to have less risk.

## 2. Introduction to Structured Notes and Credit-Linked Notes

- [Structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) and credit-linked notes (CLNs) are [debt instruments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) that provide customized interest or principal payments that depend on the performance of a specified reference asset,  market price,  index,  interest rate,  or some other market quantity.
  - They enable investors to express a view on the future performance of the reference item as part of their [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) management program or protect their other assets against adverse changes in the value of the underlying item as part of their [risk management](../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) program.

### 2.1. Characteristics of Structured Notes

- A structured note combines a conventional fixed-rate or floating-rate note with an embedded derivative instrument,  such as an option or a swap,  which links the payments on the note to the reference item.
- [Structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) provide investors with [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) opportunities that they might find difficult or expensive to access in other ways—for example,  because of transaction costs,  regulatory restrictions,  or other market frictions.
- Generally,  any derivative instrument can be structured either as a stand-alone financial instrument,  such as a swap or a forward,  or it can be attached to a conventional note to form a structured note.

### 2.2. Credit-Linked Notes (CLNs)

- A credit-linked note (CLN) is a particular form of structured note in which the derivative instrument is a [credit default swap](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) or some other form of credit derivative.
- CLNs have been very popular since the mid-1990s,  soon after the [credit derivatives](../../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) market first began to develop.
- The volume of CLNs issued in the U.S. market increased significantly until the [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) in 2007,  which caused a reduction in issuance.

### 2.3. Types of Structured Notes

- [Structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) have been designed to provide exposure to a wide range of financial risks,  such as changes in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md),  foreign exchange rates,  stock prices,  the value of market indices,  [commodity prices](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Primary%20vs.%20Secondary%20Commodities.md),  and [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md).
- Examples include:
  - **Inverse Floating-Rate Notes**: These notes have a coupon reset formula in which [Basis Swap](A%20Guide%20to%20the%20Front%20End%20and%20[[Basis%20Swaps) Markets#[London Interbank Offered Rate](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Short-Term%20Rates%20and%20the%20Transition%20from%20LIBOR.md) (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] is subtracted from a fixed percentage rate. As [Basis Swap](A%20Guide%20to%20the%20Front%20End%20and%20[[Basis%20Swaps) Markets#[London Interbank Offered Rate](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Short-Term%20Rates%20and%20the%20Transition%20from%20LIBOR.md) (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] increases,  the coupon payment decreases,  and vice versa.
  - **Range Floating-Rate Notes**: These notes make interest payments only when the specified interest rate stays within a stated range.
  - **Yield Curve Accrual Notes**: These notes accrue interest at an above-market fixed annual rate but only when the slope of the yield curve is within a specified range.
  - **[Currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)-Linked Notes**: These notes have payments linked to the performance of a specified foreign exchange rate or a basket of currencies.

# Lecture Notes: Structured Notes and Credit-Linked Notes

## 1. Introduction to Structured Notes

- [Structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) are [financial instruments](../../Financial%20Instruments/A%20Practical%20Guide%20for%20Actuaries%20and%20other%20Business%20Professionals..md) that combine a conventional fixed-rate or floating-rate note with an embedded derivative instrument.
  - These notes provide customized interest or principal payments based on the performance of a specified reference asset,  market price,  index,  interest rate,  or other market quantity.
  - [Structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) enable investors to express views on market conditions or manage risks through tailored [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) products.

### 1.1. Currency-Linked Notes

- [Currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)-linked notes are structured by combining a note with a [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) derivative.
  - The payments on a [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)-linked note depend on the performance of a specified foreign exchange rate.
  - Issuers can hedge their risk exposure by taking offsetting positions in [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) options.

### 1.2. Equity-Linked Notes

- Equity-linked notes are structured by combining a note with an equity derivative.
  - Payments are determined by the return on the underlying equity derivative,  which could be a single stock,  a basket of stocks,  or an equity index.
  - These notes may offer principal protection,  ensuring the return of the original [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) if the underlying equity declines.

### 1.3. Commodity-Linked Notes

- Commodity-linked notes are created by combining a note with a commodity derivative.
  - Payments depend on the performance of the underlying commodity or a specified basket of [commodities](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md).
  - These notes can provide principal protection,  returning the original [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) if the commodity price declines.

## 2. Risks of Structured Notes

- [Structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) carry various risks in addition to those specific to the embedded derivative instrument.
  - **[Credit Risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md)**: [Structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) are typically senior unsecured notes,  exposing investors to the issuer's [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md).
  - **[Market Risk](../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%205%20-%20Index%20Futures.md)**: The embedded derivative instrument introduces additional market risks,  which can be quantified using financial models.
  - **[Liquidity Risk](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md)**: [Structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) are generally less liquid than conventional notes,  with limited [secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) trading.
  - **Early Redemption Risk**: Issuers may have the discretion to redeem notes early,  affecting the investor's yield.
  - **Systemic Risk**: [Structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) are exposed to systemic risk due to their ties to derivative markets.

## 3. Why Investors Buy Structured Notes

- Investors purchase [structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) when the risk/return profile matches their [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) needs and is not otherwise available in the capital market.
  - **Enhanced Yield**: [Structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) offer the potential for above-market [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md).
  - **Administrative Efficiency**: They simplify the [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) process compared to separate transactions involving notes and [derivatives](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md).
  - **Diversification and [Hedging](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)**: [Structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) facilitate [portfolio diversification](../../Financial%20Engineering/2.%20Forwards,%20Swaps,%20Futures,%20and%20Options.md) and [risk management](../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md).
  - **Customization**: Investors can tailor [structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) to align with their market views and risk tolerance.

## 4. Principal-Protected Structured Notes

- Principal-protected [structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) (PPNs) guarantee the return of at least 100% of invested capital,  provided the notes are held to maturity.
  - PPNs offer [downside protection](../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Equity%20Linked%20Note.md) while allowing for potential gains from the underlying assets.
  - The Lehman Brothers [bankruptcy](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) highlighted the importance of evaluating the issuer's creditworthiness,  as PPNs can become worthless if the issuer defaults.

## 5. Credit-Linked Notes

- Credit-linked notes (CLNs) are [structured notes](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) with payments dependent on the occurrence of a defined [credit event](../../Financial%20Engineering/Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md).
  - CLNs combine a conventional note with a [credit default swap](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) (CDS) or other credit derivative.
  - They allow issuers to [transfer credit risk](../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) exposure to investors,  who receive higher yields in return.

### 5.1. Characteristics of Credit-Linked Notes

- CLNs are often issued by high-grade banks or special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) to minimize [default risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md).
- They provide credit protection similar to CDSs but with reduced contract [default risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md).

### 5.2. Combining CLNs and CDSs

- Issuers can design [structured products](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) combining CLNs and CDSs to meet both issuer and investor requirements.
- The SPV structure insulates investors from issuer [default risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md) by holding high-quality collateral.

## 6. Emerging Market Credit-Linked Notes

- Emerging market CLNs are tied to the creditworthiness of lower-rated sovereign credits.
  - They offer higher yields to compensate for increased counterparty and [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) risks.
  - These notes are attractive to investors seeking exposure to emerging market debt without direct [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in the underlying bonds.

## 7. Synthetic CDO Credit-Linked Notes

- [Synthetic collateralized debt obligations](../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Pricing%20&%20Risk%20Management%20of%20Synthetic%20CDOs.md) (SCDOs) are a form of CDO that invests in CDSs or other assets to gain exposure to a [fixed income](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).
  - SCDOs are structured into tranches with varying risk exposures,  allowing investors to select based on their risk tolerance.
  - Combining SCDOs and CLNs can reduce counterparty risk and provide higher [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md).

### 1.1. Liquidity and Market Dynamics

- [](Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper|CP) is highly liquid due to its short maturity,  making it appealing to short-term [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) pools such as money market mutual funds.
  - However,  the [secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) for [](Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper|CP) is limited,  with [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) primarily dependent on the ability to sell back to the original dealer or issuer.
  - During market stress,  [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) can be constrained,  leading to potential funding challenges for issuers.

### 1.2. Regulatory Treatment

## 2. Floating-Rate Securities

- Floating-rate securities,  or floaters,  are [debt instruments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) with variable coupon rates tied to a reference rate such as [Basis Swap](A%20Guide%20to%20the%20Front%20End%20and%20[[Basis%20Swaps) Markets#[London Interbank Offered Rate](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Short-Term%20Rates%20and%20the%20Transition%20from%20LIBOR.md) (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] or Treasury bills.
  - Floaters are issued across various sectors,  including government,  corporate,  and municipal markets.

### 2.1. General Features and Product Types

- A floater's coupon rate is reset periodically based on a reference rate plus a quoted margin.
  - Common reference rates include LIBOR,  Treasury bill yields,  and prime rates.
  - Floaters may have [caps and floors](../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20%20Pricing%20of%20Caps%20and%20Floors.md),  limiting the range of coupon rate fluctuations.

### 2.2. Inverse Floaters and Special Features

- Inverse floaters have coupon rates that move inversely to the reference rate,  offering unique risk-return profiles.
  - Special features like stepped-spread floaters and range notes provide additional customization for investors.

### 2.3. Call and Put Provisions

- Floaters may include call or put provisions,  allowing issuers or investors to redeem the security before maturity.
  - Call provisions benefit issuers by enabling refinancing at lower rates,  while put provisions protect investors from rising margins.

### 2.4. Spread Measures

- Spread measures such as spread for life,  adjusted simple margin,  and discount margin assess the potential return from holding a floater.
  - These measures account for factors like premium/discount,  cost of carry,  and expected reference rate paths.

### 2.5. Price Volatility Characteristics

- The [price volatility](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Black%20Models%20for%20Bond%20Price%20Options%20Capsfloors.md) of floaters is influenced by changes in market rates and the presence of embedded options.
  - Sophisticated valuation models,  such as [arbitrage](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md)-free [binomial](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/A%20Real-Life%20Option%20Pricing%20Exercise.md) [interest rate trees](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%2010-%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives.md),  are used to account for interest-rate-dependent cash flows.

# Lecture Notes: Floaters,  Inverse Floaters,  and Inflation-Linked Bonds

## 1. Introduction to Floaters

- Floaters,  or floating-rate securities,  are [debt instruments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) with coupon rates that reset periodically based on a reference rate,  such as [Basis Swap](A%20Guide%20to%20the%20Front%20End%20and%20[[Basis%20Swaps) Markets#[London Interbank Offered Rate](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Short-Term%20Rates%20and%20the%20Transition%20from%20LIBOR.md) (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] or Treasury bills.
  - The periodic reset of the coupon rate reduces the floater's sensitivity to changes in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md),  making them more "defensive" securities.
  - However,  this does not mean that a floater's price will not change; several factors can affect its price.

### 1.1. Factors Affecting a Floater's Price

- A floater's price will change depending on the following factors:
  1. **Time Remaining to the Next Coupon Reset Date**: The longer the time to the next coupon reset date,  the more a floater behaves like a fixed-rate security,  and the greater is a floater’s potential price fluctuation. Conversely,  the shorter the time between coupon reset dates,  the smaller is the floater's potential price fluctuation.
  2. **Changes in the Market's Required Margin**: At the initial offering of a floater,  the issuer will set the quoted margin based on market conditions so that the security will trade near par. Subsequently,  if the market requires a higher/lower margin,  the floater’s price will decrease/increase to reflect the current margin required.
  3. **Whether or Not the Cap or Floor Is Reached**: For a floater with a cap,  once the coupon rate as specified by the coupon formula rises above the cap rate,  the floater then offers a below-market coupon rate,  and the floater will trade at a discount. The situation is reversed if the floater has a floor.

### 1.2. Duration of Floaters

- [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) is a measure of a security's [price sensitivity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Duration.md) to changes in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md). For floaters,  two measures are employed to estimate sensitivity:
  - **Index [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)**: Measures the floater's [price sensitivity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Duration.md) to changes in the reference rates holding the quoted margin constant.
  - **[Spread Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Spread%20Duration%20and%20Dvo1.md)**: Measures a floater's [price sensitivity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Duration.md) to a change in the "quoted margin" or "spread" assuming the reference rate remains unchanged.

## 2. Price Volatility of an Inverse Floater

- An [inverse floater](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) can be created by acquiring a fixed-rate security and splitting it into a floater and an [inverse floater](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md).
  - The fixed-rate security from which the floater and [inverse floater](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) are created is called the collateral.
  - The [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of an [inverse floater](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) is a multiple of the [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the collateral from which it is created. This is because the [inverse floater](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) is effectively a leveraged position in the collateral.

### Example: Duration of an Inverse Floater

::: {.callout-note}

#### Example: Duration of an Inverse Floater

Suppose a 30-year fixed-rate bond with a market value of $100 million is split into a floater and an inverse floater with market values of $80 million and $20 million,  respectively. Assume the [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the collateral is 8.

1. For a 100 basis point change in required yield,  the collateral's value will change by approximately 8%,  or $8 million.
2. Since the floater and [inverse floater](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) are created from the collateral,  the combined change in value of the floater and the [inverse floater](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) must be $8 million for a 100 basis point change in required yield.
3. If the [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the floater is small,  the [inverse floater](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) must experience the full force of the $8 million change in value. For this to occur,  the [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the [inverse floater](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md) must be approximately 40.

A [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of 40 will mean a 40% change in the [inverse floater](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Interest%20Rate%20and%20Yield%20Curve-Based%20Structured.md)’s value for a 100 basis point change in required yield and a change in value of approximately $8 million (40% times $20 million).

## 3. Portfolio Strategies Using Floaters

- Several [portfolio strategies](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) have been employed using floaters,  including:
  1. **Basic Asset/Liability Management Strategies**: Depository institutions typically borrow short term and invest in floating-rate products to lock in a spread over their short-term funding costs.
  2. **Risk [Arbitrage Strategies](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets%201.md)**: Money managers use [leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) to invest in agency adjustable-rate pass-through securities that earn a higher spread over their borrowing rate.
  3. **Betting on Changes in the Required Margin**: Investors speculate on whether a floater's required margin will change.
  4. **[Arbitrage](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) Between Fixed and Floating-Rate Markets Using Asset Swaps**: Involves the creation of synthetic security via the purchase of an existing security and the simultaneous execution of a swap.

- The [London Interbank Offered Rate](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Short-Term%20Rates%20and%20the%20Transition%20from%20LIBOR.md) (LIBOR) has served as the benchmark reference rate for various [financial instruments](../../Financial%20Instruments/A%20Practical%20Guide%20for%20Actuaries%20and%20other%20Business%20Professionals..md). However,  due to scandals and the outdated methodology for calculating [Basis Swap](A%20Guide%20to%20the%20Front%20End%20and%20[[Basis%20Swaps) Markets#[London Interbank Offered Rate](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Short-Term%20Rates%20and%20the%20Transition%20from%20LIBOR.md) (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rates,  regulators have demanded a move to an observable market-based index.
  - The Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARCC) selected the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (SOFR) as the new benchmark interest rate for all dollar-denominated loans and securities.
  - SOFR is derived from transactions in the overnight repo markets,  making it a daily rate as opposed to LIBOR,  which has varying terms ranging from one day to one year.
  - The transition to SOFR is underway,  with some [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) issuing securities and contracts that reference SOFR.

## 5. Introduction to Inflation-Linked Bonds

- [Inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-linked bonds,  such as Treasury [Inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-Protected Securities (TIPS),  are bonds that promise to protect and grow investors’ purchasing power by adjusting the principal based on changes in the [consumer price index](../../Financial%20Instruments/Pricing%20an%20Inflation%20Swap.md) (CPI).
  - TIPS offer a defensive hedge against [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md),  providing tactical and strategic advantages to investors.
  - The U.S. Treasury launched the TIPS program in 1997,  and these securities have become an important [investment instrument](../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Equity%20Linked%20Note.md).

### 5.1. Mechanics and Measurement of TIPS

- The principal and interest repaid to investors fluctuate based on the level of the CPI,  maintaining the purchasing power of each payment.
  - The real yield of TIPS is fixed,  representing the growth in purchasing power that a hold-to-maturity investor will earn.
  - TIPS pay interest semiannually at one-half their stated annual coupon rate,  with the [inflation-indexed](../../Chinese%20Financial%20System.md) principal accrued daily.

### 5.2. Real Yield and Break-Even Inflation Rate

- **Real Yield**: Represents the annualized growth rate of purchasing power earned by holding the security to maturity.
- **Break-Even [Inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) Rate**: The rate that results in the holder of a TIPS "breaking even" with the holder of a nominal bond. It is calculated as the difference between the nominal yield of a conventional bond and the real yield of TIPS.

### 5.3. Real and Effective Duration

- **Real [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)**: Measures the percentage change in TIPS' market value associated with a 1.0% change in its real yield.
- **Effective [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)**: Used to compare TIPS’ risk with that of nominal bonds,  measuring sensitivity to changes in [nominal interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md).

## Summary

- Floaters and inverse floaters offer unique [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) opportunities with varying price sensitivities to [interest rate changes](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke-Chapter%2012%20to%20Chapter%2014.md).

## 2. Historical Context and Market Dynamics

### 2.1. A Brief History of TIPS

- TIPS are such a fundamental economic instrument that they predate nominal bonds and even coins.
  - In ancient Mesopotamia,  warehouse receipts referencing quantities of grains and other goods were traded in a [secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) and were in some ways preferred to the [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) of the day.
  - In the United States,  TIPS date back to the birth of the nation,  with Massachusetts issuing debt in 1780 that was indexed to the cost of a basket of goods.

### 2.2. Quotation and Settlement

- In the United States,  TIPS are quoted on a “real clean” basis,  meaning that prices are quoted on the basis of 100 [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-adjusted units of principal.
  - The [quoted price](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%201/Accrued%20Interest.md) 95-20 can be interpreted as 95 and 20/32 real dollars,  meaning that the investor is paying $95.625\%$ of the indexed [principal amount](../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/HSBC-Auto%20callable%20Barrier%20Notes%20with%20Step-up%20Premium.md).
  - To calculate the clean settlement price,  which is paid in “nominal dollars,  ” multiply the real price by the index ratio.

### 2.3. Liquidity

- TIPS are less liquid than conventional coupon Treasuries,  but as measured by the [Bid and Ask](Class%20Note%209%20[[Class%20Note%209%20Bid%20and%20Ask%20Prices%20With%20Private%20Information) Prices With Private Information|[bid-ask spread](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Bid%20Ask%20and%20Transaction%20Prices%20in%20a%20Specialist%20Market%20With%20Heterogeneously%20Informed%20Traders.md)]] associated with transacting $50 million,  they are more liquid than most [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md),  nonagency mortgage pass-through bonds,  and even some agency debentures.

## 3. Valuation and Performance Dynamics

- The holding-period return of a TIPS bond is the sum of its yield and capital gains,  with changes in real yield determining capital gains.
  - Over the long term,  real yields in the United States are expected to remain below 2.0%,  with historical averages for long-term Treasury bonds just above 2% and short-term Treasury bills just below 1%.

### 3.1. Determinants of Inflation and the Taylor Rule

- Professor John Taylor of Stanford University presents a thesis linking the sustainable real economic growth rate and the sustainable real [federal funds rate](../../International%20Finance/Economic%20Stabilization%20Notes/Topics%20in%20Fiscal%20and%20Monetary%20Policies%20and%20Stabilization-%20Empirical%20Issues.md).
  - The [Taylor rule](../../International%20Finance/Economic%20Stabilization%20Notes/Topics%20in%20Fiscal%20and%20Monetary%20Policies%20and%20Stabilization-%20Empirical%20Issues.md) argues that over the long term,  the real [federal funds rate](../../International%20Finance/Economic%20Stabilization%20Notes/Topics%20in%20Fiscal%20and%20Monetary%20Policies%20and%20Stabilization-%20Empirical%20Issues.md) should average the long-term real economic growth rate of the economy,  estimated to be about 2%.

## 4. Tactical and Strategic Use of ILBs

### 4.1. Tactical Use

- Investors can benefit from understanding how to evaluate and purchase TIPS for tactical gain,  comparing them with [debt instruments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) with similar credit,  effective [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md),  and [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md).
  - Tactical opportunities exist in the international market for ILBs,  with global ILBs belonging to the same asset class.

### 4.2. Strategic Use

- Strategic allocations to ILBs are more deliberate and speak to the inherent [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) qualities of ILBs,  such as matching liabilities,  diversifying risks,  controlling downside exposures,  and achieving real return objectives.

## 5. Asset/Liability Management (ALM)

- ALM focuses on reducing the mismatch between assets and liabilities,  with TIPS providing a reprieve for managing both assets and liabilities that are predominantly real.
  - Surplus management optimizes the return and risk of surplus (assets net of liabilities).

## 6. Issuers of ILBs

- Governments are the largest issuers of ILBs,  with the U.S. Treasury's rationale for issuing TIPS including reducing the future interest burden of the Treasury’s debt and providing market-based [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) forecasts for use by [the Fed](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md).

### 6.1. International Issuers

- The ILB market in the United Kingdom is large and well developed,  comprising about 20% of outstanding debt.
  - Other countries,  including Canada,  Australia,  France,  Italy,  and Sweden,  have issued ILBs in large enough quantities to ensure reasonable [market liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Trading%20and%20Liquidity.md).

## 7. Corporate Issuers and CPI Floaters

- U.S. corporations,  agencies,  and municipalities have issued [inflation-indexed](../../Chinese%20Financial%20System.md) bonds,  with some structuring their bonds as CPI floaters.
  - A CPI floater is a hybrid between TIPS and a conventional floating-rate note (FRN),  with its return closely linked to CPI [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md).

## 8. Taxation and Deflation Protection

- U.S. TIPS are taxed similarly to zero-coupon bonds,  incurring a tax liability on phantom income.
  - In a deflationary environment,  the Treasury guarantees that the investor will not receive less than the original [principal amount](../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/HSBC-Auto%20callable%20Barrier%20Notes%20with%20Step-up%20Premium.md) at maturity.

## Summary

- [Inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-Linked Bonds (ILBs) offer a hedge against [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md),  maintaining the purchasing power of investments.
- Understanding the mechanics,  risks,  and valuation methods of ILBs is crucial for informed [investment decision](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%201%20Introduction%20to%20Securities%20Trading%20and%20Markets.md)-making.
- Governments are the largest issuers of ILBs,  with strategic and tactical opportunities available in both domestic and international markets.

- [Inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-Linked Bonds (ILBs),  such as Treasury [Inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-Protected Securities (TIPS) in the United States,  are designed to protect investors from [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) by adjusting the principal and interest payments based on changes in a specified [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) index,  typically the [Consumer Price Index](../../Financial%20Instruments/Pricing%20an%20Inflation%20Swap.md) (CPI).
  - ILBs offer a defensive hedge against [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md),  providing both tactical and strategic advantages to investors.
  - The U.S. Treasury launched the TIPS program in 1997,  and these securities have become an important [investment instrument](../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Equity%20Linked%20Note.md).

### 1.1. Mechanics and Measurement of TIPS

- The principal and interest repaid to investors fluctuate based on the level of the CPI,  maintaining the purchasing power of each payment.
  - The real yield of TIPS is fixed,  representing the growth in purchasing power that a hold-to-maturity investor will earn.
  - TIPS pay interest semiannually at one-half their stated annual coupon rate,  with the [inflation-indexed](../../Chinese%20Financial%20System.md) principal accrued daily.

### 1.2. Real Yield and Break-Even Inflation Rate

- **Real Yield**: Represents the annualized growth rate of purchasing power earned by holding the security to maturity.
- **Break-Even [Inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) Rate**: The rate that results in the holder of a TIPS "breaking even" with the holder of a nominal bond. It is calculated as the difference between the nominal yield of a conventional bond and the real yield of TIPS.

### 1.3. Real and Effective Duration

- **Real [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)**: Measures the percentage change in TIPS' market value associated with a 1.0% change in its real yield.
- **Effective [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)**: Used to compare TIPS’ risk with that of nominal bonds,  measuring sensitivity to changes in [nominal interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md).

## 2. Historical Context and Market Dynamics

### 2.1. A Brief History of TIPS

- TIPS are such a fundamental economic instrument that they predate nominal bonds and even coins.
  - In ancient Mesopotamia,  warehouse receipts referencing quantities of grains and other goods were traded in a [secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) and were in some ways preferred to the [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) of the day.
  - In the United States,  TIPS date back to the birth of the nation,  with Massachusetts issuing debt in 1780 that was indexed to the cost of a basket of goods.

### 2.2. Quotation and Settlement

- In the United States,  TIPS are quoted on a “real clean” basis,  meaning that prices are quoted on the basis of 100 [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-adjusted units of principal.
  - The [quoted price](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%201/Accrued%20Interest.md) 95-20 can be interpreted as 95 and 20/32 real dollars,  meaning that the investor is paying $95.625\%$ of the indexed [principal amount](../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/HSBC-Auto%20callable%20Barrier%20Notes%20with%20Step-up%20Premium.md).
  - To calculate the clean settlement price,  which is paid in “nominal dollars,  ” multiply the real price by the index ratio.

### 2.3. Liquidity

- TIPS are less liquid than conventional coupon Treasuries,  but as measured by the [Bid and Ask](Class%20Note%209%20[[Class%20Note%209%20Bid%20and%20Ask%20Prices%20With%20Private%20Information) Prices With Private Information|[bid-ask spread](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Bid%20Ask%20and%20Transaction%20Prices%20in%20a%20Specialist%20Market%20With%20Heterogeneously%20Informed%20Traders.md)]] associated with transacting $50 million,  they are more liquid than most [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md),  nonagency mortgage pass-through bonds,  and even some agency debentures.

## 3. Valuation and Performance Dynamics

- The holding-period return of a TIPS bond is the sum of its yield and capital gains,  with changes in real yield determining capital gains.
  - Over the long term,  real yields in the United States are expected to remain below 2.0%,  with historical averages for long-term Treasury bonds just above 2% and short-term Treasury bills just below 1%.

### 3.1. Determinants of Inflation and the Taylor Rule

- Professor John Taylor of Stanford University presents a thesis linking the sustainable real economic growth rate and the sustainable real [federal funds rate](../../International%20Finance/Economic%20Stabilization%20Notes/Topics%20in%20Fiscal%20and%20Monetary%20Policies%20and%20Stabilization-%20Empirical%20Issues.md).
  - The [Taylor rule](../../International%20Finance/Economic%20Stabilization%20Notes/Topics%20in%20Fiscal%20and%20Monetary%20Policies%20and%20Stabilization-%20Empirical%20Issues.md) argues that over the long term,  the real [federal funds rate](../../International%20Finance/Economic%20Stabilization%20Notes/Topics%20in%20Fiscal%20and%20Monetary%20Policies%20and%20Stabilization-%20Empirical%20Issues.md) should average the long-term real economic growth rate of the economy,  estimated to be about 2%.

## 4. Tactical and Strategic Use of ILBs

### 4.1. Tactical Use

- Investors can benefit from understanding how to evaluate and purchase TIPS for tactical gain,  comparing them with [debt instruments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) with similar credit,  effective [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md),  and [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md).
  - Tactical opportunities exist in the international market for ILBs,  with global ILBs belonging to the same asset class.

### 4.2. Strategic Use

- Strategic allocations to ILBs are more deliberate and speak to the inherent [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) qualities of ILBs,  such as matching liabilities,  diversifying risks,  controlling downside exposures,  and achieving real return objectives.

## 5. Asset/Liability Management (ALM)

- ALM focuses on reducing the mismatch between assets and liabilities,  with TIPS providing a reprieve for managing both assets and liabilities that are predominantly real.
  - Surplus management optimizes the return and risk of surplus (assets net of liabilities).

## 6. Issuers of ILBs

- Governments are the largest issuers of ILBs,  with the U.S. Treasury's rationale for issuing TIPS including reducing the future interest burden of the Treasury’s debt and providing market-based [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) forecasts for use by [the Fed](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md).

### 6.1. International Issuers

- The ILB market in the United Kingdom is large and well developed,  comprising about 20% of outstanding debt.
  - Other countries,  including Canada,  Australia,  France,  Italy,  and Sweden,  have issued ILBs in large enough quantities to ensure reasonable [market liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Trading%20and%20Liquidity.md).

## 7. Corporate Issuers and CPI Floaters

- U.S. corporations,  agencies,  and municipalities have issued [inflation-indexed](../../Chinese%20Financial%20System.md) bonds,  with some structuring their bonds as CPI floaters.
  - A CPI floater is a hybrid between TIPS and a conventional floating-rate note (FRN),  with its return closely linked to CPI [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md).

## 8. Taxation and Deflation Protection

- U.S. TIPS are taxed similarly to zero-coupon bonds,  incurring a tax liability on phantom income.
  - In a deflationary environment,  the Treasury guarantees that the investor will not receive less than the original [principal amount](../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/HSBC-Auto%20callable%20Barrier%20Notes%20with%20Step-up%20Premium.md) at maturity.

## Summary

- [Inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-Linked Bonds (ILBs) offer a hedge against [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md),  maintaining the purchasing power of investments.
- Understanding the mechanics,  risks,  and valuation methods of ILBs is crucial for informed [investment decision](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%201%20Introduction%20to%20Securities%20Trading%20and%20Markets.md)-making.
- Governments are the largest issuers of ILBs,  with strategic and tactical opportunities available in both domestic and international markets.

# Lecture Notes: Sovereign Debt Markets

## 1. Introduction to Sovereign Debt Markets

- Sovereign debt refers to the debt issued by the highest level of government in a particular country.
  - There are two types of central government securities issued: discount and coupon—and the instruments that can be issued include fixed-rate bonds,  floating-rate bonds,  and [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-adjusted bonds.
  - The three distribution methods used in the primary sovereign debt markets are (1) auctions,  (2) syndications/underwriting,  and (3) tap sales.
  - For countries with well-developed markets,  the primary distribution method is an auction.

### 1.1. Auctions

- Many sovereigns use either a single-price auction (also called a uniform price auction) or a multiple price auction (also called a discriminatory auction) for all marketable securities it issues.
  - In a multiple price auction,  competitive bidders state the amount of the securities desired and the yields they are willing to accept.
  - The yields are then ranked from lowest to highest (which is equivalent to arranging the bids from the highest price to the lowest price).
  - Starting from the lowest yield bid,  all competitive bids are accepted until the amount to be distributed to the competitive bidders is completely allocated.
  - The highest yield accepted by the sovereign is called the “stop yield,  ” and bidders at that yield are awarded a percentage of their total tender offer.
  - The single-price auction proceeds in the same fashion except that all accepted bids are filled at the highest yield of accepted competitive tenders.
  - The frequency of auctions is a function of the [debt management](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Understanding%20Debt%20Crises%20and%20Their%20Management.md) practices of the government and the desire to promote a liquid [secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md).
  - Short-term securities,  such as bills,  are usually auctioned weekly.
  - In most countries,  the day of the week for the auction is fixed.
  - Longer-term coupon securities,  such as notes and bonds,  are typically auctioned less frequently,  usually monthly or quarterly.
  - A well-defined schedule announced in advance is believed to lead to a lower effective borrowing cost.

### 1.2. Syndication

- In markets where there are few bidders,  the auction method for distributing new issues may not be the best method.
  - In such cases,  [central governments](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke%20-%20Chapter%204%20&%20Chapter%205.md) appoint a group of [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) who for a negotiable fee will subscribe to the purchase of the bond issue and then resell the bonds to other investors.
  - This process,  called syndication,  offers the advantage of reducing placement risk when demand for the securities is very uncertain and when the central government seeks to introduce a new debt instrument.
  - Syndication’s main disadvantage is the [lack of transparency](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Replication%20and%20Strategy%20Indexes.md) relative to an auction.
  - An alternative method for selling government securities is via underwriting.
  - With this method for the distribution of new securities,  the central government establishes a minimum price for a debt issue to be sold.
  - For a commission,  the underwriter subscribes to the entire issue at the minimum price.
  - The underwriter can then retain the portion of the issue it desires and resells the remainder to other investors.

### 1.3. Tap Sales

- A tap sale is a method of distributing securities that allows issuers to sell additional bonds from past issues.
  - The bonds are sold at their current market price but retain their original face value,  coupon rate,  and maturity.
  - The British and French governments have issued additional securities using this method.
  - Advantages to the issuer include avoiding some of the fixed costs of auctioning off new securities.
  - This method is used for issuing small amounts of securities when the cost of a new issue is prohibitive.

## 2. Secondary Market

- In the [secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md),  sovereign bonds can be traded directly from investor to investor,  or through a broker or primary dealer to facilitate the transaction.
  - The major participants in secondary government bond markets globally are large [institutional investors](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%204%20Institutional%20Trading.md) and central banks.
  - The participation of retail investors in the [secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) is small.
  - There are two main ways for secondary markets to be structured: as an organized exchange or as an [over-the-counter market](../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20%20Pricing%20of%20Caps%20and%20Floors.md).
  - A hallmark of a liquid,  well-developed market is how it handles spot transactions (i.e.,  a transaction for the immediate purchase or sale of a security).
  - An important gauge of a market's efficiency is the amount of time between trade execution and settlement.
  - The shorter the gap,  the more cash-like securities become.
  - Settlement is the process that occurs after the trade is made.
  - The bonds are delivered to the buyer for payment is received from the seller.
  - For most developed secondary markets,  [cash settlement](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Swaptions.md) is standard (i.e.,  when trading and settlement occur the same day).
  - Trades clear within either or both of the two main clearing systems,  Euroclear and Clearstream.
  - Settlement occurs by means of a simultaneous exchange of bonds for cash on the books of the clearing system.
  - An electronic bridge connecting Euroclear and Clearstream allows the transfer of bonds from one system to the other.

## 3. Sovereign Credit Risk

- Sovereign debt exposes investors to [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md).
  - Over history,  we could observe several cycles of sovereign debt defaults.
  - These defaults usually came in waves or clusters over time,  as Exhibit 16-2 shows based on data collected by Reinhart and Rogoff.
  - It is important to distinguish between domestic and external debt.
  - Domestic debt is issued under national jurisdiction and is typically denominated in the national [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).
  - Domestic [debt instruments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) are usually,  but not exclusively,  held by residents of the issuing country.
  - External debt,  however,  is subject to the jurisdiction of foreign creditors or international laws,  is typically issued in foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) and held by foreign residents.
  - In many cases,  it is assumed that domestic debt is not at risk whatsoever,  given that the sovereign can always print money to pay its debt back.
  - To service external,  foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)-denominated debt,  however,  a country needs access to foreign currencies. If the country runs out of foreign reserves and cannot generate sufficient foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) inflows by exporting goods or issuing new debt,  there is a very obvious technical reason to default.

### 3.1. History of Sovereign Defaults

- In reality,  domestic debt defaults occurred in the past,  although less frequently than external defaults,  as shown in the exhibit.
  - Beyond a de jure default on domestic debt,  we can also consider hyperinflation as a form of default.
  - In such cases,  while the government formally pays its obligations back,  the purchasing power of the repaid debt is significantly less than when it was borrowed.
  - Based on historical experience,  countries that issue a large portion of their debt with short maturity are usually more prone to face difficulties rolling over their debt during market panics or [economic downturns](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/How%20the%20Eggheads%20Cracked.md),  and thus are more prone to default.
  - From the creditor's perspective,  short-maturity debt is a means to force borrowers to follow prudent economic policies,  and also is a result of [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) fatigue,  as short-maturity debt is much harder to inflate away than long-maturity debt.
  - Nevertheless,  even a country with a sustainable debt profile can run into a rollover or debt [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) crises during recessions and market panics.
  - These types of [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) crises have been largely reduced by international organizations like the IMF or the World Bank that can provide loans when private lenders would not be able or willing to do so.

### 3.2. Sovereign Ratings

- Sovereign ratings are credit ratings for countries as assigned by one or more credit rating agency (CRA).
  - The three major CRAs are Moody’s Investors Service,  Standard & Poor's Ratings Services,  and Fitch Ratings.
  - Two CRAs that rate sovereign debt and have the status of a Nationally Recognized Statistical Organization by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are the Japan Credit Rating Agency and DBRS Morningstar.
  - Other CRAs that include Scope Ratings (a German-based CRA) and two Chinese-based CRAs,  Dagong Global Credit Rating and China Chengxin Credit Rating Group.
  - Sovereign ratings are assessments of the relative likelihood that a borrower (i.e.,  a central government) will default on its obligations.
  - Governments seek these credit ratings to increase their access to international capital markets.
  - Sovereign ratings matter to investors because other things equal investors prefer rated issues to unrated ones.
  - They matter to borrowers as well because the rating agencies are reluctant to assign a credit rating to a lower level of government or corporation that is higher than that of the issuer's home country.
  - Two sovereign debt ratings are assigned by [credit rating agencies](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Moody's%20Lessons%20From%20the%20Crisis.md),  a local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt rating and a foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt rating.
  - The two general categories of risk analyzed in assigning ratings are economic risk and political risk.
  - The former category is an assessment of the ability of a government to satisfy its obligations.
  - Both quantitative and qualitative analyses are used in assessing economic risk.
  - Political risk is an assessment of the willingness of a government to satisfy its obligations.
  - A government may have the ability but may be unwilling to pay.
  - Political risk is assessed based on qualitative analysis of the political factors that influence a government's economic policies.
  - The reason for distinguishing between local debt ratings and foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt ratings is that historically,  the default frequency differs by the [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) denomination of the debt.
  - Specifically,  defaults have been greater on foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)-denominated debt.
  - The reason for the difference in [default rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Default%20Rates%20Recovery%20Rates%20and%20Credit%20Losses.md) for local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt and foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt is that if a government is willing to raise taxes and control its domestic [financial system](../../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md),  it can generate sufficient local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) to meet its local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt obligation.
  - This is not the case with foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)-denominated debt.
  - A national government must purchase foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) to meet a debt obligation in that foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) and therefore has less control with respect to its exchange rate.
  - Thus,  a significant depreciation of the local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) relative to a foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) in which a debt obligation is denominated will impair a national government's ability to satisfy such obligation.
  - This distinction is not observed with the 17 countries of the European Union's Eurozone,  where there is only a single credit rating for a sovereign’s issues irrespective of what [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) the country is issuing.
  - A country whose domestic [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) is a liquid [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  and which boasts a sizeable domestic institutional savings base,  has the capacity to fund its debt in local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).
  - However,  where there is a demand for that issuer’s name,  either from foreign investors and/or for issues in another [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  a sovereign may also issue in a foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).
  - When this occurs,  it will usually swap the proceeds into its local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).
  - A demand for a particular sovereign name from different investors may cause that issuer to raise debt in a foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md); this is common for highly rated borrowers such as Switzerland,  Finland,  and Sweden,  which issue U.S. dollar and euro debt.
  - The factors analyzed in assessing the creditworthiness of a national government's local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt and foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt will differ to some extent.
  - In assessing the [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) of local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt,  for example,  Standard & Poor's emphasizes domestic government policies that foster or impede timely [debt service](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md).
  - In assigning a rating for a country's foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt,  credit analysis by S&P focuses on the interaction of domestic and foreign government policies.
  - S&P analyzes a country's [balance of payments](../../International%20Finance/The%20Balance%20of%20Payments.md) and the structure of its external balance sheet.
  - The areas of analysis with respect to its external balance sheet are the net public debt,  total net external debt,  and net external liabilities.
  - Moody’s,  another major rating agency,  focuses on the following four factors as the foundation of its sovereign bond ratings methodology: (1) economic strength (wealth,  size,  diversification,  and long-term potential),  (2) institutional strength (governance,  quality of institutions,  and policy predictability),  (3) government financial strength (ability to deploy resources to face current and expected liabilities),  and (4) susceptibility to event risk (risk of sudden risk migration).

## 4. Sovereign Bond Yield Spreads

- There are several studies on the sovereign yield spreads.
  - The focus of most studies is on the importance of a country's fiscal [fundamentals](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md) on the observed yield spread on sovereign bonds for advanced economies.
  - Several empirical studies for advanced economies find that fiscal [fundamentals](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md) and [default risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md) are not the key drivers of sovereign yield spreads.
  - A European Central Bank study by Afonso,  Arghyrou,  and Kontonikas,  however,  did find that macroeconomic and expected fiscal [fundamentals](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md),  international risk,  [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) conditions,  and sovereign credit ratings (particularly in the case of a [rating downgrade](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md)) did have an impact over three time periods: (1) the period preceding the global credit crunch (January 1999-July 2007),  (2) the period during which the global credit crunch had not yet transformed into a [sovereign debt crisis](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) (August 2007-February 2009),  and (3) the period during which the [global financial crisis](../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) transformed into a [sovereign debt crisis](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) (March 2009-December 2010).
  - The study looked at 10 euro area countries (Austria,  Belgium,  Finland,  France,  [Greece](../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/Solutions/PSET%203%20Solution-Financial%20Instruments.md),  Ireland,  Italy,  Netherlands,  Portugal,  and Spain).
  - Empirical studies do suggest that a key determinant of sovereign yield spread is global market conditions that reflect the risk aversion of global investors rather than conditions specific to a country.
  - This is due to the global financial integration that results in [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) adjustments by global investors,  clearly demonstrated during a [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) where there is a flight to countries viewed as a safe haven.
  - Nevertheless,  when there is an economic crisis for a specific country investors become concerned with domestic risk.
  - There are studies that looked at more than just fiscal variables and [default risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md) in investing observed sovereign yield spreads.
  - These studies look at some proxies for investor [expectations](../Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) about fiscal development for a country.
  - For example,  deficit forecasts and potential government liabilities (e.g.,  the position of the domestic [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) sector if it had to be rescued) have been used.
  - Most of the earlier studies examined observed yield spreads.
  - Since 2013,  as a result of data available on forecasts of fiscal variables based on survey forecasts,  studies have used forecasts to explain sovereign bond yield spreads.
  - For example,  a study by the European Central Bank by Cimadomo,  Claeys,  and Poplawski-Ribeiro used survey data to investigate how [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) forecast sovereign yield spreads.
  - They use monthly survey forecasts for three countries (France,  Italy,  and the U.K.) between January 1993 and December 2011 to investigate whether survey respondents consider the expected evolution of a country's fiscal balance,  as well as other economic [fundamentals](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md),  are determinants of the expected (as opposed to observed) bond yield spreads over a benchmark German 10-year bond.
  - One-year-ahead forecasts for a country's budget balance,  [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate,  and GDP are used as a proxy for a country’s fiscal development.
  - They find that the expected sovereign yield spread is significantly impacted by the forecasted improvement for a country’s fiscal development.
  - Overall,  the findings suggest that credible fiscal plans affect [expectations](../Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) of market experts,  reducing the pressure on sovereign bond markets.

## 5. Sovereign Bonds from the Investor's Perspective

- Investors may choose to invest in foreign sovereign bonds for various reasons and it is also common to bucket foreign sovereign bonds into “developed market” and "emerging market categories.
  - From a U.S. investor's perspective,  developed market sovereign bonds,  as well as bonds issued by supranational organizations like the World Bank,  were historically added to [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) portfolios to diversify the risk of the U.S. yield curve.
  - Furthermore,  return enhancement had been a consideration as well,  especially when foreign sovereign yields exceeded U.S. Treasury yields,  like 10-year German bund offered higher yield than 10-year U.S. Treasuries in the early 1990s,  2002,  or around 2008-2009.
  - As discussed in Chapter 1,  many bonds of the highest-rated foreign sovereign issuers currently offer very low or even negative yield,  so many investors consider U.S. Treasuries more attractive than those bonds issued by Germany or Switzerland in the present conditions.
  - That said,  besides pure diversification,  foreign developed market sovereign bonds still play important roles in the market:
	- Central banks and other official organizations hold a significant portion of their reserves in the highest-rated sovereign bonds.
	- Based on IMF data,  central banks altogether held $12.2 trillion in assets as of April 2020,  and while the U.S. dollar remains the main global reserve [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  about 39% of global central bank reserves is comprised by non-U.S. dollar assets.
	- Foreign reserve [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) allocation,  and thus allocation to foreign sovereign bonds,  is based on various factors,  like economic connections with different [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) blocks; thus European countries outside the Eurozone would typically have high allocation to euro-denominated bonds.
	- Outside of central bank reserve managers,  other investors like pension funds may add foreign sovereign bonds to their portfolios on a [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) unhedged or hedged basis.
	- If foreign sovereigns are added to on a [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) unhedged basis,  [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) risk (and [currency diversification](../../International%20Finance/China%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves/Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia/Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves.md)) would be a main contributor to the fixed-income [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) risk.
	- If,  however,  foreign sovereign bonds are added on a [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) hedged basis,  while volatility gets reduced,  investors also have to take the cost of [hedging](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) into consideration.
	- Based on the [covered interest rate parity](../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md),  a [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) with higher [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) than the same maturity U.S. [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) would be traded at a discount [forward price](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) compared to the spot FX rate,  whereas a [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) with lower [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) would have a forward premium versus the U.S. dollar [spot rate](../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md).
	- For example,  while a Japanese government bond offers lower yield than the same maturity U.S. Treasury,  if the Japanese [short-term interest rate](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Gauss%20Model.md) is even more lower than the comparable U.S. interest rate,  the carry on the Japanese bonds may be attractive on a [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) hedged basis as the investor sells Japanese yen forward at a premium price.
	- When investing in foreign bonds on a [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) hedged basis,  the difference in the yield curve slopes matter.
	- Emerging market sovereign bonds are mainly added to the [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) for return enhancement.
	- [J.P. Morgan](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/WSJ-Excerpts%20From%20the%20Lehman%20Report.md) Global Emerging Market Bond Index,  an index comprised of USD-denominated emerging market sovereign and agency bonds,  had a spread of 4.63% over U.S. Treasuries at the end of May 2020.
	- Given low yield levels in developed markets,  investors may consider the addition of emerging market sovereign bonds as an attractive return enhancer.
	- About 60% of this index is,  in fact,  comprised of [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade bonds,  there is no [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) risk in this index since all these bonds are USD-denominated,  but the [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) is high,  over seven years,  so both yield or spread level increases would adversely impact the index performance.
	- Local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) denominated emerging market bonds have gained importance over the recent decade as well; investors would typically add such bonds on a [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) unhedged basis,  since [hedging](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) high-interest-rate emerging market currencies would have a negative carry based on the logic of the [covered interest rate parity](../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md).

## 6. Key Points

- Sovereign debt refers to the debt issued by the highest level of government in a particular country.
- There are two types of central government securities issued: discount and coupon—and the instruments that can be issued include fixed-rate bonds,  floating-rate bonds,  and [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-adjusted bonds.
- The three distribution methods used in the primary sovereign debt markets are (1) auctions,  (2) syndications/underwriting,  and (3) tap sales.
- For countries with well-developed markets,  the primary distribution method is an auction.
- Two sovereign debt ratings are assigned by [credit rating agencies](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Moody's%20Lessons%20From%20the%20Crisis.md) (a local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt rating and a foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt rating).
- The two general categories of risk analyzed by [credit rating agencies](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Moody's%20Lessons%20From%20the%20Crisis.md) in assigning ratings are economic risk and political risk.

# Lecture Notes: Emerging Markets Debt

## 1. Introduction to Emerging Markets (EMs)

- Emerging markets (EMs) comprise nations whose economies are viewed as developing,  or emerging,  from underdevelopment.
  - These nations usually include almost all of Africa,  Central and Eastern Europe,  Latin America,  Russia,  the Middle East,  and Asia (excluding Japan).
  - There is no single definition of EMs.
  - Some define them as countries that do not have G10 currencies,  though that might classify some AAA-rated countries as EM.
  - EM status is not defined solely by region,  nor low credit rating,  as many EMs are now [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) grade.
  - Since the early 2000s emerging economies,  which had previously depended on foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) external debt funding,  started focusing on opening their local debt markets to foreign investors,  as well.
  - Many of these countries are heavily dependent on commodity exports,  whereas others have extensive service and manufacturing sectors.
  - EM debt includes sovereign bonds and loans issued by governments,  as well as fixed-income securities issued by public and private companies domiciled in EM countries.
  - The assets could be denominated in any [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).
  - Many of these countries had defaulted on commercial bank loans in the 1980s and began the 1990s by converting the defaulted loans to restructured sovereign foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) bonds,  known as Brady bonds.
  - While the early to middle 1990s might be thought of as the era when defaulted foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) loans were restructured into global bonds,  the late 1990s onward will be thought of as the era when defaulted bonds were restructured into new bonds and local markets opened up to foreign investors.
  - We discuss the market,  the evolution of the asset class,  the growth of local debt markets,  the macro [fundamentals](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md) that drive sovereign performance,  debt sustainability considerations,  the compensation provided by spreads,  and the issues surrounding defaults,  as well as provide a background on selected past defaults and restructurings.
  - The asset class is distinct from the majority of developed market [international investing](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%208/Week%208%20Opportunities%20And%20Risks%20Of%20Investing%20Internationally.md) because the largest and most liquid foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) bonds are primarily sovereigns bonds,  and there is no [bankruptcy](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) court for sovereign external debt and countries can institute capital controls that affect all local debt.

## 2. The Debt Universe

- EMs’ tradable debt stock grew almost 1100%,  or 15% per year,  from 2000 to about $US$26 trillion 20 years later.
  - The vast majority of that growth has been in local debt and [corporate debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md).
  - This is partly due to foreign [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) inflows that helped EM countries grow their economies (Exhibit 17-1).

### 2.1. Domestic versus External Debt

- Domestic debt is issued locally and is governed by the local laws of the issuing country.
  - Domestic debt is usually denominated in local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) and may also be called local debt or local debt markets (LDM).
- External debt (EXD) is issued externally and is governed by the laws of a foreign country.
  - It is denominated in foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  primarily U.S. dollars and euros,  and may be called foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt (FC).
- Foreign investors initially focused only on external debt.
  - The outstanding face value of external EM bonds is close to $3.9 trillion,     of which $2.7 trillion is [corporate debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) and $1.2 trillion is sovereign debt.
  - The vast majority of growth in external debt has been through the issuance of [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md) or sovereign global and Eurobonds,  terms that are often used interchangeably.
  - External [corporate debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) has been growing faster than external sovereign debt.
- Domestic debt has become an increasing share of all debt,  now over $22 trillion,     or 85% of the total EM tradable debt universe (Exhibit 17-2),     up from $2 trillion in 2000.
  - The lower [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md),  frequent [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) restrictions,  varied practices,  and higher convertibility risk make trading in domestic bonds more difficult for foreign investors than trading in external bonds.
  - However,  the potential for significant [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) gains due to the decline in local [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) from highly inflationary and high yielding periods,  coupled with [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) appreciation was a driver for significant growth in assets invested in local markets.

## 3. Debt Stock by Region

- Latin America originally dominated the external tradable debt universe,  but with increased issuance in other regions,  the breakdown of outstanding external debt has become fairly evenly distributed.
  - Asia now represents 47% of total debt outstanding,  with Latin America at 25%,  Emerging Europe at 14%,  and the Middle East and Africa at 14%.
  - Tradable debt here excludes nontradable debt such as International Monetary Fund (IMF) loans but is not necessarily liquid debt.
  - Tradable debt should not necessarily be considered debt qualifying for benchmark indices,  which we describe below,  because the latter has an additional requirement of access for foreigners,  [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) for valuation purposes,  and other constraining criteria.
  - The growth in debt has been primarily driven by higher issuance of domestic sovereign debt and external [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md),  mainly from China.
  - In local debt,  Asia dominates with 78% of the tradable domestic debt,  primarily driven by the debt of China and India.
  - China alone has 56% of the domestic debt.
  - Asia is followed by Latin America with 14% of the domestic debt.
  - In the Asian markets,  local debt is 90% of all debt in Asia,  and in Latin America local debt is 77% of the total debt.

## 4. External Debt Markets

- Both the stock of external debt outstanding per country and the number of issuing countries have grown since the early 1990s when countries began to issue foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) bonds (Exhibit 17-2).

### 4.1. Size of Market

- External debt markets are now dominated by [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md),  but sovereign debt still dominates local markets.
  - External debt issuance has been running at around $600 billion annually,     25% sovereign and 75% corporate,     provincial and quasi-sovereign,     compared with $30 billion during the early 1990s.
  - There is more than $4 trillion of outstanding tradable external debt in 2020,     versus $1 trillion in 2000.
  - Corporate issuance has been increasing in general as corporate borrowers now enjoy wide access to the international capital markets.

### 4.2. Diversification of Issuers

- The increase in the number of countries from which sovereign and [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md) have been issued has been beneficial to investors seeking diversification and whose [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) performance is benchmarked against an index.
  - The larger number of issuers has reduced the concentration of the largest countries in any of the major EM indices.
  - Major market indices of external debt include outstanding external sovereign debt with sufficient [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) to provide daily [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md).
  - External bonds have few trading restrictions and historically have been of great interest to the broadest range of foreign investors.
  - The number of EM countries which issue external debt has increased from 4 in 1991 to close to 80 by 2020.
  - This is a result of large countries with foreign commercial bank loans converting those loans to bonds and smaller countries beginning to tap the external debt markets.
  - The countries with the largest number of bonds in sovereign and corporates are in Exhibits 17-3 and 17-4.

## 5. Benchmark EM Sovereign and Corporate Indices

- EM sovereign and [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md) totaling $2.5-3 trillion are eligible for inclusion in EM indices.
  - This is larger than the entire $2.3 trillion [market capitalization](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Price-to-Sales%20Ratios%20in%20Stock%20Valuation.md) of the ICE BofA Global High Yield Index.

### 5.1. Sovereigns Are About 40%,  Corporates 60% of EM External Debt Indices

- The three most frequently used family of benchmark indices are the [JPMorgan](../../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) EMBI Global (EMBIG) index of sovereign and quasi-sovereigns,  the Bloomberg Barclays EM Aggregate Index (EMUSTRUU) of USD sovereigns and corporates,  and the ICE BofA EMs External Sovereign Index (EMGB) of EUR and USD bonds.
  - Each of those indices have a sovereign market value near $1 trillion as of 2020.
  - A majority of investors use modified indices that limit the size of the largest countries,  so that a credit problem with one issuer does not have an excessively adverse impact on index or [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) performance.
  - While there is no unique definition,  most investors consider a company to be a “quasi-sovereign" if the government owns more than 50% of its equity.
  - Often,  such quasis are of such strategic government importance that investors expect them to have an implicit government guarantee,  if needed.
  - Quasi sectors are mainly in oil and gas,  but also in metals and mining,  utilities,  and finance.
  - The JPM index includes USD sovereign and quasi-sovereigns that are 100% owned by the government,  such as Pemex.
  - The ICE BofA index includes only sovereign issuers,  not quasi-sovereign,  from countries that do not issue a G-10 [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).
  - The ICE BofA index includes also EUR-denominated debt.
  - The five largest countries comprise about 30% of the indices today compared to 98% of the index at inception in 1993.

## 6. Corporate Debt Growth

- The EM corporate bond market is one of the fastest growing asset classes globally,  at $1.6 trillion index eligible debt in 2020 from just $74 billion 20 years earlier.
  - In each corporate index family,  about two-thirds of the [market capitalization](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Price-to-Sales%20Ratios%20in%20Stock%20Valuation.md) is comprised of [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) grade bonds.

### 6.1. Top 10 Countries: Corporate Debt Index Face Value (EMCB Index)

- Over the last three decades,  Eastern European,  African,  Middle Eastern,  and Asian markets have gained market share.
  - Asia dominates the [market capitalization](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Price-to-Sales%20Ratios%20in%20Stock%20Valuation.md),  mainly from China’s large issuance of quasi-sovereign bonds after 2010.
  - This has left Latin America with only 26% of the [market capitalization](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Price-to-Sales%20Ratios%20in%20Stock%20Valuation.md) of external debt qualifying for index inclusion,  compared to 98% at inception of the indices.
  - The most frequently used indices that include corporates are the USD [JPMorgan](../../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) CEMBI ($1.1 trillion),     the Bloomberg Barclays EM Aggregate Index that includes USD-,     EUR-,     and GBP-denominated sovereign,     quasi-sovereign,     and corporate debt from EM issuers ($2.5 trillion LG20TRUU of which $2.2 trillion is in USD) and the ICE BofA Emerging Markets EM corporate index ($1.7 trillion,  EMCB).
  - EM countries are home to Vale,  the largest iron ore company; Codelco,  the largest copper company; Bimbo,  the largest baker; JBS,  the largest meat packer; and Gazprom,  the largest gas company,  to name a few.
  - The Mexican telecommunications company,  America Movil,  is one of the largest in the world.
  - The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is the largest bank in the world.
  - Mexico’s Pemex has issued some of the most actively traded bonds in the world including among developed market [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md).
  - At one time,  rating agencies would not rate an EM corporate higher than the rating of its sovereign (this was termed a “sovereign ceiling"),  expecting that in a crisis,  a government could appropriate the foreign exchange of the corporate or prevent it from converting local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) into foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).
  - But that criterion has been relaxed.
  - Although credit analysts at one time viewed corporate bond valuations primarily based on the sovereign,  increasingly,  analysts consider a company's global peer group when determining value,  in addition to geographic location.

## 7. Credit Quality of EM Countries

- EMs have improved in [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) as an asset class.
  - This is now a diverse asset class ranging from [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade credits to defaulted debt.
  - The asset class was created from weak economies struggling to improve after the 1980s.
  - Many countries have pursued macroeconomic policies that allow them to better weather external shocks and reduce their sensitivity to changes in [capital flows](../../International%20Finance/Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md),  and their [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) has improved as a result.
  - During some periods,  EM economies have even been the growth drivers of the [global economy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Fewer%20Or%20Even%20None.md).
  - Despite the difficulties surrounding the 1997 Asian [debt crisis](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%20(2007–2011).md) and 1998 [Russian default](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md),  there have been many more positive than negative ratings actions since then.
  - Thus the percentage of [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade bonds in the major benchmark indices has risen from under 10% in the mid-1990s to close to 60-70% 25 years later.
  - [Credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) also rose by three notches from BB/Ba3 to BBB/Baa3,  when considering the rating of the index weighted by [market capitalization](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Price-to-Sales%20Ratios%20in%20Stock%20Valuation.md).

## 8. Local Debt Markets

- In the 1980s,  country [fundamentals](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md) across EMs were weak with twin fiscal and [current account](../../International%20Finance/Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) deficits,  high [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md),  large external debt stocks,  [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) crises,  and in some cases institutional uncertainty.
  - At that point,  financing needs were normally covered by external debt,  denominated in a G10 [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) and governed by New York,  London,  or Tokyo laws.
  - However,  [fundamentals](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md) started to change in the 1990s as countries implemented macroeconomic stabilization programs,  adopted a more responsible fiscal stance,  and moved away from fixed-exchange rate regimes toward floating ones.
  - In several cases,  [Risk and Return](Lecture%207-[[Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds) of Bonds#7.6 [Asset price](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) reactions to [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) surprises|[monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md)]] started to be managed using [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) targeting regimes.
  - This process led to a gradual improvement in economic [fundamentals](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md).
  - [Inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) declined and currencies became more stable.
  - Under this new backdrop investors gained confidence in buying debt denominated in local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) issued by countries and corporations in EM world.
  - Most local debt was bought by local investors,  but foreign investors have become an increasing share of holders of local debt.
  - In some countries,  foreigners now hold close to 50% of local government fixed-rate bonds.
  - Investing in local EM debt is similar to investing in any international foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) denominated bond; [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) have two main sources: local yields and local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md).
  - Because holders also incur [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) risk,  convertibility risk and other capital controls risks,  local market bond yields are normally higher than those for external debt.
  - In addition,  local yields of EM countries have traditionally been more volatile than those of developed markets,  consistent with higher volatility in [inflation](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md).
  - That said,  in the last two decades we saw a significant decline in local yields responding to better [fundamentals](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md),  higher credibility,  and/or to lower global yields.

## 9. Capital Controls

- Capital control is a policy device that a government uses to regulate the foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) flows into and out of the country,  usually used to restrict volatile movements of capital due to investor speculation.
  - Controls on inflows typically respond to the macroeconomic implications of the increasing size and volatility of capital inflows,  such as [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) appreciation,  loss of competitiveness,  and credit booms.
  - Controls on outflows are used to limit the downward pressure on their currencies and foreign reserves,  a significant risk to a local bond [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).
  - The implementation of capital controls is a key risk for foreign investors holding,  or planning to hold,  local debt.
  - Most EM countries have some form of capital controls that can be increased as needed.
  - Even countries with free convertibility of their currencies could institute capital controls if deemed necessary.
  - Capital controls normally can take the form of transaction taxes,  transfer taxes,  withholding taxes,  reserve requirements,  unremunerated reserve requirements,  multiple exchange rate systems,  and/or limitations in terms of the amount of assets to be held,  caps on volume permitted,  controls on the international sale or purchase of various financial assets,  and sometimes even limits on the amount of money a private citizen is allowed to take out of the country.
  - As the IMF discussed,  the most common experiences in using capital controls are capital controls to limit short-term inflows,  capital outflow controls during financial crises,  and extensive exchange controls during financial crises.

## 10. Convertibility Risk

- Convertibility,  or transfer,  risk is the risk that a government will restrict the conversion of local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) into foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) or restrict the transfer of foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) out of the country.
  - In other words,  it is the risk that an investor will not be able to repatriate the cash flows of the [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md),  normally due to exchange restrictions imposed by a government.
  - Drastic measures may occur during crises.
  - Several such examples are:
	- Korea,  1997: Daily [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) move was limited to 5% and the [FX market](../../International%20Finance/Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) would shut down after that level was reached.
	- Russia,  1998: Banks froze dollar withdrawals and the central bank terminated the fixing of the [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) in the Moscow International [Currency Exchange](../../Clippings/Currency%20Swap%20Basics.md) auctions.
	- Argentina,  2001 and 2019: Authorities limited domestic residents access to dollars and required exporters to sell dollar proceeds promptly after collection.
	- Venezuela,  2003: Limited ability of locals and foreign companies to convert bolivars into U.S. dollars.
	- Brazil,  2008-2013: The government adopted an IOF tax on foreign inflows for specific financial transactions,  but the tax moved back to zero in 2013.

## 11. Investing in Local Debt Markets

- As discussed above,  investors can gain exposure to local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) by buying a local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) instrument in a particular market.
  - To do so,  an investor would have to send funds to the country,  convert it into local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  and then buy a local debt instrument.
  - While this process appears simple,  there are several nuances that need to be managed.
  - Countries have different regulations,  laws,  and limits for foreign [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md),  typically including the need to set up a local account,  hire a local custodian,  report activity to the local regulator,  and pay taxes if applicable.
  - Also,  each country has its own requirements: some countries limit the amount and/or the type of bonds that foreign investors can hold; others impose taxes on capital inflows,  have minimum holding periods,  or intervene heavily in the [foreign exchange market](../../International%20Finance/Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md),  and so on.

## Summary

- Emerging markets (EMs) offer diverse [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) opportunities,  with significant growth in local and [corporate debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) markets.
- Understanding the risks,  regulations,  and market dynamics of EM debt is crucial for informed [investment decision](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%201%20Introduction%20to%20Securities%20Trading%20and%20Markets.md)-making.
- Capital controls and convertibility risk are key considerations for foreign investors in EM local debt markets.

# Lecture Notes: Emerging Markets Debt

## 1. Introduction to Emerging Markets (EMs)

- Emerging markets (EMs) are nations with developing economies,  often characterized by rapid growth and industrialization.
  - These nations typically include regions such as Africa,  Central and Eastern Europe,  Latin America,  Russia,  the Middle East,  and Asia (excluding Japan).
  - There is no single definition of EMs,  but they are generally distinguished by their economic development status and market potential.
  - EMs are not solely defined by geographic location or low credit ratings,  as many have achieved [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade status.
  - Since the early 2000s,  EMs have increasingly focused on opening their local debt markets to foreign investors,  moving away from reliance on foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) external debt.
  - Many EMs are heavily dependent on commodity exports,  while others have diversified into services and manufacturing sectors.
- EM debt includes sovereign bonds and loans issued by governments,  as well as fixed-income securities issued by public and private companies domiciled in EM countries.
  - These assets can be denominated in any [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  with a significant portion historically issued as U.S. dollar-denominated loans to EM governments.
  - The asset class has evolved from defaulted commercial bank loans in the 1980s to restructured sovereign foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) bonds,  known as Brady bonds,  in the 1990s.
  - The late 1990s onward saw the restructuring of defaulted bonds into new bonds and the opening of local markets to foreign investors.

## 2. The Debt Universe

- EMs' tradable debt stock grew by approximately 1100% from 2000 to around $26 trillion over 20 years,  with significant growth in local and [corporate debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md).
  - This growth has been driven by foreign [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) inflows that have supported EM economic development.

### 2.1. Domestic versus External Debt

- **Domestic Debt**: Issued locally and governed by local laws,  typically denominated in local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). Also known as local debt or local debt markets (LDM).
- **External Debt (EXD)**: Issued externally and governed by foreign laws,  primarily denominated in foreign currencies such as U.S. dollars and euros. Also known as foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt (FC).
- Foreign investors initially focused on external debt,  with the outstanding face value of external EM bonds close to $3.9 trillion,     including $2.7 trillion in [corporate debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) and $1.2 trillion in sovereign debt.
  - The majority of growth in external debt has been through [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md) and sovereign global and Eurobonds.
  - Domestic debt has become an increasing share of all debt,  now over $22 trillion,     or 85% of the total EM tradable debt universe,     up from $2 trillion in 2000.

## 3. Debt Stock by Region

- Latin America originally dominated the external tradable debt universe,  but increased issuance in other regions has led to a more balanced distribution.
  - Asia now represents 47% of total debt outstanding,  with Latin America at 25%,  Emerging Europe at 14%,  and the Middle East and Africa at 14%.
  - The growth in debt has been primarily driven by higher issuance of domestic sovereign debt and external [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md),  mainly from China.
  - In local debt,  Asia dominates with 78% of the tradable domestic debt,  primarily driven by China and India.

## 4. External Debt Markets

- Both the stock of external debt outstanding per country and the number of issuing countries have grown since the early 1990s.

### 4.1. Size of Market

- External debt markets are now dominated by [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md),  but sovereign debt still dominates local markets.
  - External debt issuance has been around $600 billion annually,  with 25% sovereign and 75% corporate,  provincial,  and quasi-sovereign.
  - There is more than $4 trillion of outstanding tradable external debt in 2020,     compared to $1 trillion in 2000.

### 4.2. Diversification of Issuers

- The increase in the number of countries issuing sovereign and [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md) has benefited investors seeking diversification.
  - The larger number of issuers has reduced the concentration of the largest countries in major EM indices.
  - Major market indices of external debt include outstanding external sovereign debt with sufficient [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) for daily [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md).
  - The number of EM countries issuing external debt has increased from 4 in 1991 to close to 80 by 2020.

## 5. Benchmark EM Sovereign and Corporate Indices

- EM sovereign and [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md) totaling $2.5-3 trillion are eligible for inclusion in EM indices,     larger than the entire $2.3 trillion [market capitalization](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Price-to-Sales%20Ratios%20in%20Stock%20Valuation.md) of the ICE BofA Global High Yield Index.

### 5.1. Sovereigns Are About 40%,  Corporates 60% of EM External Debt Indices

- The three most frequently used benchmark indices are the [JPMorgan](../../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) EMBI Global (EMBIG) index of sovereign and quasi-sovereigns,  the Bloomberg Barclays EM Aggregate Index (EMUSTRUU) of USD sovereigns and corporates,  and the ICE BofA EMs External Sovereign Index (EMGB) of EUR and USD bonds.
  - Each of these indices has a sovereign market value near $1 trillion as of 2020.
  - A majority of investors use modified indices that limit the size of the largest countries to reduce concentration risk.

## 6. Corporate Debt Growth

- The EM corporate bond market is one of the fastest-growing asset classes globally,  with $1.6 trillion index-eligible debt in 2020,     up from $74 billion 20 years earlier.
  - About two-thirds of the [market capitalization](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Price-to-Sales%20Ratios%20in%20Stock%20Valuation.md) in each corporate index family is comprised of [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade bonds.

### 6.1. Top 10 Countries: Corporate Debt Index Face Value (EMCB Index)

- Over the last three decades,  Eastern European,  African,  Middle Eastern,  and Asian markets have gained market share.
  - Asia dominates the [market capitalization](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Price-to-Sales%20Ratios%20in%20Stock%20Valuation.md),  mainly from China's large issuance of quasi-sovereign bonds after 2010.
  - The most frequently used indices that include corporates are the USD [JPMorgan](../../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) CEMBI,  the Bloomberg Barclays EM Aggregate Index,  and the ICE BofA Emerging Markets EM corporate index.

## 7. Credit Quality of EM Countries

- EMs have improved in [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) as an asset class,  with many countries pursuing macroeconomic policies that allow them to better weather external shocks.
  - The percentage of [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade bonds in major benchmark indices has risen from under 10% in the mid-1990s to close to 60-70% 25 years later.
  - [Credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) has risen by three notches from BB/Ba3 to BBB/Baa3,  when considering the rating of the index weighted by [market capitalization](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Price-to-Sales%20Ratios%20in%20Stock%20Valuation.md).

## 8. Local Debt Markets

- In the 1980s,  EMs faced weak economic [fundamentals](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md),  but improvements in the 1990s led to increased confidence in local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt.
  - Most local debt was initially bought by local investors,  but foreign investors have become an increasing share of holders.
  - Investing in local EM debt involves [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) risk,  convertibility risk,  and other capital controls risks,  leading to higher yields compared to external debt.

## 9. Capital Controls

- Capital controls are policy devices used by governments to regulate foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) flows,  often to restrict volatile capital movements.
  - Controls on inflows address macroeconomic implications such as [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) appreciation and credit booms,  while controls on outflows limit downward pressure on currencies and reserves.
  - Capital controls can take various forms,  including transaction taxes,  reserve requirements,  and limitations on asset holdings.

## 10. Convertibility Risk

- Convertibility risk is the risk that a government will restrict the conversion of local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) into foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) or restrict the transfer of foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) out of the country.
  - This risk can arise during crises,  with examples including Korea in 1997,  Russia in 1998,  and Argentina in 2001 and 2019.

## 11. Investing in Local Debt Markets

- Investors can gain exposure to local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) by buying local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) instruments,  but must navigate regulations,  laws,  and limits for foreign [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).
  - Each country has its own requirements,  such as setting up local accounts,  hiring custodians,  and reporting activity to regulators.

## Summary

- Emerging markets (EMs) offer diverse [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) opportunities,  with significant growth in local and [corporate debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) markets.
- Understanding the risks,  regulations,  and market dynamics of EM debt is crucial for informed [investment decision](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%201%20Introduction%20to%20Securities%20Trading%20and%20Markets.md)-making.
- Capital controls and convertibility risk are key considerations for foreign investors in EM local debt markets.

# Lecture Notes: Emerging Markets Debt and Sovereign Restructurings

## 1. Introduction to Emerging Markets Debt

- Emerging markets (EMs) are nations with developing economies,  often characterized by rapid growth and industrialization.
  - These nations typically include regions such as Africa,  Central and Eastern Europe,  Latin America,  Russia,  the Middle East,  and Asia (excluding Japan).
  - EMs are not solely defined by geographic location or low credit ratings,  as many have achieved [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade status.
  - Since the early 2000s,  EMs have increasingly focused on opening their local debt markets to foreign investors,  moving away from reliance on foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) external debt.
  - Many EMs are heavily dependent on commodity exports,  while others have diversified into services and manufacturing sectors.
- EM debt includes sovereign bonds and loans issued by governments,  as well as fixed-income securities issued by public and private companies domiciled in EM countries.
  - These assets can be denominated in any [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  with a significant portion historically issued as U.S. dollar-denominated loans to EM governments.
  - The asset class has evolved from defaulted commercial bank loans in the 1980s to restructured sovereign foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) bonds,  known as Brady bonds,  in the 1990s.
  - The late 1990s onward saw the restructuring of defaulted bonds into new bonds and the opening of local markets to foreign investors.

## 2. The Debt Universe

- EMs' tradable debt stock grew by approximately 1100% from 2000 to around $26 trillion over 20 years,  with significant growth in local and [corporate debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md).
  - This growth has been driven by foreign [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) inflows that have supported EM economic development.

### 2.1. Domestic versus External Debt

- **Domestic Debt**: Issued locally and governed by local laws,  typically denominated in local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). Also known as local debt or local debt markets (LDM).
- **External Debt (EXD)**: Issued externally and governed by foreign laws,  primarily denominated in foreign currencies such as U.S. dollars and euros. Also known as foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt (FC).
- Foreign investors initially focused on external debt,  with the outstanding face value of external EM bonds close to $3.9 trillion,     including $2.7 trillion in [corporate debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) and $1.2 trillion in sovereign debt.
  - The majority of growth in external debt has been through [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md) and sovereign global and Eurobonds.
  - Domestic debt has become an increasing share of all debt,  now over $22 trillion,     or 85% of the total EM tradable debt universe,     up from $2 trillion in 2000.

## 3. Debt Stock by Region

- Latin America originally dominated the external tradable debt universe,  but increased issuance in other regions has led to a more balanced distribution.
  - Asia now represents 47% of total debt outstanding,  with Latin America at 25%,  Emerging Europe at 14%,  and the Middle East and Africa at 14%.
  - The growth in debt has been primarily driven by higher issuance of domestic sovereign debt and external [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md),  mainly from China.
  - In local debt,  Asia dominates with 78% of the tradable domestic debt,  primarily driven by China and India.

## 4. External Debt Markets

- Both the stock of external debt outstanding per country and the number of issuing countries have grown since the early 1990s.

### 4.1. Size of Market

- External debt markets are now dominated by [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md),  but sovereign debt still dominates local markets.
  - External debt issuance has been around $600 billion annually,  with 25% sovereign and 75% corporate,  provincial,  and quasi-sovereign.
  - There is more than $4 trillion of outstanding tradable external debt in 2020,     compared to $1 trillion in 2000.

### 4.2. Diversification of Issuers

- The increase in the number of countries issuing sovereign and [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md) has benefited investors seeking diversification.
  - The larger number of issuers has reduced the concentration of the largest countries in major EM indices.
  - Major market indices of external debt include outstanding external sovereign debt with sufficient [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) for daily [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md).
  - The number of EM countries issuing external debt has increased from 4 in 1991 to close to 80 by 2020.

## 5. Benchmark EM Sovereign and Corporate Indices

- EM sovereign and [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md) totaling $2.5-3 trillion are eligible for inclusion in EM indices,     larger than the entire $2.3 trillion [market capitalization](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Price-to-Sales%20Ratios%20in%20Stock%20Valuation.md) of the ICE BofA Global High Yield Index.

### 5.1. Sovereigns Are About 40%,  Corporates 60% of EM External Debt Indices

- The three most frequently used benchmark indices are the [JPMorgan](../../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) EMBI Global (EMBIG) index of sovereign and quasi-sovereigns,  the Bloomberg Barclays EM Aggregate Index (EMUSTRUU) of USD sovereigns and corporates,  and the ICE BofA EMs External Sovereign Index (EMGB) of EUR and USD bonds.
  - Each of these indices has a sovereign market value near $1 trillion as of 2020.
  - A majority of investors use modified indices that limit the size of the largest countries to reduce concentration risk.

## 6. Corporate Debt Growth

- The EM corporate bond market is one of the fastest-growing asset classes globally,  with $1.6 trillion index-eligible debt in 2020,     up from $74 billion 20 years earlier.
  - About two-thirds of the [market capitalization](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Price-to-Sales%20Ratios%20in%20Stock%20Valuation.md) in each corporate index family is comprised of [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade bonds.

### 6.1. Top 10 Countries: Corporate Debt Index Face Value (EMCB Index)

- Over the last three decades,  Eastern European,  African,  Middle Eastern,  and Asian markets have gained market share.
  - Asia dominates the [market capitalization](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Price-to-Sales%20Ratios%20in%20Stock%20Valuation.md),  mainly from China's large issuance of quasi-sovereign bonds after 2010.
  - The most frequently used indices that include corporates are the USD [JPMorgan](../../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) CEMBI,  the Bloomberg Barclays EM Aggregate Index,  and the ICE BofA Emerging Markets EM corporate index.

## 7. Credit Quality of EM Countries

- EMs have improved in [credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) as an asset class,  with many countries pursuing macroeconomic policies that allow them to better weather external shocks.
  - The percentage of [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade bonds in major benchmark indices has risen from under 10% in the mid-1990s to close to 60-70% 25 years later.
  - [Credit quality](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) has risen by three notches from BB/Ba3 to BBB/Baa3,  when considering the rating of the index weighted by [market capitalization](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Price-to-Sales%20Ratios%20in%20Stock%20Valuation.md).

## 8. Local Debt Markets

- In the 1980s,  EMs faced weak economic [fundamentals](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md),  but improvements in the 1990s led to increased confidence in local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt.
  - Most local debt was initially bought by local investors,  but foreign investors have become an increasing share of holders.
  - Investing in local EM debt involves [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) risk,  convertibility risk,  and other capital controls risks,  leading to higher yields compared to external debt.

## 9. Capital Controls

- Capital controls are policy devices used by governments to regulate foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) flows,  often to restrict volatile capital movements.
  - Controls on inflows address macroeconomic implications such as [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) appreciation and credit booms,  while controls on outflows limit downward pressure on currencies and reserves.
  - Capital controls can take various forms,  including transaction taxes,  reserve requirements,  and limitations on asset holdings.

## 10. Convertibility Risk

- Convertibility risk is the risk that a government will restrict the conversion of local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) into foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) or restrict the transfer of foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) out of the country.
  - This risk can arise during crises,  with examples including Korea in 1997,  Russia in 1998,  and Argentina in 2001 and 2019.

## 11. Investing in Local Debt Markets

- Investors can gain exposure to local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) by buying local [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) instruments,  but must navigate regulations,  laws,  and limits for foreign [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).
  - Each country has its own requirements,  such as setting up local accounts,  hiring custodians,  and reporting activity to regulators.

## 12. Sovereign Restructurings

- Sovereign [Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy](Class%20Slide%204-[[Class%20Slide%204-Restructuring%20Debt%20Outside%20Bankruptcy)|[Debt Restructuring](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Class%20Slide%204-Restructuring%20Debt%20Outside%20Bankruptcy.md) ]]s aim to provide [debt service](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) relief,  allowing the sovereign to regain market access.
  - Restructuring can involve lowering coupon rates,  extending maturities,  reducing face value,  or a combination of these measures.
  - Successful restructurings can lead to tighter spreads and improved bond prices,  creating a positive feedback loop.

### 12.1. Third-Party Support and the Role of the IMF

- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank play significant roles in sovereign [Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy](Class%20Slide%204-[[Class%20Slide%204-Restructuring%20Debt%20Outside%20Bankruptcy)|[Debt Restructuring](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Class%20Slide%204-Restructuring%20Debt%20Outside%20Bankruptcy.md) ]]s,  providing funding and support.
  - The IMF typically lends money to help sovereigns service their debt,  with conditions for fiscal and economic reforms.
  - The IMF's flexible credit line (FCL) offers less conditionality for countries with stronger [fundamentals](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md).

### 12.2. [Distressed Debt](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/A%20Primer%20on%20Distressed%20Investing.md) International Litigation

- Sovereign defaults lack a formal [bankruptcy](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) process,  leading to [Primer](A%20[[An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer) on [Distressed Investing](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/HomeMax%20Case%20Study%20Solution.md)|distressed debt]] exchanges or resumption of payments.
  - Holdout investors can disrupt restructurings by demanding payment on original terms or negotiating preferred settlements.
  - Sovereign immunity complicates asset attachment,  with legal climates varying by jurisdiction.

### 12.3. Collective Action Clauses (CACs)

- CACs define the number of bondholders needed to agree on restructuring terms,  reducing holdout risk.
  - CACs have evolved to allow aggregated voting across multiple bond series,  offering greater issuer protection.

### 12.4. Successful Debt Exchanges

- Successful exchanges involve high creditor participation and avoid default during the following five years.
  - Examples include the 2003 Uruguay exchange and the 2015 Ukraine exchange,  which set precedents for future restructurings.

## Summary

- Emerging markets (EMs) offer diverse [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) opportunities,  with significant growth in local and [corporate debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md) markets.
- Understanding the risks,  regulations,  and market dynamics of EM debt is crucial for informed [investment decision](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%201%20Introduction%20to%20Securities%20Trading%20and%20Markets.md)-making.
- Sovereign restructurings aim to provide debt relief and regain market access,  with the IMF and CACs playing key roles in facilitating orderly processes.

## 1. Introduction to Sovereign [Debt Restructuring ](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Class%20Slide%204-Restructuring%20Debt%20Outside%20Bankruptcy.md)s

- Sovereign [Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy](Class%20Slide%204-[[Class%20Slide%204-Restructuring%20Debt%20Outside%20Bankruptcy)|[Debt Restructuring](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Class%20Slide%204-Restructuring%20Debt%20Outside%20Bankruptcy.md) ]]s are complex processes aimed at providing [debt service](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) relief to sovereign nations,  allowing them to regain market access and stabilize their economies.
  - Restructuring can involve extending maturities,  lowering coupon rates,  reducing face value,  or a combination of these measures.
  - Successful restructurings can lead to tighter spreads and improved bond prices,  creating a positive feedback loop for the sovereign.

### 1.1. Uruguay's Successful Restructuring

- Uruguay's restructuring involved a voluntary exchange of USD debt,  which did not trigger credit default swaps (CDS) due to the voluntary nature of the exchange.
  - The yen Brady bond included a collective action clause,  allowing 50% of bondholders to vote to change payment terms,  which applied to 100% of bondholders.
  - This forced restructuring triggered CDS in every [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  but S&P later upgraded Uruguay's rating,  citing reduced debt amortization burden and alleviated funding pressures.

### 1.2. Argentina's Unsuccessful Exchange

- Argentina's 2001 restructuring efforts failed to avert default,  despite two large voluntary exchanges aimed at reducing near-term [debt service](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md).
  - The June 2001 "mega swap" exchanged $30 billion of debt for new bonds with capitalized interest,  but investor confidence did not increase.
  - A second exchange in November 2001 was viewed as coercive,  leading to a downgrade to default by S&P.
  - Argentina declared a moratorium on $95 billion of external debt,  breaking the [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) peg and bailing out banks,  resulting in a complex [restructuring process](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/A%20Primer%20on%20Distressed%20Investing.md).

### 1.3. Repeat Defaulters

- Some countries,  like Russia,  Ecuador,  and Ivory Coast,  have repeatedly defaulted on their debt.
  - Russia restructured Soviet-era debt in 1997 but defaulted in 1998,  later achieving [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-grade status by 2003.
  - Ecuador defaulted on Brady bonds in 1999 and selectively defaulted again in 2008.
  - Ivory Coast defaulted in 2000 but restructured in 2010,  facing political stalemates and further defaults.

## 2. Derivatives and Emerging Markets

- [Derivatives](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md),  such as credit default swaps (CDS),  play a significant role in emerging markets investing and [hedging](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md).
  - EM sovereign CDS are among the most liquid and actively traded,  with Brazil,  Turkey,  Mexico,  China,  Korea,  and South Africa being the most traded credits.
  - CDS indices,  like CDX.EM,  provide exposure to a basket of EM sovereign credits.

### 2.1. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)

- ETFs have transformed bond markets by providing transparent,  intraday [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) and targeted market exposure.

## 3. Fixed Income ETF Characteristics and Management

- [Fixed income ETFs](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) are managed funds with daily transparency of holdings and monthly income distributions.
  - The [primary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) involves the creation and redemption of fund shares by authorized participants,  maintaining [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md).
  - ETFs provide exposure to a wide array of sectors,  with minimal counterparty risk and low tracking error.

### 3.1. Index and Active ETFs

- Index ETFs seek to match the performance of a published benchmark,  using techniques like optimization and stratified sampling.
  - Active ETFs aim to outperform benchmarks through strategies like security selection and [Asset Allocation](Lecture%202-%20[[Lecture%202-%20Asset%20Allocation%20with%20Multiple%20Risky%20Assets) with [Multiple Risky Assets](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%202-%20Asset%20Allocation%20with%20Multiple%20Risky%20Assets.md)|[asset allocation](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%202-%20Asset%20Allocation%20with%20Multiple%20Risky%20Assets.md)]].
  - Both types of ETFs offer transparency and [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md),  with active ETFs providing managed alpha vehicles.

# Lecture Notes: Fixed Income ETFs and Preferred Stock

## 1. Introduction to Fixed Income ETFs

- [Fixed Income](../Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) vehicles that offer exposure to a [diversified portfolio](../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%205%20-%20Index%20Futures.md) of bonds and other [fixed income securities](../../Clippings/Bond%20Equivalent%20Yield%20(BEY)%20-%20Definition,%20Formula,%20and%20Example.md).
  - They provide investors with transparency,  [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md),  and [efficient market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%2012%20Market%20Efficiency.md) access,  combining attributes of individual bonds,  bond portfolios,  mutual funds,  swaps,  and [futures](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md).
  - [Fixed income ETFs](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) are traded on [stock exchanges](../../Financial%20Engineering/An%20Introduction%20to%20Equity%20Markets.md),  allowing investors to buy and sell shares throughout the trading day at market prices.

### 1.1. Arbitrage Mechanism

- Authorized participants (APs) play a crucial role in maintaining the [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) and price alignment of [fixed income ETFs](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md).
  - APs can purchase the underlying [fixed income securities](../../Clippings/Bond%20Equivalent%20Yield%20(BEY)%20-%20Definition,%20Formula,%20and%20Example.md),  deliver them to the ETF provider in exchange for new ETF shares,  and then sell the ETF shares in the market for a profit.
  - Conversely,  if the ETF trades below the value of its [underlying securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Rate%20and%20Price%20Trees.md),  APs can buy ETF shares in the open market,  redeem them for the underlying bond holdings,  and sell the bonds for a net profit.
  - This [arbitrage](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) mechanism ensures that the ETF price remains in line with the value of the [underlying securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Rate%20and%20Price%20Trees.md).

### 1.2. Secondary Market Liquidity

- [Fixed income ETFs](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) develop their own independent exchange [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) layer through [secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) trading.
  - This [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) layer decouples the ETF [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) from the underlying OTC bond market,  allowing investors to trade ETFs with tighter bid/offer spreads.
  - [Secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) activity accounts for the majority of ETF trading volume,  with most transactions occurring without the need to create or redeem shares.
  - During periods of market stress,  secondary trading activity can significantly exceed primary activity,  providing substantial [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md).

### 1.3. Trading Behavior and Price Discovery

- The price at which an ETF trades is influenced by the value of the [underlying securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Rate%20and%20Price%20Trees.md),  market flows,  [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md),  and [market volatility](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Class%20Slides%20On%20Terrausd%20Runs%202.md).
  - ETFs can trade at a premium or discount to their net asset value (NAV),  with the level of premium or discount reflecting the bid/offer spread of the underlying bond market and market conditions.
  - [Fixed income ETFs](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) provide real-time price discovery,  serving as an actionable vehicle and window into market conditions,  particularly when the underlying bond market is stressed.

## 2. Preferred Stock

- Preferred stock is a hybrid security that combines features of both common stocks and [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md).
  - It is considered an equity security,  with preferred stockholders having a claim on cash dividends that is senior to that of common shareholders.
  - Preferred stock dividends are typically fixed by contract,  making it similar to a perpetuity.

### 2.1. Types of Preferred Stock

- There are three main types of preferred stock:
  1. **Fixed-Rate Preferred Stock**: Pays a fixed dividend rate.
  2. **Adjustable-Rate Preferred Stock (ARPS)**: The dividend rate is reset quarterly based on a predetermined spread from the highest of three points on the Treasury yield curve.
  3. **Auction-Rate and Remarketed Preferred Stock**: The dividend rate is established through a Dutch [auction process](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%202%20Securities%20Markets.md) or determined by a remarketing agent.

### 2.2. Trust Preferred Securities

- Trust preferred securities are hybrid securities primarily issued by [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md),  treated as debt for tax purposes and equity for regulatory purposes.
  - They possess 30-year maturities with features allowing for early redemption and deliver quarterly [dividend payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md).

### 2.3. Preferred Stock Ratings and Tax Treatment

- Preferred stock is rated similarly to [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md),  with ratings assessing the issuer's ability to make timely [dividend payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md).
  - [Dividend payments](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) are treated as a distribution of earnings and are not tax-deductible to the corporation.
  - A provision in the tax code exempts 70% of qualified dividends from federal income taxation for qualified corporations,  reducing the cost differential between preferred stock and debt issuance.

## Summary

- [Fixed income ETFs](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) offer transparent,  liquid,  and efficient exposure to [fixed income markets](../../Financial%20Engineering/A%20Practical%20Guide%20to%20Bonds%20and%20Swaps.md),  with an [arbitrage](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) mechanism ensuring price alignment with [underlying securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Rate%20and%20Price%20Trees.md).
- Preferred stock provides higher yields and [diversification benefits](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%208/Week%208%20Opportunities%20And%20Risks%20Of%20Investing%20Internationally.md),  with various types offering different dividend structures and features.
- Understanding the characteristics,  risks,  and market dynamics of these instruments is crucial for informed [investment decision](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%201%20Introduction%20to%20Securities%20Trading%20and%20Markets.md)-making.

# Lecture Notes: Project Finance,  DSCR,  and Default Risk

## 1. Introduction to Project Finance and DSCR

- Project finance involves the financing of long-term infrastructure and industrial projects based on the projected cash flows of the project rather than the balance sheets of the project sponsors.
  - A key metric in project finance is the [Debt Service](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) Coverage Ratio (DSCR),  which measures the cash available to service debt (CFADS) relative to the [debt service](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) obligations (DS).
  - The DSCR provides an unambiguous definition of default in project finance,  as a "hard" default occurs when the CFADS is less than the [debt service](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) obligations.

### 1.1. Definition of Default

- A default in project finance can be defined in terms of the ex post CFADS at time \( t \) as:
  $$ \text{Default}_t \Longleftrightarrow \text{CFADS}_t < \text{DS}_t^{\text{BC}} $$
  - This can be expressed in terms of the ex post DSCR as:
  $$ \text{default}_t \Longleftrightarrow \text{DSCR}_t = \frac{\text{CFADS}_t}{\text{DS}_t^{\text{BC}}} < 1 $$
  - If the DSCR equals unity,  the project is just able to service its senior debt during the relevant period. A DSCR below unity indicates a default.

### 1.2. Credit Events and Basel II Framework

- Credit events in project finance may be defined more loosely,  such as being "past-due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation" according to the Basel II framework.
  - Unlike standard [corporate finance](../../Course%20Notes/Corporate%20Finance%20Lecture%20Notes.md),  where [Slides](Class%20[[Slides%20Note%209%20Bidask.not%20New%202020) 2 Discussion of [Loan Covenants](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Slides%202%20Discussion%20of%20Loan%20Covenants%20Vs.%20Bond%20Covenants.md) Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] typically relate to the financial state of the firm,  Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) in project finance may experience technical defaults due to a low DSCR.

## 2. Ex Ante and Ex Post DSCR

- Ex ante,  at the time of financial close,  lenders require a DSCR significantly higher than unity to create a credit-risk buffer.
  - This ensures that equity and junior distributions are made only once senior obligations have been met.
- Ex post,  if the DSCR is too low,  it may trigger remedial actions by lenders,  such as restructuring or refinancing.

### 2.1. Probability of Default

- The probability of default can be expressed as:
  $$ p_t = \text{Pr}(\text{DSCR}_t < 1. x \mid \min_{j<t} \text{DSCR}_j \geq 1. x) $$
  - This represents the conditional probability of default,  given that no default has occurred until time \( t \).

## 3. Restructurings and Embedded Options

- Restructurings in project finance often involve changes to the [capital structure](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md),  such as face value,  maturity,  or seniority.
  - These restructurings can occur in distress to avoid [bankruptcy](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) or when the project's [free cash flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2011%20-%20Individual%20Investors-A%20Survey%20of%20Modern%20Investment%20Theory/Free%20Cash%20Flow%20Valuation%20of%20Companies.md) is sufficiently high to take advantage of lower risk refinance rates.

### 3.1. Suitability of Refinancing

- The suitability of refinancing depends on the maturity of existing debt,  market conditions,  and the cost of refinancing.
  - Long-term investors may have a greater aversion to refinancing,  leading to the [introduction](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Introduction.md) of prepayment charges and fewer refinancings.

## 4. Determinants of Spreads and Pricing

- The determinants of [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) in project finance are different from other forms of [corporate debt](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md).
  - Key determinants include expected default,  uncertainty about default,  and non-[credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) factors such as [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md),  tax,  and regulatory effects.

### 4.1. Maturity and Leverage

- Longer tenors in project finance do not necessarily equate to larger spreads,  as longer-term debt can be cheaper than [short-term debt](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/When%20Safe%20Proved%20Risky%20Commercial%20Paper%20During%20the%20Financial%20Crisis%20of%202007%202009.md) due to repayment flows.
- Spreads are positively related to [leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md),  signaling a tradeoff between reduced equity contribution and increased [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md).

### 4.2. Syndicate Size and Ratings

- The size of the syndicate can influence spreads,  with larger syndicates potentially leading to lower spreads due to risk diversification.
- Ratings provide a clear-cut assessment of [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md),  with higher-rated projects generally enjoying lower spreads.

## 5. Credit Risk Management

- [Credit risk management](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20as%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) in project finance requires advanced modeling to overcome the paucity of default event data.
  - This may be a challenge for smaller investors and complicates the prudential treatment of this asset class.

### 5.1. Reduced Form Approach

- The reduced form approach involves measuring observed default frequencies within a population of loans,  relying on the concept of a "hazard rate."

### 5.2. Structural Models

- [Structural models](../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Credit%20Risk%20Models%20and%20the%20Valuation%20of%20Credit%20%20Default%20Swap%20Contracts.md) specify the default process endogenously,  linking defaults to the firm's liabilities and asset values.
  - [Merton](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%205.md)'s classic model assumes that a firm's equity resembles a call option on its assets,  with default occurring when asset value falls below debt obligations.

## Summary

- Project finance relies heavily on the DSCR as a measure of [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) and default probability.
- Restructurings and embedded options play a significant role in managing [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) and maximizing recovery.
- Understanding the determinants of spreads and [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md),  as well as advanced [credit risk management](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20as%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) techniques,  is crucial for informed [investment decision](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%201%20Introduction%20to%20Securities%20Trading%20and%20Markets.md)-making in project finance.

# Lecture Notes: Mortgage Loans,  Project Finance,  and Fixed Income Instruments

## 1. Introduction to Mortgage Loans

- Mortgage loans are a critical component of the [financial system](../../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md),  providing individuals with the means to purchase homes and other real estate.
  - These loans are typically structured as long-term [debt instruments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md),  with fixed or adjustable [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).
  - The [repayment schedule](../../Financial%20Engineering/Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) for a mortgage loan involves periodic payments that include both principal and interest.

### 1.1. Amortization and Loan Terms

- Amortization refers to the gradual repayment of a loan over time through regular payments.
  - A [fixed-rate mortgage](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Fixed-Rate%20Mortgage%20Loans.md) involves a consistent interest rate and monthly payment throughout the loan term.
  - The amortization schedule determines how much of each payment goes toward interest and how much toward principal.
  - In the early years of a mortgage,  payments are primarily composed of interest,  with the principal portion increasing over time.
- Exhibit 21-2 illustrates the allocation of principal and interest payments for a $100,  000 30-year fixed-rate loan with a 5.5% note rate.
  - The exhibit shows that the payment consists mostly of interest in the early period of the loan.
  - As the loan ages,  the payment is increasingly allocated to principal.
  - The crossover point,  where the [principal and interest components](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Fixed-Rate%20Mortgage%20Loans.md) of the payment are equal,  occurs in month 210.

### 1.2. Loan Types and Features

- Loans with shorter amortization schedules,  such as 15-year loans,  allow for faster equity buildup in the home.
  - Exhibit 21-3 compares the outstanding balance of a $100,  000 loan with a 5.5% note rate using 30and 15-year amortization terms.
  - The halfway mark for a 30-year loan is reached in month 246,  while it is reached in month 151 for a 20-year term and month 107 for a 15-year loan.
- Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) involve periodic interest rate adjustments based on market conditions.
  - The payment is recalculated at each reset,  using the new note rate and the remaining term of the loan.
  - Prepayments occur when a borrower refinances,  sells the property,  or defaults on the loan,  impacting the holder of the mortgage.

## 2. The Mortgage Industry

- The mortgage industry comprises various [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) involved in making mortgage loans,  either directly or indirectly.
  - Direct lenders underwrite and fund loans,  while third-party originations (TPOs) involve entities other than the seller.
  - Depository institutions collect deposits to fund lending activities,  while nondepository lenders sell loan production to investors.

### 2.1. Originators vs. Servicers

- Loan originators underwrite and fund loan production,  while servicers manage the collection of payments and other administrative tasks.
  - Servicers receive a fee for their services,  which is generally part of the monthly interest payment.
  - Large servicing operations benefit from economies of scale but may struggle with high volumes of delinquent loans.

### 2.2. Loan Underwriting Process

- The underwriting process involves evaluating the borrower's ability and willingness to repay the loan and ensuring the property's integrity.
  - Credit scores,  loan-to-value ratios,  and income ratios are key factors in assessing creditworthiness.
  - Documentation standards have evolved,  with the [Dodd-Frank Act](Note%20on%20The%20[[Credit%20Derivative%20Indexes) and Its Impact|[Dodd-Frank](../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/Note%20on%20The%20Dodd-Frank%20Act%20and%20Its%20Impact.md)]] Act requiring verification of the borrower's ability to repay.

## 3. Project Finance and Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)

- Project finance involves financing long-term infrastructure projects based on projected cash flows rather than the sponsors' balance sheets.
  - The [Debt Service](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) Coverage Ratio (DSCR) measures the cash available to service debt relative to [debt service](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) obligations.
  - A DSCR below unity indicates a default,  triggering remedial actions by lenders.

### 3.1. Restructurings and Embedded Options

- Restructurings in project finance may involve changes to the [capital structure](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md),  such as face value,  maturity,  or seniority.
  - The suitability of refinancing depends on market conditions and the cost of refinancing.
  - Long-term investors may have a greater aversion to refinancing,  leading to prepayment charges and fewer refinancings.

### 3.2. Determinants of Spreads and Pricing

- Key determinants of [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) in project finance include expected default,  uncertainty about default,  and non-[credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) factors.
  - Longer tenors do not necessarily equate to larger spreads,  as longer-term debt can be cheaper due to repayment flows.
  - Spreads are positively related to [leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md),  signaling a tradeoff between reduced equity contribution and increased [credit risk](../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md).

## 4. Fixed Income Instruments: Preferred Stock and Fixed Income ETFs

- Preferred stock is a hybrid security combining features of common stocks and [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md),  offering fixed dividends.
  - [Fixed income ETFs](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) provide exposure to a [diversified portfolio](../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%205%20-%20Index%20Futures.md) of bonds,  offering transparency,  [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md),  and [efficient market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%2012%20Market%20Efficiency.md) access.

### 4.1. Preferred Stock Types and Features

- Fixed-rate preferred stock pays a fixed dividend rate,  while adjustable-rate preferred stock (ARPS) has a dividend rate reset based on Treasury yields.
  - Trust preferred securities are hybrid securities issued by [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md),  treated as debt for tax purposes and equity for regulatory purposes.

### 4.2. Fixed Income ETF Characteristics

- [Fixed income ETFs](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) are traded on [stock exchanges](../../Financial%20Engineering/An%20Introduction%20to%20Equity%20Markets.md),  allowing investors to buy and sell shares throughout the trading day.
  - The [arbitrage](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) mechanism ensures price alignment with [underlying securities](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Rate%20and%20Price%20Trees.md),  while [secondary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) provides substantial trading volume.

# Lecture Notes: Mortgage Loans,  Project Finance,  and Fixed Income Instruments

## 1. Introduction to Mortgage Loans

- Mortgage loans are a critical component of the [financial system](../../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md),  providing individuals with the means to purchase homes and other real estate.
  - These loans are typically structured as long-term [debt instruments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md),  with fixed or adjustable [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).
  - The [repayment schedule](../../Financial%20Engineering/Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) for a mortgage loan involves periodic payments that include both principal and interest.

### 1.1. Amortization and Loan Terms

- Amortization refers to the gradual repayment of a loan over time through regular payments.
  - A [fixed-rate mortgage](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Fixed-Rate%20Mortgage%20Loans.md) involves a consistent interest rate and monthly payment throughout the loan term.
  - The amortization schedule determines how much of each payment goes toward interest and how much toward principal.
  - In the early years of a mortgage,  payments are primarily composed of interest,  with the principal portion increasing over time.
- Exhibit 21-2 illustrates the allocation of principal and interest payments for a $100,  000 30-year fixed-rate loan with a 5.5% note rate.
  - The exhibit shows that the payment consists mostly of interest in the early period of the loan.
  - As the loan ages,  the payment is increasingly allocated to principal.
  - The crossover point,  where the [principal and interest components](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Fixed-Rate%20Mortgage%20Loans.md) of the payment are equal,  occurs in month 210.

### 1.2. Loan Types and Features

- Loans with shorter amortization schedules,  such as 15-year loans,  allow for faster equity buildup in the home.
  - Exhibit 21-3 compares the outstanding balance of a $100,  000 loan with a 5.5% note rate using 30and 15-year amortization terms.
  - The halfway mark for a 30-year loan is reached in month 246,  while it is reached in month 151 for a 20-year term and month 107 for a 15-year loan.
- Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) involve periodic interest rate adjustments based on market conditions.
  - The payment is recalculated at each reset,  using the new note rate and the remaining term of the loan.
  - Prepayments occur when a borrower refinances,  sells the property,  or defaults on the loan,  impacting the holder of the mortgage.

## 2. The Mortgage Industry

- The mortgage industry comprises various [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) involved in making mortgage loans,  either directly or indirectly.
  - Direct lenders underwrite and fund loans,  while third-party originations (TPOs) involve entities other than the seller.

## 3. Project Finance and Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)

- Project finance involves financing long-term infrastructure projects based on projected cash flows rather than the sponsors' balance sheets.
  - The [Debt Service](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) Coverage Ratio (DSCR) measures the cash available to service debt relative to [debt service](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) obligations.
  - A DSCR below unity indicates a default,  triggering remedial actions by lenders.

### 3.1. Restructurings and Embedded Options

- Restructurings in project finance may involve changes to the [capital structure](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md),  such as face value,  maturity,  or seniority.

### Example: Pooling Options for a 4.125% Conventional Loan

::: {.callout-note}

#### Example: Pooling Options for a 4.125% Conventional Loan

Consider a loan with a $4.125\%$ note rate. The optimal execution is calculated regularly by the originator and is a function of the levels of pass-through prices,  servicing valuations,  and guaranty fee buydown costs.

1. **Pass-through Prices**: The loan can be pooled into UM30 3.0% or UM30 3.5% pools,  with pass-through prices of 99.25 and 101.50,  respectively.
2. **Base Servicing**: Both options have a base [servicing fee](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%209%20-%20Mortgage-Backed%20Securities/Mortgage%20Pass-Through%20Securities.md) of 1.00,  priced at 4x.
3. **Guaranty Fee**: The guaranty fee is 0.40 for both options.
4. **Excess Servicing/G-Fee**: The excess servicing/g-fee is 0.475 for UM30 3.0% and -0.025 for UM30 3.5%.
5. **Excess/G-Fee Buydown**: The excess/g-fee buydown is 1.90 for UM30 3.0% and -0.10 for UM30 3.5%.
6. **Gross Proceeds**: The gross proceeds are 102.15 for UM30 3.0% and 102.40 for UM30 3.5%.
7. **Costs and Margin**: Both options have costs and margin of -3.00.
8. **Net Proceeds**: The net proceeds are 99.15 for UM30 3.0% and 99.40 for UM30 3.5%.

The best execution option is to securitize the loan in the 3.5% pool,  as it provides the greatest proceeds to the lender.

### Example: Calculation of Points for Different Note Rates

::: {.callout-note}

#### Example: Calculation of Points for Different Note Rates

Consider loans with note rates from $4.125\%$ to $4.5\%$,  assuming the best execution for all rates would be into pools with a $3.5\%$ coupon rate.

1. **Pass-through Price**: 101.5 for all note rates.
2. **Base Servicing**: 1 for all note rates,  assuming 4x multiple.
3. **Excess Servicing/G-Fee**: Varies by note rate,  with -0.025 for $4.125\%$,  0.100 for $4.250\%$,  0.225 for $4.375\%$,  and 0.350 for $4.500\%$.
4. **Excess Servicing Value**: Varies by note rate,  with 0.40 for $4.250\%$,  0.90 for $4.375\%$,  and 1.40 for $4.500\%$.
5. **G-fee Buydown Value**: -0.10 for $4.125\%$.
6. **Gross Proceeds**: Varies by note rate,  with 102.40 for $4.125\%$,  102.90 for $4.250\%$,  103.40 for $4.375\%$,  and 103.90 for $4.500\%$.
7. **Costs and Margin**: -3.00 for all note rates.
8. **Net Proceeds**: Varies by note rate,  with 99.40 for $4.125\%$,  99.90 for $4.250\%$,  100.40 for $4.375\%$,  and 100.90 for $4.500\%$.
9. **Points**: Varies by note rate,  with 0.60 for $4.125\%$,  0.10 for $4.250\%$,  -0.40 for $4.375\%$,  and -0.90 for $4.500\%$.
10. **Rounded Points**: Rounded to the nearest 1/8th,  with 0.50 for $4.125\%$,  0.00 for $4.250\%$,  -0.50 for $4.375\%$,  and -1.00 for $4.500\%$.

The calculation of points reflects the net value of the loan after [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) all components and its par value.

#### Example: Prepayment Risk in Mortgage Products

[Prepayment risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Risk%20Factors%20and%20Hedging%20Agency%20MBS.md) is a unique form of risk for holders of mortgage assets,  as borrowers have the option to prepay their loans before maturity.

1. **Rate-Sensitive Prepayments**: Primarily consist of refinancings for which borrowers do not monetize their homes' equity,  called rate-and-term refinancings. This activity is highly sensitive to interest and mortgage rates.
2. **Rate-Insensitive Prepayments**: Traditionally comprised of housing turnover,  including home sales and equity extraction through cash-out refinancings. Credit-related prepayments also need to be considered.
3. **Measurement of [Prepayment Rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Mortgage%20Pools.md)**: The single monthly mortality (SMM) measures monthly principal prepayments as a percentage of the balance at the beginning of the month. The conditional prepayment rate (CPR) is the SMM annualized.
4. **PSA Model**: The base PSA model assumes prepayments begin at 0.2% in the first month and increase to 6.0% CPR in month 30. Variations in prepayment speeds affect the performance of mortgages and MBS.

[Prepayment risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Risk%20Factors%20and%20Hedging%20Agency%20MBS.md) impacts the timing of investors' cash flows and creates uncertainty in [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md),  analogous to call risk for corporate and municipal bonds.

# Lecture Notes: Prepayment Risk and Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)

## 1. Introduction to Prepayment Risk

- [Prepayment risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Risk%20Factors%20and%20Hedging%20Agency%20MBS.md) is a significant concern for holders of [mortgage-backed securities](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Fremont%20Financial%20Corp.%20(b).md) (MBS) because it affects the timing and amount of cash flows received by investors.
  - Prepayments can be classified into voluntary and involuntary repayments.
  - **Voluntary Repayments**: Occur when borrowers exercise their right to prepay the loan at any time. These are primarily due to refinancing and turnover.
	- **Refinancing**: Borrowers refinance to obtain a lower interest rate or extract equity from the property.
	- **Turnover**: Involves the sale of property,  often related to relocation,  family formation,  or life events such as death or divorce.
  - **Involuntary Repayments**: Result from borrower defaults,  leading to property repossession and sale.
	- Defaults may occur due to life events (e.g.,  job loss,  illness,  family break-up) or strategic defaults when property value falls below the loan amount.
- [Prepayment risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Risk%20Factors%20and%20Hedging%20Agency%20MBS.md) can be divided into two types:
  - **Contraction Risk**: Occurs when [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) drop,  leading to accelerated prepayments and a shorter expected average life or [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the passthrough. This results in underperformance compared to noncallable bonds.
  - **Extension Risk**: Occurs when [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) rise,  extending the passthrough's average life or [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md),  causing its price to decline faster than comparable noncallable bonds. This property is referred to as [negative convexity](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Mortgage%20Pricing%20Spreads%20and%20Duration.md).

## 2. Prepayment Conventions

- Lenders are considered "short" the prepayment option to the borrower,  as borrowers can terminate loans at any time.
  - Residential real estate loans typically do not carry prepayment penalties,  exposing them to considerable [prepayment risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Risk%20Factors%20and%20Hedging%20Agency%20MBS.md) from voluntary repayments.

### 2.1. Single Monthly Mortality Rate and Conditional Prepayment Rate

- The **Single Monthly Mortality Rate (SMM)** measures the percentage of a pool's principal balance that has prepaid in the current month.
  - Formula: $$\text{SMM} = \frac{\text{Scheduled balance} - \text{Ending balance}}{\text{Scheduled balance}} \times 100$$
  - Alternative Formula: $$\text{SMM} = \frac{\text{Beginning balance} - \text{Scheduled principal} - \text{Ending balance}}{\text{Beginning balance} - \text{Scheduled principal}} \times 100$$
- The **Conditional Prepayment Rate (CPR)** is the annualized measure of the SMM.
  - Formula: $$\text{CPR} = 1 - (1 - \text{SMM})^{12} \times 100$$

### 2.2. Public Securities Association Model

- The **Public Securities Association (PSA) model** describes [mortgage prepayments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Prepayment%20Modeling.md) as a function of loan age (seasoning).
  - Begins at 0.2% CPR in the first month,  increases by 0.2% CPR per month,  and reaches a maximum of 6.0% CPR in month 30.
  - Variations include 150 PSA (multiplies the model by 150%) and 50 PSA (multiplies the model by 50%).

## 3. Modeling MBS Cash Flows

- Cash-flow modeling is essential for valuing agency passthroughs,  defining the timing of principal return and interest payment to investors.
  - Complications arise from servicing fees,  guarantee fees (GFee),  and private mortgage insurance (PMI),  which are subtracted from the borrower's note rate to determine the net note rate or net weighted average coupon (NWac).

### 3.1. Cash-Flow Analysis

- The cash-flow profile of an MBS pool is influenced by prepayment assumptions.
  - Without prepayments,  investors receive level cash flows over the pool's life.
  - With prepayments,  cash flows become front-loaded,  altering the share of principal and interest paid to investors.

### 3.2. Applying Prepayment Assumptions

- Prepayment assumptions are critical for deriving [MBS cash flows](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Mortgage%20Pricing%20Spreads%20and%20Duration.md).
  - The foundation is the SMM,  with the CPR as the annualized measure.
  - Prepaid principal is calculated after accounting for scheduled principal payments.

## 4. Determinants of Prepayment Rates

- Prepayments are the chief determinant of a passthrough's [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) performance,  influenced by refinancing,  turnover,  seasoning,  and default.

### 4.1. Refinancing

- Homeowners refinance to lower monthly payments,  alter mortgage terms,  or extract equity.
  - Refinancing is highly interest rate-sensitive,  with lower transaction costs and improved originator efficiency increasing the refinancing response.

### 4.2. Turnover

- Turnover refers to prepayments due to property sales,  influenced by [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md),  household income,  and housing prices.
  - Seasonality affects turnover,  with peak home sales in summer and troughs in winter.

### 4.3. Seasoning

- Seasoning refers to the loan's age,  with pools classified as new,  moderate,  or seasoned.
  - Burnout occurs as borrowers who can refinance do so,  leaving fewer responsive borrowers in the pool.

### 4.4. Defaults

- Defaults result in prepayments when servicers foreclose and sell properties.
  - Agency passthroughs protect investors from foreclosure losses through guarantees.

## 5. Prepayment Modeling

- Prepayment modeling is essential for valuing agency mortgage passthroughs and derivative RMBS.
  - Models estimate both voluntary and involuntary repayments,  incorporating fundamental drivers of [mortgage prepayments](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Prepayment%20Modeling.md).

## 6. MBS Analytics

- Key analytics for MBS include cash-flow yield,  average life,  and [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md).

### 6.1. Cash-Flow Yield

- The cash-flow yield is the interest rate that equates the present value of monthly cash flows to the market price.
  - It is annualized to compare with Treasury or corporate bond yields,  using the bond-equivalent yield.

### 6.2. Weighted Average Life

- The weighted average life is the average time to receipt of principal payments,  influenced by the PSA prepayment assumption.
  - It shortens with accelerated principal return,  requiring qualification with a prepayment assumption.

### 6.3. Duration

- [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) measures a bond's sensitivity to [interest rate changes](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke-Chapter%2012%20to%20Chapter%2014.md),  calculated using price changes for yield increases and decreases.

## Summary

- [Prepayment risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Risk%20Factors%20and%20Hedging%20Agency%20MBS.md) significantly impacts MBS [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) performance,  with voluntary and involuntary repayments affecting cash flows.
- Understanding prepayment conventions,  modeling,  and analytics is crucial for valuing MBS and managing [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) risk.
- The PSA model and prepayment assumptions play key roles in cash-flow analysis and determining MBS yields and durations.

# Lecture Notes: Duration Measures,  Agency Passthrough Market,  and Collateralized Mortgage Obligations

## 1. Introduction to Duration Measures

- [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) is a measure of a bond's sensitivity to changes in [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md),  providing an estimate of the percentage price change for a given change in yield.
  - [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) measures fall into two categories: model [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) and empirical [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md).

### 1.1. Model Duration

- **Model [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)**: Uses analytical models to obtain the two prices in the numerator of the [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) formula.
  - **[Modified Duration](../../Financial%20Engineering/A%20Guide%20to%20Duration%20DV01%20and%20Yield%20Curve.md)**: Assumes cash flows do not change with [interest rate changes](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke-Chapter%2012%20to%20Chapter%2014.md),  making it the simplest but least reliable measure for prepayment-sensitive securities.
  - **Cash-Flow [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)**: Assumes prepayments change with [interest rate changes](../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke-Chapter%2012%20to%20Chapter%2014.md),  resulting in a new [cash flow](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) based on projected prepayment speeds.
  - **Effective [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)**: Uses a valuation model to determine prices,  considering embedded options and interest rate path dependency.

### 1.2. Market-Based Duration

- **Market-Based [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)**: Uses observed market prices rather than projected prices.
  - **Empirical [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)**: Estimated from historical prices and yields using regression analysis.
  - **[Hedging](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)**: Accounts for factors like interest rate levels,  yield curve shape,  and expected volatility.
  - **Coupon Curve [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)**: Uses market prices to estimate [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) by rolling up and down the coupon curve.

## 2. Anatomy of the Agency Passthrough Market

- The agency passthrough market is driven by [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) and expected prepayment behavior.
  - [Liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) is maximized in trading generic agency passthroughs,  while prepayment behavior is parsed in [specified pools](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md) and small pooling programs.

### 2.1. Generic Securities

- The TBA ([To Be Announced](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md)) market allows forward trading of agency passthroughs based on generic attributes of coupon and term.
  - The [TBA market](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md) is one of the world's most liquid markets,  second only to the U.S. Treasury market.
  - The [introduction](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Introduction.md) of the Uniform Mortgage Backed Security (UMBS) enhanced [TBA market](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md) [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md).

### 2.2. Coupon Stacks

- Within programs,  pools are aggregated by coupon,  with whole and half coupons simplifying analysis and maximizing [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md).
  - TBA securities or coupons are the whole and half coupons of the mainstay 30and 15-year programs.

### 2.3. Dollar Roll Financing

- The dollar roll is a financing mechanism allowing 100% [collateralized borrowing](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20Part%202%20Repos.md) against a pool of [agency MBS](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/The%20Mortgage%20Market%20in%20the%20United%20States.md).
  - It evolved to meet the needs of dealers and originators for [hedging](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) and covering short positions.

### 2.4. Specified Trades

- [Specified pools](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md) exhibit superior or inferior [convexity](../Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) relative to generic pools,  trading at a premium or concession.
  - Pools are identified by prefix,  geography,  loan balance,  investor percentage,  refinance,  and loan-to-value ratio.

## 3. Agency Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs)

- CMOs allow investors to control when they receive principal from [mortgage-backed securities](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Fremont%20Financial%20Corp.%20(b).md) by dividing principal into tranches.
  - The CMO market has grown significantly,  offering a variety of tranche types and structures.

### 3.1. CMO Tranche Types

- **Planned Amortization Class (PAC)**: Offers stable,  prescheduled cash flows,  with non-PAC tranches having variable cash flows.
- **Sequential**: Tranches receive principal in order,  with lockout periods before receiving principal.

### 3.2. Liquidity and Market Dynamics

- The CMO market is large but lacks homogeneity,  affecting [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md).
  - CMOs are typically less liquid than agency passthroughs but comparable to [Corporate Bonds](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Notes%202%20–%20Corporate%20Bond%20Contracts.md).

### 3.3. Practical Details

- CMOs settle in book entry via DTC,  with [primary market](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) CMOs having delayed settlement.
  - Monthly [interest and principal](../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) payments are similar to [pass-throughs](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%209%20-%20Mortgage-Backed%20Securities/Mortgage%20Pass-Through%20Securities.md),  with delay days impacting yield.

# Lecture Notes: Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs) and Prepayment Risk

## 1. Introduction to Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs)

- [Collateralized Mortgage Obligations](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Other%20MBS.md) (CMOs) are a type of mortgage-backed security that divides the principal and interest payments from a pool of mortgages into different classes or tranches.
  - Each tranche has its own maturity and risk profile,  allowing investors to choose the tranche that best fits their [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) needs.
  - CMOs are designed to provide more predictable cash flows compared to traditional [mortgage-backed securities](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Fremont%20Financial%20Corp.%20(b).md).

### 1.1. Tranche Coupon vs. Collateral Coupon

- In the CMO world,  the tranche coupon refers to the interest rate paid to investors in a specific tranche,  while the collateral coupon refers to the interest rate of the underlying [mortgage pool](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Mortgage%20Pools.md).
  - For example,  a 5.0/5.5 sequential CMO would have a 5% coupon for the tranche and a 5.5% coupon for the underlying pass-through collateral.

### 1.2. Yield Tables and Market Performance

- Exhibit 23-2 compares the yield tables of a full coupon 5.5/5.5 sequential with a stripped-down 4.0/5.5 sequential.
  - The principal cash flows for both bonds react similarly to changes in [prepayment rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Mortgage%20Pools.md).
  - However,  market performance differs due to the longer [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the 4.0/5.5 tranche.

- The 4.0/5.5 tranche has a 5.26 option-adjusted [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) (OAD) versus a 3.11 OAD for the 5.5/5.5 full coupon sequential.
- When interest-only (IO) is removed from a tranche,  the negative [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) associated with the IO is also removed,  extending the [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the remaining bond.

## 2. Analysis of Sequential CMOs

- Analysis of sequentials falls into two broad categories:
  - **Short [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) Sequentials**: Typically compared to short agencies,  ABS hybrid ARMs,  and other CMOs. Investors focus on yield and extension risk.
  - **Longer [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) Sequentials**: Compared with the underlying collateral using OAS or yield analysis. Total rate of return analysis may be used to compare expected [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) under different interest rate scenarios.

## 3. Planned Amortization Class (PAC) CMOs

- PACs are one of the most stable classes of CMOs,  given a pre-set schedule for principal paydown.
  - If prepayment speeds remain within a specific band (the PAC band),  the PAC adheres to its original schedule,  behaving like a corporate bond with a pro rata sinking fund structure.

### 3.1. PAC Bands and Broken PACs

- PAC bands are expressed in PSA terms,  with prepayments expected to remain constant within the band.
  - Over time,  especially in fast prepayment environments,  PAC bands can drift,  generally growing tighter.
  - When support bonds are paid off,  PACs behave like sequential bonds and are termed broken PACs.

#### Exhibit 23-4: Example of a New PAC,  Original PAC Band 100-250 PSA

| Scenario | -200 | -100 | 0 | 100 | 200 |
|----------|------|------|---|-----|-----|
| Prepayment (PSA) | 1,    665 | 800 | 220 | 143 | 120 |
| Price | | | | | |
| 101.1875 | 3.99% | 4.39% | 4.75% | 4.75% | 4.75% |
| 102.1875 | 3.30% | 3.96% | 4.56% | 4.56% | 4.56% |
| 103.1875 | 2.62% | 3.54% | 4.37% | 4.37% | 4.37% |
| Average Life | 1.50 | 2.47 | 5.95 | 5.95 | 5.95 |
| OAS | 41 | | | | |
| OAD | 3.65 | | | | |
| OAC | -1.26 | | | | |
| Vol [Duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) | 0.05 | | | | |

- As [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) rise,  the average life of a PAC stays around 5.95 years.
- Very fast prepayment speeds can cause the PAC to break out of its band,  shortening its [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) significantly.

## Summary

- CMOs offer investors control over cash flows,  with various tranche types and structures catering to different [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) needs.
- Understanding the mechanics,  risks,  and market dynamics of CMOs is crucial for informed [investment decision](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%201%20Introduction%20to%20Securities%20Trading%20and%20Markets.md)-making.
- [Prepayment risk](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Risk%20Factors%20and%20Hedging%20Agency%20MBS.md) significantly impacts CMO [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) performance,  with voluntary and involuntary repayments affecting cash flows.
- PACs provide stability but can become broken PACs in fast prepayment environments,  affecting their market performance.
