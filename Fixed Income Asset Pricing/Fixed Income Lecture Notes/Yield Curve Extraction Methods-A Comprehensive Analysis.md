## Step 1: Provide an overview of the yield curve extraction methods
The problem discusses three methods for extracting the yield curve from market data: Bootstrapping, Nelson-Siegel interpolation, and Cash Flow Matrices.

## Step 2: Describe the strengths and weaknesses of each method
Bootstrapping provides an exact fit to observed prices but can be sensitive to pricing errors. Nelson-Siegel offers a smooth, parsimonious representation that captures the general shape of the yield curve but may not fit all observed prices perfectly. Cash Flow Matrices provides a balance between fitting observed prices and producing a smooth curve.

## Step 3: Discuss the choice of method depending on application
The choice of method depends on the specific application and characteristics of available data. For general yield curve estimation and forecasting, Nelson-Siegel is often preferred due to its smoothness and parsimony. For pricing and risk management applications that require a closer fit to market prices, Bootstrapping or Cash Flow Matrices methods may be more appropriate.

## Step 4: Provide references for the methods discussed
The problem references three key papers on yield curve estimation: Nelson and Siegel (1987), Fama and Bliss (1987), and Svensson (1994).

## Step 5: Summarize the findings in a concise manner
This problem provides an overview of three yield curve extraction methods, their strengths and weaknesses, and discusses the choice of method depending on application. It also references key papers on the topic.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$
