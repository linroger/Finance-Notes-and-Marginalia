### Question 1: True/False Questions
#### (1.A) Duration of Floating Rate Notes
**True**. As discussed in class, floating rate notes reset to par at every coupon date.

#### (1.B) Spot and Forward Rates Relationship

**False**. While designed to have zero value at inception, the swap's value changes over time as interest rates fluctuate.

#### (1.D) Risk-Neutral Probabilities
**False**. Risk-neutral probabilities are a pricing methodology that embeds risk premiums, not an indication of actual risk neutrality.
