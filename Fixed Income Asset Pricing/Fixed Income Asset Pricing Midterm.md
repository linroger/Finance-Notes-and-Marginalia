# Fixed Income Asset Pricing Midterm Solutions

## INSTRUCTIONS
- This is a comprehensive solution to the Fixed Income Asset Pricing midterm.
- Solutions cover three primary questions addressing various aspects of fixed income markets.
- Answers are detailed and include mathematical derivations and economic intuition.

## Problem Breakdown
### Question 1: True/False Questions
#### (1.A) Duration of Floating Rate Notes
**True**. As discussed in class, floating rate notes reset to par at every coupon date.

#### (1.B) Spot and Forward Rates Relationship
**True**. The forward rate is a function of the slope of the term structure.

#### (1.C) Swap Value at Inception
**False**. While designed to have zero value at inception, the swap's value changes over time as interest rates fluctuate.

#### (1.D) Risk-Neutral Probabilities
**False**. Risk-neutral probabilities are a pricing methodology that embeds risk premiums, not an indication of actual risk neutrality.

#### (1.E) Real Yield Calculation
**False**. The real yield involves more than simple subtraction of expected inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) from nominal yield.
