# Fixed Income Asset Pricing Midterm Solutions

## INSTRUCTIONS
- This is a comprehensive solution to the [Fixed Income Asset Pricing](Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing.md) midterm.
- Solutions cover three primary questions addressing various aspects of [fixed income markets](../Financial%20Engineering/A%20Practical%20Guide%20to%20Bonds%20and%20Swaps.md).
- Answers are detailed and include mathematical derivations and economic intuition.

## Problem Breakdown
### Question 1: True/False Questions
#### (1.A) Duration of Floating Rate Notes
**True**. As discussed in class, [floating rate notes](.md) reset to par at every coupon date.

#### (1.B) Spot and Forward Rates Relationship
**True**. The [forward rate](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) is a function of the slope of the [term structure](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md).

#### (1.C) Swap Value at Inception
**False**. While designed to have zero value at inception, the swap's value changes over time as [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) fluctuate.

#### (1.D) Risk-Neutral Probabilities
**False**. [Risk-neutral probabilities](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments.md) are a [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) methodology that embeds risk premiums, not an indication of actual [risk neutrality](../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md).

#### (1.E) Real Yield Calculation
**False**. The real yield involves more than simple subtraction of expected [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918â€“1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) from nominal yield.
