Definition

A [[Currency Swap Basics|cross-currency swap]] is a financial contract where two entities exchange an equivalent amount of principal in different currencies. Then each entity makes interest payments on the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] they received, with rates that can be fixed or floating.

Let's say a German company needs to borrow U.S. dollars to pay for building a factory in the U.S. It could go to an American bank and get one, of course. But it would have to pay a much higher interest rate than it could get at home, and would face the risk that the euro will [depreciate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp) against the dollar, making it more difficult to repay the loan.

The [[Currency Swap Basics|cross-currency swap]] offers an alternative. The German company would find an American company looking to borrow in euros. The two companies would both borrow an agreed-upon amount in their home country, where they could get better loan terms, and then simply exchange the principal amounts and make interest payments in the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] they received.

In short, they would swap [principal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp) and interest payments in one [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] for principal and interest payments in another.

## How Does a Cross-Currency Swap Work?

To start, the parties need to agree on the terms of the swap. Companies can customize the terms of the contract based on market conditions and their views of future market conditions. For example, if a company believes [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] are likely to fall in the borrowing country, from which they will receive the funding, they can ask their counterparty for a [floating rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatinginterestrate.asp).

Some of the points that need to be worked out include:

- The principal amounts in each [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]
- The exchange rate to be used in the swap
- The type of [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] (fixed for fixed; fixed for floating; or floating for floating)
- The payment schedule
- The contract's maturity date

The actual swap begins with an initial exchange of principal at the pre-agreed exchange rate. At the contract's end, the principal is swapped back at the same exchange rate, eliminating [foreign exchange risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreignexchangerisk.asp).

[[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]]-swap contracts are traded over the counter. It's generally quite difficult for a company to find a counterparty whose needs match its own, so in most cases, parties work with intermediary [swap banks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swapbank.asp) that facilitate the exchange for a fee.

## How Are Cross-Currency Swaps Used?

Cross-[[Financial Instruments PSET Solutions|currency swaps]] have many uses. They include:

- **[[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|Hedging]] foreign-exchange risk**: Companies use cross-[[Financial Instruments PSET Solutions|currency swaps]] to protect against foreign-exchange rate fluctuations by converting liabilities or revenues into a preferred [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] at a fixed rate.
- **Aligning debt with revenue [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]**: Companies operating internationally often [[Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio|generate revenue]] in multiple currencies but may not have access to [debt markets](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071415/what-are-differences-between-debt-and-equity-markets.asp) in each [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]. A [[Currency Swap Basics|cross-currency swap]] can give them access.
- **Reducing [[Notes on Currency Swaps|borrowing costs]]**: Some markets charge foreign companies higher [[Notes on Currency Swaps|borrowing costs]]. With a [[Currency Swap Basics|cross-currency swap]], companies can borrow on better terms in their home market and use the swap to meet their needs in the foreign market.
- **Facilitating foreign investments**: A [[Currency Swap Basics|cross-currency swap]] enables companies to secure funding in their home market to invest in international assets, even when the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] requires payment in the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] of the target's home country.
- **Optimizing [[Preview of the Book|cash flow]]**: Multinational corporations use swaps to convert revenue streams into their reporting [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]], stabilizing [[[Preview of the Book|cash flow]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp) and reducing the impact of exchange rate volatility.

### Advantages of Cross-Currency Swaps

Cross-[[Financial Instruments PSET Solutions|currency swaps]] have the following advantages:

**[[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|Hedging]] foreign exchange risk**: These [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] help companies manage [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] risk by locking in exchange rates for future transactions (if they choose a [fixed rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedinterestrate.asp)). This provides stability in financial planning and reduces uncertainty in [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] movements.

**Lower [[Notes on Currency Swaps|borrowing costs]]**: Some companies can reduce borrowing expenses by issuing debt in their home country where they have better credit conditions. Also, some can attain lower rates by swapping their debt into a foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] if benchmark rates are lower in that country.

**Access to global capital markets**: Businesses can issue debt in foreign markets with better financing terms and then use a swap to convert the proceeds into their local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]. This enables firms to take advantage of deeper [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] and lower [[Notes on Currency Swaps|borrowing costs]] while still servicing their debt in their functional [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].

**Flexibility in interest rate structures**: Cross-[[Financial Instruments PSET Solutions|currency swaps]] enable firms to choose between fixed or floating [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]], depending on their strategy and [[Forward Rate|market expectations]]. This enables companies to adjust [[Duration Gap Management|interest rate exposure]] and optimize financing costs.

**[[Preview of the Book|Cash flow]] matching:** Multinational corporations can use swaps to align revenue and debt payments in the same [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]. This reduces [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] mismatch risk, stabilizes cash flows, and ensures smoother financial operations.

### Disadvantages of Cross-Currency Swaps

Conversely, cross-[[Financial Instruments PSET Solutions|currency swaps]] have several disadvantages:

**Counterparty risk**: If one party fails to meet its obligations, the other is exposed to potential financial losses. This risk is particularly concerning for long-term swaps, as a counterparty's creditworthiness may deteriorate over time.

**[[Analysis of Fixed Income Securities|Interest rate risk]]**: Companies that choose floating [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] are exposed to rising benchmark rates, which can increase debt payments.

**[[Lessons From The Crisis|Basis risk]]**: Mismatches between interest rate benchmarks can create unexpected cost variations. This risk can lead to additional financial exposure and complexity in managing [[Fundamentals of Swaps|swap agreements]].

**[[Asset Backed Commercial Paper Understanding the Risks|Liquidity risk]]**: Cross-[[Financial Instruments PSET Solutions|currency swaps]] are traded over the counter. This means exiting the swap before it matures could be difficult and costly because finding a counterparty is often challenging.

**Mark-to-[[Class Slides On Terrausd Runs 2|market volatility]]**: The fair value of a [[Currency Swap Basics|cross-currency swap]] fluctuates with market conditions, affecting a company's financial statements. This can lead to earnings volatility.

**Complex structuring and high transaction costs**: Structuring a [[Currency Swap Basics|cross-currency swap]] requires specialized financial expertise and often involves significant legal, accounting, and administrative expenses. These costs can make swaps less attractive for smaller firms or those with limited financial resources.

## Example of a Cross-Currency Swap

A U.S.-based multinational corporation, Company A, is expanding operations in Germany. It needs 100 million euros for [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] but prefers to keep its liabilities in U.S. dollars to avoid [[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyrisk.asp). [[Interest Rate Quotations|Interest rates]] in Europe, based on the [Euro Interbank Offered Rate ([[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|EURIBOR]])](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|euribor]].asp), are lower than in the U.S., making borrowing in euros cheaper.

**Step 1: Exchange of Principal**

Firstly, instead of a direct euro loan, Company A borrows $100 million in the U.S. bond market at the [[[SOFR|Secured Overnight Financing Rate]] (SOFR)](https://www.investopedia.com/secured-overnight-financing-rate-sofr-4683954) + 1%.

Next, the company enters into a [[Currency Swap Basics|cross-currency swap]] over five years with a European bank, Bank B. The swap details are as follows:

- Company A receives 100 million euros from Bank B.
- Company A gives $110 million to Bank B.
- The exchange rate is locked at 1.10 EUR/USD.

**Step 2: Swap Interest Payments**

Over the five years, Company A and Bank B pay each other interest.

Effectively, company A converts its dollar debt into euro debt, ensuring its liabilities match its euro revenues from German operations.

**Step 3: The Swap Matures**

At the end of the five-year contract, the principal amounts are exchanged again at the original agreed rate. Company A [[Assets|returns]] 100 million euros to Bank B, and Bank B [[Assets|returns]] $110 million to Company A.

## The Bottom Line

Cross-[[Financial Instruments PSET Solutions|currency swaps]] are a valuable tool for managing foreign exchange risk, lowering [[Notes on Currency Swaps|borrowing costs]], and accessing global [capital markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalmarkets.asp). By allowing parties to exchange principal and interest payments in different currencies while locking exchange rates, they help mitigate foreign-exchange exposure and capitalize on [[What Really Is the Cross-Currency Basis|interest rate differentials]].

However, they come with risks that must be carefully managed, including counterparty default, [[Fixed Income Versus Equity Derivatives|interest rate volatility]], and [[[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]].asp) challenges. When used strategically, cross-[[Financial Instruments PSET Solutions|currency swaps]] can provide financial flexibility and cost savings.
