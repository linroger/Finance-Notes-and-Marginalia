## What Is a Cash-and-Carry Trade?

A [[Carry Trade|cash-and-carry]] trade is an [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]] strategy that exploits the mispricing between an asset and its corresponding derivative. The key to profiting from this strategy is the eventual correction of that mispricing.

A [[Carry Trade|cash-and-carry]] trade should not be confused with a [[[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencycarrytrade.asp) in the context of forex trading, which looks for [[What Really Is the Cross-Currency Basis|interest rate differentials]] between countries.

### Key Takeaways

- A [[Carry Trade|cash-and-carry]] trade is an [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]] strategy that profits off the mispricing between the [[Risk Neutral Pricing of Options|underlying asset]] and its corresponding derivative.
- A [[Carry Trade|cash-and-carry]] trade is usually executed by entering a [[Chapter 4 - Futures: Hedging and Speculation|long position]] in an asset while simultaneously selling the associated derivative.
- Specifically, this is done by [[Short Selling|going short]] the market via a [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] or options contract.

## Understanding Cash-and-Carry Trades

A [[Carry Trade|cash-and-carry]] trade takes advantage of market [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] discrepancies. It usually entails taking a [[[Chapter 4 - Futures: Hedging and Speculation|long position]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) in a security or commodity while simultaneously selling the associated derivative, specifically by [[[Short Selling|shorting]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) a [[[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp) or [options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) contract.

The security or commodity being purchased is held until the contract [delivery date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deliverydate.asp) and is used to cover the short position’s obligation. By selling a [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] contract, the investor has taken a short position. The investor knows how much will be made on the delivery date and the cost of the security because of the [[Carry Trade|cash-and-carry]] trade’s [[Chapter 4 - Futures: Hedging and Speculation|long position]] component.

For example, in the case of a [bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp), the investor receives the [[Realized Returns|coupon payments]] from the bond they've bought, plus any [[[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentincome.asp) earned by investing the coupons, as well as the predetermined future price at the future delivery date.

## Steps in a Cash-and-Carry Trade

There are three main steps in a [[Carry Trade|cash-and-carry]] trade:

- An investor identifies two securities that are currently mispriced with respect to each other, such as the spot crude price and crude [[Futures Price and the Quality Option Before E|futures price]]. This presents an [[[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/[[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]].asp) opportunity.
- The investor must first purchase spot crude and sell a crude [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] contract.
- Then, the investor must hold (or "carry") spot crude until the crude [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] contract expires, at which time the investor delivers the spot crude.

Regardless of what the delivery price is, a profit is only assured if the purchase price of spot crude *plus* the [cost of carry](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcarry.asp) is less than the price at which the crude [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] contract was initially sold.

### Cash-and-Carry Trades in the Credit Derivatives Market

This strategy is commonly known as [basis trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basis-trading.asp), Often, carry trades are executed to take advantage of the implied [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] generated from the positions because they may end up being more favorable than borrowing or lending through traditional channels.

This strategy also has an application in the [[[RISK NEUTRAL VALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS|credit derivatives]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditderivative.asp) market, where basis (the difference between a commodity's immediate cash price and its [[Futures Price and the Quality Option Before E|futures price]]) represents the difference in spread between [credit default swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp) (CDS) and bonds for the same debt issuer (and with similar—if not exactly equal—maturities).

Here, the strategy is called a [[Cds-Bond Basis|negative basis trade]]. (In the [[RISK NEUTRAL VALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS|credit derivatives]] market, basis can be positive or negative; [a negative basis](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/negative-basis-trades.asp) means that the [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]] is smaller than the bond spread.)

The trade is usually done with bonds that are trading at [par](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp) or at a [discount](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discount.asp), and a [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|single-name CDS]] (as opposed to an [index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp) CDS) of a [tenor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tenor.asp) equal to the maturity of the bond.

### Cash-and-Carry Trades in the Options Market

In the options market, an example of a [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]] is a [box spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boxspread.asp).

Box spreads are used for borrowing or lending at implied rates that are more favorable than a trader going to their prime broker, clearing firm, or bank. Because the price of a box at its expiration will always be the distance between the strikes involved (e.g., a 100-pt box might utilize the 25 and 125 strikes and would be worth $100 at expiration), the price paid for today can be thought of as that of a [zero-coupon bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp).

The lower the initial cost of the box, the higher its implied interest rate.

This concept is known as a synthetic loan. Thus, the difference in the price of the box spread from the difference between the strike prices is the carry.

For instance, if a trader executes a [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]] using a box spread in the S&P 500 using the 1,000 and 2,000 strikes, the spread will be worth $1,000 at expiration (i.e., the distance between strikes). If the spread costs $1,050 in the market, that $50 represents the implied interest rate associated with the cost of carry.

## Example of a Cash-and-Carry Trade

Assume an asset currently trades at $100 while the one-month futures contract is priced at $104. In addition, monthly [carrying costs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carrying-costs.asp)—such as storage, insurance, and financing—for this asset is equal to $2. In this case, the trader would buy the asset (open a long position) at $100, and simultaneously sell the one-month [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] contract (initiate a short position) at $104.

The cost to buy and hold the asset is $102, but the investor has already locked in a sale at $104. The trader would then carry the asset until the [[Risk Neutral Pricing of Options|expiration date]] of the [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] contract and deliver it against the contract, thereby ensuring an [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]] profit of $2.

## What Is Arbitrage?

[[[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|Arbitrage]] is](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-is-[[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]]/#:~:text=[[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|Arbitrage]]%20occurs%20when%20a%20security,lets%20traders%20lock%20in%20profits.) simultaneously buying and selling the same asset in different markets or in derivative forms to profit from the brief differences in their prices.

[[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|Arbitrage]] is used in the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] and [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|commodities]] markets as well as in international stock markets.

## Is a Cash-and-Carry Trade the Same As an Arbitrage Trade?

A [[Carry Trade|cash-and-carry]] trade is one type of [[PSET 1 Solution-Financial Instruments|arbitrage trade]]. In this case, the trader exploits the difference in [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] between an asset and a derivative that is based on that asset. The trader simultaneously buys one and sells the other, profiting from the brief difference in price.

## Is Cash-and-Carry Legal in the U.S.?

The [[Carry Trade|cash-and-carry]] trade is legal in the U.S., as is [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]] trading in general. In fact, the practice is [positively encouraged](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/032615/why-[[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]]-trading-legal.asp#:~:text=[[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|Arbitrage]]%20trading%20is%20not%20only,providing%20liquidity%20in%20different%20markets.) as a means of increasing [[Chapter 12 Market Efficiency|market efficiency]] and providing [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] in the markets.

## The Bottom Line

The [[Carry Trade|cash-and-carry]] trade is one variety of [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]], the practice of buying and selling the same asset in two markets in order to profit from the brief discrepancies in their prices.

The practice of [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]] is perhaps best known in the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] markets, where miniscule differences in posted prices encourage such a strategy.

[[Carry Trade|Cash-and-carry]], though, relies on a different set of assets: one the "real" asset and a second a derivative based on that asset's price.
