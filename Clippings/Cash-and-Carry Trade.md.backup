## What Is a Cash-and-Carry Trade?

A [cash-and-carry](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md) trade is an [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) strategy that exploits the mispricing between an asset and its corresponding derivative. The key to profiting from this strategy is the eventual correction of that mispricing.

A [cash-and-carry](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md) trade should not be confused with a [carry trade]([Currency%20Carry%20Trade)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencycarrytrade.asp) in the context of forex trading, which looks for [interest rate differentials](../Financial%20Markets/Random%20Walks%20in%20Fixed%20Income%20and%20Foreign%20Exchange/Chapter%201/What%20Really%20Is%20the%20Cross-Currency%20Basis.md) between countries.

### Key Takeaways

- A [cash-and-carry](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md) trade is an [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) strategy that profits off the mispricing between the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) and its corresponding derivative.
- A [cash-and-carry](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md) trade is usually executed by entering a [long position](../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%204%20-%20Futures:%20Hedging%20and%20Speculation.md) in an asset while simultaneously selling the associated derivative.
- Specifically, this is done by [going short](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Short%20Selling.md) the market via a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) or options contract.

## Understanding Cash-and-Carry Trades

A [cash-and-carry](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md) trade takes advantage of market [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) discrepancies. It usually entails taking a [long position]([Chapter%204%20-%20Futures:%20Hedging%20and%20Speculation)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) in a security or commodity while simultaneously selling the associated derivative, specifically by [shorting]([Short%20Selling)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) a [futures]([Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp) or [options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) contract.

The security or commodity being purchased is held until the contract [delivery date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deliverydate.asp) and is used to cover the short position’s obligation. By selling a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract, the investor has taken a short position. The investor knows how much will be made on the delivery date and the cost of the security because of the [cash-and-carry](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md) trade’s [long position](../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%204%20-%20Futures:%20Hedging%20and%20Speculation.md) component.

For example, in the case of a [bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp), the investor receives the [coupon payments](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) from the bond they've bought, plus any [investment]([An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer) income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentincome.asp) earned by investing the coupons, as well as the predetermined future price at the future delivery date.

## Steps in a Cash-and-Carry Trade

There are three main steps in a [cash-and-carry](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md) trade:

- An investor identifies two securities that are currently mispriced with respect to each other, such as the spot crude price and crude [futures price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md). This presents an [arbitrage]([Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/[arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md).asp) opportunity.
- The investor must first purchase spot crude and sell a crude [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract.
- Then, the investor must hold (or "carry") spot crude until the crude [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract expires, at which time the investor delivers the spot crude.

Regardless of what the delivery price is, a profit is only assured if the purchase price of spot crude *plus* the [cost of carry](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcarry.asp) is less than the price at which the crude [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract was initially sold.

### Cash-and-Carry Trades in the Credit Derivatives Market

This strategy is commonly known as [basis trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basis-trading.asp), Often, carry trades are executed to take advantage of the implied [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) generated from the positions because they may end up being more favorable than borrowing or lending through traditional channels.

This strategy also has an application in the [credit derivatives]([RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditderivative.asp) market, where basis (the difference between a commodity's immediate cash price and its [futures price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md)) represents the difference in spread between [credit default swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp) (CDS) and bonds for the same debt issuer (and with similar—if not exactly equal—maturities).

Here, the strategy is called a [negative basis trade](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Bond%20Basis.md). (In the [credit derivatives](../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) market, basis can be positive or negative; [a negative basis](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/negative-basis-trades.asp) means that the [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) is smaller than the bond spread.)

The trade is usually done with bonds that are trading at [par](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp) or at a [discount](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discount.asp), and a [single-name CDS](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) (as opposed to an [index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp) CDS) of a [tenor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tenor.asp) equal to the maturity of the bond.

### Cash-and-Carry Trades in the Options Market

In the options market, an example of a [carry trade](Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) is a [box spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boxspread.asp).

Box spreads are used for borrowing or lending at implied rates that are more favorable than a trader going to their prime broker, clearing firm, or bank. Because the price of a box at its expiration will always be the distance between the strikes involved (e.g., a 100-pt box might utilize the 25 and 125 strikes and would be worth $100 at expiration), the price paid for today can be thought of as that of a [zero-coupon bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp).

The lower the initial cost of the box, the higher its implied interest rate.

This concept is known as a synthetic loan. Thus, the difference in the price of the box spread from the difference between the strike prices is the carry.

For instance, if a trader executes a [carry trade](Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) using a box spread in the S&P 500 using the 1,000 and 2,000 strikes, the spread will be worth $1,000 at expiration (i.e., the distance between strikes). If the spread costs $1,050 in the market, that $50 represents the implied interest rate associated with the cost of carry.

## Example of a Cash-and-Carry Trade

Assume an asset currently trades at $100 while the one-month futures contract is priced at $104. In addition, monthly [carrying costs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carrying-costs.asp)—such as storage, insurance, and financing—for this asset is equal to $2. In this case, the trader would buy the asset (open a long position) at $100, and simultaneously sell the one-month [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract (initiate a short position) at $104.

The cost to buy and hold the asset is $102, but the investor has already locked in a sale at $104. The trader would then carry the asset until the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) of the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract and deliver it against the contract, thereby ensuring an [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) profit of $2.

## What Is Arbitrage?

[Arbitrage]([Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives) is](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-is-[arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md)/#:~:text=[Arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md)%20occurs%20when%20a%20security,lets%20traders%20lock%20in%20profits.) simultaneously buying and selling the same asset in different markets or in derivative forms to profit from the brief differences in their prices.

[Arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) is used in the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) and [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) markets as well as in international stock markets.

## Is a Cash-and-Carry Trade the Same As an Arbitrage Trade?

A [cash-and-carry](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md) trade is one type of [arbitrage trade](../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/Solutions/PSET%201%20Solution-Financial%20Instruments.md). In this case, the trader exploits the difference in [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) between an asset and a derivative that is based on that asset. The trader simultaneously buys one and sells the other, profiting from the brief difference in price.

## Is Cash-and-Carry Legal in the U.S.?

The [cash-and-carry](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md) trade is legal in the U.S., as is [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) trading in general. In fact, the practice is [positively encouraged](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/032615/why-[arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md)-trading-legal.asp#:~:text=[Arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md)%20trading%20is%20not%20only,providing%20liquidity%20in%20different%20markets.) as a means of increasing [market efficiency](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%2012%20Market%20Efficiency.md) and providing [liquidity](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) in the markets.

## The Bottom Line

The [cash-and-carry](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md) trade is one variety of [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md), the practice of buying and selling the same asset in two markets in order to profit from the brief discrepancies in their prices.

The practice of [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) is perhaps best known in the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) markets, where miniscule differences in posted prices encourage such a strategy.

[Cash-and-carry](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md), though, relies on a different set of assets: one the "real" asset and a second a derivative based on that asset's price.
