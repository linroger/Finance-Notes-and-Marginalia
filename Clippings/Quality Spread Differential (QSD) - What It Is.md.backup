## What Is Quality Spread Differential (QSD)?

[Quality spread](.md) differential (QSD) is used to calculate the difference between market [interest rates]([Interest%20Rate%20Quotations)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) that two parties potentially entering into an [interest rate swap]([Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp) are able to achieve. It is a measurement that companies can use to gauge [counterparty risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterpartyrisk.asp) in an [interest rate swap](../Financial%20Engineering/Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md).

### Key Takeaways

- A [quality spread](.md) differential (QSD) is the difference between market [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) achieved by two parties who enter an [interest rate swap](../Financial%20Engineering/Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md).
- It is a measurement that companies can use to gauge counterparty risk in an [interest rate swap](../Financial%20Engineering/Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md).
- The QSD is calculated by subtracting the contracted market rate by the rate available to the counter-party on similar rate instruments.
- When the QSD is positive, the swap is considered to benefit both parties involved.

## Understanding Quality Spread Differential (QSD)

QSD is a measure used by companies of different creditworthiness in interest rate [swap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swap.asp) analysis. They use a QSD to gauge [default risk]([Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp). When the QSD is positive, the swap is considered to benefit both parties involved.

A [quality spread](.md) provides a [credit quality]([Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditquality.asp) measure for both parties involved in an [interest rate swap](../Financial%20Engineering/Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md). The quality differential is calculated by subtracting the contracted market rate by the rate available to the counter-party on similar rate instruments.

The difference between the two quality spreads can be calculated as follows:

- ***QSD = Fixed-rate debt premium differential - [Floating-rate debt](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) premium differential***

The fixed-rate debt differential is typically larger than that of the [floating-rate debt](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md).

### Tip

Bond investors can use the [quality spread](.md) to decide whether higher yields are worth the extra risk.

## Interest Rate Swaps

Interest rate swaps trade on institutional market exchanges or through direct agreements between [counterparties](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterparty.asp). They allow one entity to swap their [credit risk]([Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp) with another using different types of credit instruments.

A typical [interest rate swap](../Financial%20Engineering/Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) will include a [fixed rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedinterestrate.asp) and a [floating rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatinginterestrate.asp). A company that seeks to [hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp) against paying higher rates on its floating-rate bonds in a rising rate environment would swap the [floating-rate debt](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) for fixed-rate debt. The counterparty takes the opposite view of the market and believes rates will fall, so it wants the [floating-rate debt](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) to pay off its obligations and obtain a profit.

For example, a bank may swap its floating-rate bond debt currently at 6% for a fixed-rate bond debt of 6%. Companies can match debt with varying maturity lengths depending on the [swap contract](../Financial%20Instruments/Review%20Session%20Notes/Currency%20Swaps.md) length. Each company agrees to the swap using the instruments it has issued.

## Quality Spread Differential (QSD) Example

Here's an example of how QSDs work. Company A, swapping its [floating-rate debt](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md), will receive a fixed rate. Company B, swapping its fixed-rate debt, will receive a floating rate. The QSD is usually not calculated based on the rates of the instruments used. The creditworthiness of both companies is different.

If Company A (AAA-rated) uses a two-year term [floating-rate debt](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) at 6% and Company B (BBB-rated) uses a five-year fixed-rate debt at 6%, then the QSD would need to be calculated based on the rates versus the market rates.

Company Aâ€™s 6% rate on the two-year [floating-rate debt](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) compares to a 7% rate obtained for Company B on a two-year [floating-rate debt](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md), so this [quality spread](.md) is 1%. For a five-year fixed-rate debt, Company A pays 4% where Company B pays 6%, so the [quality spread](.md) is 2%. The key is to use similar products in the [quality spread](.md) calculation in order to compare rates of similar issues.

In the example above, this would be 2% minus 1%, resulting in a QSD of 1%. Remember, a positive QSD indicates a swap is in the interest of both parties because there is a favorable [default risk](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md). If the AAA-rated company had a significantly higher floating-rate premium to the lower [credit quality](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md) company, it would result in a negative QSD. This would likely cause the higher-rated company to seek a higher-rated counterpart.
