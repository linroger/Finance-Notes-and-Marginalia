## What Is an Over-the-Counter (OTC) Derivative?

An over-the-counter (OTC) derivative is a financial contract that does not trade on an asset exchange, and which can be tailored to each party's needs.

A [derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp) is a security with a price that is dependent upon or derived from one or more underlying assets. Its value is determined by fluctuations in the [[Risk Neutral Pricing of Options|underlying asset]]. The most common underlying assets include stocks, bonds, [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|commodities]], currencies, [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]], and market indexes. Depending on where [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] trade, they can be classified as over-the-counter or [exchange-traded](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange-traded-derivative.asp) (listed).

### Key Takeaways

- An over-the-counter (OTC) derivative is a financial contract that is arranged between two counterparties but with minimal intermediation or regulation.
- OTC [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] do not have standardized terms and they are not listed on an asset exchange.
- As an example, a forward and a [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] contract both can represent the same underlying, but the former is OTC while the latter is exchange-traded.

## How Over-the-Counter Derivatives Work

Over-the-counter [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] are private [[Contemporary Financial Intermediation Notes|financial contracts]] established between two or more [counterparties](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterparty.asp). In contrast, [listed [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange-traded-derivative.asp) trade on exchanges and are more structured and standardized contracts in which the underlying assets, the quantity of the underlying assets and settlement are specified by the exchange and subject to greater regulation.

[Over-the-counter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] are instead private contracts that are negotiated between counterparties without going through an exchange or other type of formal intermediaries, although a broker may help arrange the trade. Therefore, over-the-counter [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] could be negotiated and customized to suit the exact [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds|risk and return]] needed by each party. Although this type of derivative offers flexibility, it poses [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] because there is no clearing corporation.

Examples of OTC [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] include [[[Forwards and Futures|forwards]]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/102313/why-forward-contracts-are-foundation-all-[[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]].asp), [swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swap.asp), and [[[Exotic Interest Rate Options|exotic]] options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exoticoption.asp), among others.

## Example: Forwards vs. Futures

Forward and [[[Mathematics of the Financial Markets|futures contracts]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp) are similar in many ways: both involve the agreement to buy and sell assets at a future date and both have prices that are derived from some [[Risk Neutral Pricing of Options|underlying asset]].

A [[Forward Points in Currency|forward contract]], though, is an arrangement made over the counter between two counterparties that negotiate and arrive on the exact terms of the contract—such as its [[Risk Neutral Pricing of Options|expiration date]], how many units of the [[Risk Neutral Pricing of Options|underlying asset]] are represented in the contract, and what exactly the [[Risk Neutral Pricing of Options|underlying asset]] to be delivered is, among other factors. [[Forwards and Futures|Forwards]] settle just once at the end of the contract. [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|Futures]], on the other hand, are standardized contracts with fixed maturity dates and uniform underlyings. These are traded on exchanges and settled on a daily basis.

## Example: Swaptions

As another example, a swaption is a type of over-the-counter derivative that is not traded through exchanges. A [swaption](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swaption.asp) (or swap option) grants the holder of the security the right to enter into an underlying swap. However, the holder of the swaption is not obligated to enter into the underlying swap.

There are two types of swaptions: a payer and a receiver.

- A **[[Chapter 39 - Swaptions, Forward Swaps, and MBS|payer swaption]]** gives the owner the right to enter into a specified swap where the owner pays the [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|fixed leg]] and receives the [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|floating leg]].
- A **receiver swaption** gives the owner the right to enter into a swap in which they receive the [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|fixed leg]] and pays the [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|floating leg]].

The buyers and sellers of this over-the-counter derivative negotiate the price of the swaption, the length of the swaption period, the [[Chapter 36 - Currency Swaps|fixed interest rate]], and the frequency at which the floating interest rate is observed.
