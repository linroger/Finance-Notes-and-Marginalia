## What Is a Plain Vanilla Swap?

A [plain vanilla](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plainvanilla.asp) swap is one of the simplest [financial instruments](../Financial%20Instruments/A%20Practical%20Guide%20for%20Actuaries%20and%20other%20Business%20Professionals..md) contracted in the [over-the-counter market](../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20%20Pricing%20of%20Caps%20and%20Floors.md) between two private parties, both of which are usually firms or [financial institutions](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md). There are several types of plain vanilla swaps, including an [interest rate swap]([Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp), commodity swap, and a foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) swap. The term plain vanilla swap is most commonly used to describe an [interest rate swap](../Financial%20Engineering/Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) in which a floating interest rate is exchanged for a fixed rate or vice versa.

### Key Takeaways

- A plain vanilla swap is the simplest type of swap in the market, often used to hedge floating [interest rate exposure](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2013%20-%20Banks%20Asset-Liability%20Management/Duration%20Gap%20Management.md).
- There are various types of plain vanilla swaps, including interest rate, commodity, and [currency swaps](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md).
- Generally, both legs of the swap are denominated in the same [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md), and interest payments are netted.

## Understanding a Plain Vanilla Swap

A plain vanilla [interest rate swap](../Financial%20Engineering/Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) is often done to hedge a floating rate exposure, although it can also be done to take advantage of a declining rate environment by moving from a fixed to a floating rate. Both legs of the swap are denominated in the same [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md), and interest payments are netted. The [notional principal]([Fundamentals%20of%20Swaps)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/notionalprincipalamount.asp) does not change during the life of the swap, and there are no embedded options.

## Types of Plain Vanilla Swaps

The most common plain vanilla swap is a floating rate [interest rate swap](../Financial%20Engineering/Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md). Now, the most common floating rate index is the [London Interbank Offered Rate]([Short-Term%20Rates%20and%20the%20Transition%20from%20LIBOR)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp) (LIBOR), which is set daily by the International [Commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) Exchange (ICE). LIBOR is posted for five currenciesâ€”the U.S. dollar, euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, and British pound. Maturities range from overnight to 12 months. The rate is set based on a survey of between 11 and 18 major banks.

### Important

The Intercontinental Exchange, the authority responsible for LIBOR, will stop publishing one-week and two-month USD LIBOR after Dec. 31, 2021. All other LIBOR will be discontinued after June 30, 2023.

The most common floating rate reset period is every three months, with semi-annual payments. The day count convention on the [floating leg](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) is generally actual/360 for the U.S. dollar and the euro, or actual/365 for the British pound, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. The interest on the floating rate leg is accrued and compounded for six months, while the fixed-rate payment is calculated on a simple 30/360 or 30/365 basis, depending on the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). The interest due on the floating rate leg is compared with that due on the fixed-rate leg, and only the net difference is paid.

## Example of a Plain Vanilla Swap

In a plain vanilla [interest rate swap](../Financial%20Engineering/Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md), Company A and Company B choose a maturity, [principal amount](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/HSBC-Auto%20callable%20Barrier%20Notes%20with%20Step-up%20Premium.md), [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md), [fixed interest rate]([Chapter%2036%20-%20Currency%20Swaps)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedinterestrate.asp), floating interest rate index, and rate reset and payment dates. On the specified payment dates for the life of the swap, Company A pays Company B an amount of interest calculated by applying the fixed rate to the [principal amount](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/HSBC-Auto%20callable%20Barrier%20Notes%20with%20Step-up%20Premium.md), and Company B pays Company A the amount derived from applying the floating interest rate to the [principal amount](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/HSBC-Auto%20callable%20Barrier%20Notes%20with%20Step-up%20Premium.md). Only the netted difference between the interest payments changes hands.
