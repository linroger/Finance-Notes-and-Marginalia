## What Is a Swap?

A swap is a derivative contract through which two parties exchange the cash flows or liabilities from two different [[A Practical Guide for Actuaries and other Business Professionals.|financial instruments]]. Most swaps involve cash flows based on a [[Fundamentals of Swaps|notional principal]] amount related to a loan or bond, although the security can be almost anything. Usually, the principal does not change hands.

Each [[Preview of the Book|cash flow]] comprises one leg of the swap. One [[Preview of the Book|cash flow]] is generally fixed, while the other is variable and based on a benchmark interest rate, floating [[Currency Swap Basics|currency exchange]] rate, or index price.

The most common kind of swap is an [[Primer on Interest Rate Swaps|interest rate swap]]. Swaps do not trade on typical exchanges, and generally, retail investors do not engage in them. Rather, swaps are transacted over the counter (OTC) or on security-based Swap Execution Facilities (SEFs). They occur primarily between businesses or [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial institutions]].

- [Interest rate swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp) are the most commonly used swaps and usually involve a [[Chapter 36 - Currency Swaps|fixed interest rate]] and a variable interest rate.
- Credit default swaps contributed to the causes of the 2008 [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]].
- Institutions evaluate their outlooks for, e.g., interest rate movements, when they consider entering into an [[Primer on Interest Rate Swaps|interest rate swap]].

## Understanding Swaps

In an [[Primer on Interest Rate Swaps|interest rate swap]], the parties to the contract [[Fundamentals of Swaps|exchange cash flows]] based on a [[[Fundamentals of Swaps|notional principal]] amount](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/notionalprincipalamount.asp) of an underlying security. The amount of the principal is not actually exchanged. But the cash flows related to the [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] are. Also, the swap can be an [amortizing swap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortizing-swap.asp), where the underlying principal of a loan will decrease over time.

Parties undertake swaps in order to [hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp) (protect against) [[[Analysis of Fixed Income Securities|interest rate risk]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp) or to [speculate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculation.asp). For example, imagine that ABC Co. has just issued $1 million in five-year bonds with a variable [[Continuously Compounding Interest|annual interest rate]] defined as the [[[SOFR|Secured Overnight Financing Rate]] (SOFR)](https://www.investopedia.com/secured-overnight-financing-rate-sofr-4683954) plus 1.3% (or 130 basis points). Also, assume that the SOFR is at 2.5% and ABC’s management is anxious about an interest rate rise.

Take the Next Step to Invest

The management team finds another company, XYZ Inc., that is willing to pay ABC an annual rate of the SOFR plus 1.3% on a [[Fundamentals of Swaps|notional principal]] amount of $1 million for five years. In other words, XYZ will fund ABC’s interest payments on its latest bond issue.

In exchange, ABC agrees to pay XYZ a fixed annual rate of 5% on a notional value of $1 million for five years. ABC will benefit from the swap if rates rise significantly over the next five years. XYZ will benefit if rates fall, stay flat, or rise only gradually.

### Important

LIBOR is no longer used as a benchmark index rate for short-[[Short-Term Rates and the Transition from LIBOR|term loans]] between [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial institutions]]. It will cease publication of rates on Sept. 30, 2024. The benchmark index now used is the [[SOFR|Secured Overnight Financing Rate]] (SOFR) and its one-month, six-month, and nine-month extensions.

## Calculations of Gains or Losses

Below are two scenarios for the [[Primer on Interest Rate Swaps|interest rate swap]] described above. In the first scenario, the SOFR rises 0.75% per year. In the second scenario, the SOFR rises 0.25% per year. Remember, XYZ Inc. has agreed to make an annual payment to the ABC company in the amount of the SOFR plus 1.3% on a [[HSBC-Auto callable Barrier Notes with Step-up Premium|principal amount]] of $1 million for five years. ABC has agreed to pay XYZ an annual amount equal to 5% of $1 million for that time period.

### Scenario 1

As the SOFR rises by 0.75% per year, ABC’s total interest payments to its bondholders over the five-year period (and paid by XYZ) amount to $265,000. But thanks to the swap, that figure is offset by a $15,000 gain. Let’s break down the calculation:

|  | **LIBOR + 1.30%** | **Variable Interest Paid by XYZ to ABC** | **5% Interest Paid by ABC to XYZ** | **ABC’s Gain/Loss** | **XYZ’s Gain/Loss** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Year 1** | 3.80% | $38,000 | $50,000 | \-$12,000 | $12,000 |
| **Year 2** | 4.55% | $45,500 | $50,000 | \-$4,500 | $4,500 |
| **Year 3** | 5.30% | $53,000 | $50,000 | $3,000 | \-$3,000 |
| **Year 4** | 6.05% | $60,500 | $50,000 | $10,500 | \-$10,500 |
| **Year 5** | 6.80% | $68,000 | $50,000 | $18,000 | \-$18,000 |
| **Total** |  | $265,000 | $250,000 | $15,000 | ($15,000) |

In this scenario, ABC did well because, thanks to the swap, it fixed its interest rate at 5%. ABC paid $15,000 less than it would have with the variable rate. XYZ’s interest rate forecast was incorrect; the company lost $15,000 through the swap because rates rose faster than it had expected.

### Scenario 2

In the second scenario, the SOFR rises by 0.25% per year:

|  | **LIBOR + 1.30%** | **Variable Interest Paid by XYZ to ABC** | **5% Interest Paid by ABC to XYZ** | **ABC’s Gain/Loss** | **XYZ’s Gain/Loss** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Year 1** | 3.80% | $38,000 | $50,000 | ($12,000) | $12,000 |
| **Year 2** | 4.05% | $40,500 | $50,000 | ($9,500) | $9,500 |
| **Year 3** | 4.30% | $43,000 | $50,000 | ($7,000) | $7,000 |
| **Year 4** | 4.55% | $45,500 | $50,000 | ($4,500) | $4,500 |
| **Year 5** | 4.80% | $48,000 | $50,000 | ($2,000) | $2,000 |
| **Total** |  | $215,000 | $250,000 | ($35,000) | $35,000 |

In this case, ABC would have been better off by not engaging in the swap because [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] rose slowly. Because its interest rate forecast was correct, XYZ received $35,000 more than it paid out.

### Additional Factors

This example does not account for the other benefits ABC might have received by engaging in the swap. For example, perhaps the company needed another loan, but lenders were unwilling to extend one unless the interest obligations on its other bonds were fixed.

In most cases, the two parties would act through a bank or other intermediary, which would take a cut of the swap. Whether it is advantageous for two entities to enter into an [[Primer on Interest Rate Swaps|interest rate swap]] depends on their [comparative advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comparativeadvantage.asp) in fixed- or [floating-rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatinginterestrate.asp) lending markets.

## Other Swaps

Swaps involve more than interest rate payments. In fact, there are many [types of swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/052915/different-types-swaps.asp). However, relatively common arrangements include commodity swaps, [[Financial Instruments PSET Solutions|currency swaps]], debt swaps, and [[Chapter 43 - Securitisation, ABSs and CDOs|total return swaps]].

### Commodity Swaps

[Commodity swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodityswap.asp) involve the exchange of a floating commodity price, such as the Brent Crude oil [spot price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spotprice.asp), for a set price over an agreed-upon period. Commodity swaps most commonly involve crude oil.

### Currency Swaps

In a [[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] swap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyswap.asp), the parties exchange [[Notes on Currency Swaps|interest and principal]] payments on debt denominated in different currencies. Cash flows are based on a fixed rate and a variable rate (which is based on the [floating [[Currency Swap Basics|currency exchange]] rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatingexchangerate.asp)). Unlike with an [[Primer on Interest Rate Swaps|interest rate swap]], the principal is not a notional amount, but it is exchanged along with interest obligations.

[[Financial Instruments PSET Solutions|Currency swaps]] can take place between countries. For example, China has used swaps with Argentina, helping the latter stabilize its [foreign reserves](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/international-reserves.asp). The [U.S. Federal Reserve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp) engaged in an aggressive swap strategy with European [central banks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp) during the 2010 European [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]] to stabilize the euro, which was falling in value due to the Greek [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007–2011)|debt crisis]].

### Debt-Equity Swaps

A [debt-[[Equity Commodity and Exotic Swaps|equity swap]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityswap.asp) involves the exchange of debt for equity*.* In the case of a publicly traded company, this would mean bonds for stocks. It is a way for companies to refinance their debt or reallocate their [[[Introduction to Corporate Finance|capital structure]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp).

### Total Return Swaps

In a [total return swap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totalreturnswap.asp), the total return from an asset is exchanged for a [[Chapter 36 - Currency Swaps|fixed interest rate]]. This gives the party paying the fixed-rate exposure to the [[Risk Neutral Pricing of Options|underlying asset]]*—*a stock or an [index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketindex.asp). For example, an investor could pay a fixed rate to one party in return for the capital appreciation plus [dividend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) payments of a pool of stocks.

### Credit Default Swap (CDS)

A [[[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] (CDS)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp) consists of an agreement by one party to pay the lost principal and interest of a loan to the CDS buyer if a borrower [defaults](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) on a loan. Excessive [[[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products|leverage]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products|leverage]].asp) and poor [[Financial Mathematics Course|risk management]] in the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]] were contributing causes of the 2008 [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]].

## What Is the Purpose of a Swap?

A swap allows counterparties to [[Fundamentals of Swaps|exchange cash flows]]. For instance, an entity receiving or paying a [[Chapter 36 - Currency Swaps|fixed interest rate]] may prefer to swap that for a variable rate (or vice versa). Or, the holder of a cash-flow-generating asset may wish to swap that for the [[Preview of the Book|cash flow]] of a different asset. The purpose of such a swap is to manage risk, to obtain funding at a more favorable rate than would be available through other means, or to speculate on future differences between the swapped cash flows.

## How Is a Swap Structured?

A swap is a derivative product that typically involves two counterparties that agree to [[Fundamentals of Swaps|exchange cash flows]] over a certain time period, such as a year. The exact terms of the swap agreement are negotiated by the counterparties and are then formalized in a legal contract. These terms will include precisely what is to be swapped and between whom, the notional amount of the principal, the maturity of the contract, and any contingencies. The cash flows that are ultimately exchanged are computed based on the terms of the contract, which may involve an interest rate, index, or other underlying financial instrument.

## Who Uses Swaps?

Swaps are mainly used by [[Chapter 4 Institutional Trading|institutional investors]] such as banks and other [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial institutions]], governments, and some corporations. Their intended use is to manage a variety of risks, such as [[Analysis of Fixed Income Securities|interest rate risk]], [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] risk, and price risk.

## Are Swaps Regulated?

Today, many swaps in the United States are regulated by the [[[Financial Instruments PSET Solutions|Commodity Futures]] Trading Commission (CFTC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cftc.asp) and sometimes the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), even though they usually trade over the counter (OTC). Due to the Wall Street reforms in the 2010 [[Credit Derivative Indexes|Dodd-Frank Act]], swaps in the U.S. must use a [Swap Execution Facility (SEF)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swap-execution-facility-sef.asp), which is an electronic platform that allows participants to buy and sell swaps pursuant to regulation. The regulation of swaps is aimed at ensuring that these [[A Practical Guide for Actuaries and other Business Professionals.|financial instruments]] are traded in a fair and transparent manner, and to reduce the risk of systemic financial failure (since swaps were blamed, in part, for the 2008 [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]]). The specific regulations that apply to swaps internationally vary by jurisdiction.

## The Bottom Line

A swap is a derivative contract that sets forth how one party exchanges (or swaps) the cash flows or value of one asset for another. Swaps are over-the-counter contracts primarily between businesses or [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial institutions]], and are not generally intended for retail investors.

The most common type of swap is an [[Primer on Interest Rate Swaps|interest rate swap]], where the parties exchange fixed and variable interest rate flows [based on a [[Fundamentals of Swaps|notional principal]] amount](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/050715/how-read-interest-rate-swap-quotes.asp). Such swaps can be used to hedge [[Analysis of Fixed Income Securities|interest rate risk]] or to speculate on [[Forward Rate|future interest rate]] changes.
