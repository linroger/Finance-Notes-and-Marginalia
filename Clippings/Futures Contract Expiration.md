A [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract expiration is the countdown clock of this part of the trading world. It marks the last day that you can trade a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract before it expires. After this day, the contract is settled in cash or through the physical delivery of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md), depending on the terms of the agreement.

## Why Do Futures Contracts Expire?

Just as a loaf of bread or carton of milk has an [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md), so does a [futures]([Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry) contract](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp). A [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is an agreement to buy or sell an [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) at a future date at a predetermined price. Expiration ensures all obligations are met and finalized through [cash settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Swaptions.md) or physical delivery. It keeps the market orderly and reduces risk.

Without a firm [expiration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expiration-time.asp) date, contracts would linger indefinitely, creating uncertainty and increasing the risk of market manipulation. The [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) acts as a clearing mechanism, essentially sweeping the market clean of obligations and allowing for a fresh start.

By setting a finite life span for each [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract, the market reduces the risk that one party will [default](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) on its obligations. As the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) approaches, traders know they need to settle or roll over their contracts. The pressure of a specific end date keeps everyone on their toes and ensures that contracts are less likely to go unfulfilled.

### Hedging and Expiration Dates

Another vital role that expiration dates play is for [hedging]([Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging)](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/[hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)-beginners-guide/). Hedgers enter into [futures contracts](../Financial%20Engineering/Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) to protect against the volatility of asset prices in the [spot market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spotmarket.asp). They’re not necessarily in it for the profit, but for the stability and [risk management](../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) that [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) can offer.

Hedgers can use the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) of a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract to align their hedges with a specific financial need or obligation in the future. This is particularly important for producers or consumers [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) against price changes in [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) like oil, agricultural products, or metals. By choosing a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract with an expiration that matches their expected need date, hedgers can create a more effective and accurate hedge.

### Example: A Forward Hedge in the Corn Market

Suppose you’re a farmer who has just planted corn, expecting to harvest your crop in six months. You’re worried that corn prices could fall by then, leaving you with less revenue to cover your costs. To protect against this risk, you enter a forward hedge by selling a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract that expires in six months when the corn is planted.

By doing this, you lock in a price for your corn today, effectively setting a guaranteed selling price for the future. If corn prices do fall, the loss in your crop’s value is offset by gains from the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract. Otherwise, if prices rise, you’ll get less for your corn than you would have without the hedge, but you are protected against the [downside risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downsiderisk.asp).

By aligning the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) of the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract with the timing of your corn harvest, you’ve effectively hedged against price risk. This is a classic example of how the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) can be a strategic tool for hedgers as they align their [financial instruments](../Financial%20Instruments/A%20Practical%20Guide%20for%20Actuaries%20and%20other%20Business%20Professionals..md) with real-world needs.

### Fast Fact

When you trade [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), you aren’t buying or selling the actual asset, such as oil, gold, or wheat. Rather, you’re agreeing to buy or sell the asset at a specific future date. When that date arrives, it’s “game over” for that contract. Traders must then either settle up or move their positions to a new contract with a later [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md).

## How Futures Contract Expiration Works

The [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) is a built-in deadline when both parties—the buyer and the seller—must fulfill their obligations. When a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract expires, it’s time to settle up. This can be done in two ways: through a [cash settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Swaptions.md) or physical delivery of the [underlying asset]([Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp).

### Cash Settlement

In some markets, the contract is settled in cash rather than dealing with the hassle of shipping a truckload of soybeans or moving bars of gold. The cash amount is the difference between the contract and the market price at the time of expiration. This is common for [futures contracts](../Financial%20Engineering/Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) on financial products like [indexes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp).

- **Final trading day**: Each cash-settled contract has a final trading day, after which trading stops and settlement begins.
- **Price determination**: The [final settlement price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/EURIBOR%20Futures%20Options.md) is usually based on a specific calculation or an average of prices over a certain period, depending on the contract’s terms.
- **Clearinghouse involvement**: The [clearinghouse](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearinghouse.asp) calculates the difference between the [final settlement price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/EURIBOR%20Futures%20Options.md) and the original contract price for each position.
- **Account adjustment**: Profits or losses are then credited or debited to each trader’s corresponding [margin account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaccount.asp).
- **Contract closure**: Once the [cash settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Swaptions.md) is complete, the contract is considered closed, and there are no further obligations between the contracting parties.

### Physical Delivery

In certain markets, the expiration of the contract means that the physical goods change hands. For example, if you’ve contracted to buy 1,000 barrels of oil, those barrels are delivered to a location specified in the contract.

- **Notice of intent**: As the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) nears, the seller issues a notice of intent to deliver to the clearinghouse, which then notifies the buyer.
- **Delivery location and time**: The specific location of the delivery point and the time frame for delivery are outlined in the contract’s terms.
- **Inspection**: Typically, the goods are inspected for quality upon delivery to ensure that they meet the contract requirements.
- **Payment and transfer**: Once inspected and approved, payment is made, often through a [letter of credit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/letterofcredit.asp), and ownership of the commodity moves from the seller to the buyer at the specified delivery price.
- **Contract closure**: After the physical goods have been transferred and payment made, the contract is considered settled and closed.

Understanding these mechanics gives you a clearer picture of what happens when a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract expires. Whether financially squaring up or exchanging goods, the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) sets the wheels in motion, ensuring that the market is smooth and efficient.

## Finding Futures Expiration Dates

Expiration dates aren’t one-size-fits-all. Rather, they vary depending on the commodity or financial instrument. These dates are publicly listed on the websites of [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) exchanges and are usually outlined in the contract specifications.

The most direct way to find an [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) is to consult the website of the exchange where the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is traded. Exchanges like the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cme.asp), the [New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nymex.asp), and the [Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intercontinentalexchange.asp) usually have contract details, including expiration dates. These are generally in a section labeled “Contract Specifications,” “Expiration Calendar,” or something similar.

Most brokers and platforms also give you access to these specs. This includes the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). For some platforms, you might need to hover over the contract name or click on an info button to see these details.

### Tip

Remember that the expiration time might be in a different time zone, usually for the exchange where the contract is listed. Make sure to adjust for your local time to avoid any timing mishaps.

## The Impact of Expiration Dates on Trading Positions

As a contract nears its [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md), its price can become more [volatile](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp). This is because traders are jockeying for position, either exiting their contracts or rolling them over to a new [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). This period requires considerable attention, as the stakes and risks are higher.

The market’s [liquidity]([Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[liquidity](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md).asp) for a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract can also diminish as it nears expiration. Many traders prefer not to enter new positions in a contract that’s about to expire, potentially making it a challenge to execute large orders at favorable prices.

A fascinating phenomenon that occurs as a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract nears expiration is the [convergence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convergence.asp) of the [futures price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) and the spot price of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). This happens because the [arbitrage]([Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/[arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md).asp) opportunities diminish, forcing the [futures price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) to align more closely with the current market price.

### Important

Never underestimate the psychological aspects of trading. As expiration nears, the emotional stakes can rise, leading traders to make impulsive decisions based on short-term moves rather than long-term goals.

## Rolling Over Contracts: A Key Strategy in Futures Trading

For those who want to maintain a position in the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) market, the approach of an [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) means it’s time to consider [rolling over the contract](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/073015/how-do-[futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)-contracts-roll-over.asp). This means closing out your current position in an expiring [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract and simultaneously opening a similar position in a contract with a later [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). This enables you to continue your market exposure without being obligated to settle the expiring contract, either through cash or physical delivery.

## Managing Expiration Risk: Effective Strategies and Tips

Managing the risk associated with [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract expiration requires a keen eye and a solid strategy. Here are some tips:

- **Set alerts**: Use trading software to set reminders for when your contracts are nearing expiration.
- **Do your research**: Know the market conditions for your asset as the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) nears.
- **Have an exit plan**: Decide in advance whether you’ll roll over the contract, close it out before it expires, or settle it, and act accordingly.
- **Don’t forget to roll over**: Timing is important if you plan to roll over the contract. Ideally, you want to [switch before [liquidity](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) dries up](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/switch.asp) in the expiring contract, but not so early that you miss out on potential gains.

## Can I Avoid Futures Expiration Altogether?

No, you can’t entirely avoid expiration when trading [futures contracts](../Financial%20Engineering/Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md). However, you can prolong your market exposure by rolling over your contract to a new one with a later [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). This is a common practice for traders who want to maintain their positions.

Rolling over involves simultaneously closing your existing contract and entering a similar one that expires later. But remember, each rollover likely has costs and tax implications.

## What Happens If I Ignore or Forget the Expiration Date?

Ignoring the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) is not advisable. If you don’t act, the contract will reach its natural conclusion, through either [cash settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Swaptions.md) or physical delivery, depending on the contract’s terms.

If it’s a cash-settled contract, the settlement will be calculated based on the market prices at expiration and credited or debited to your account. For contracts requiring physical delivery, however, failing to exit your position could mean you’re obligated to take or make actual delivery of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md), which can be complicated and costly.

## Can Traders Profit from Futures Expiration?

Some traders specialize in strategies that focus on the price moves and volatility that typically occur as contracts near their expiration. These expiration plays are typically short-term strategies that seek to capitalize on the unique market dynamics during this period. However, they tend to be higher-risk and require a deep understanding of the market.

## Do All Futures Markets Have the Same Expiration Dates?

No. Different [futures markets](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md) have varying expiration schedules. For example, agricultural [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) might expire seasonally, while financial indexes could expire monthly or quarterly. Always check the specific expiration dates for the particular market that interests you.

## The Bottom Line

Understanding [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract expiration is like having a good grasp of the rules of a game.
