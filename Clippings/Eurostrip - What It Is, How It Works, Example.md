## What Is a Eurostrip?

A eurostrip, short for "[[Convexity-Adjusted Models for LIBOR Forwards Qu|eurodollar futures]] strip," is a type of [interest rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) derivative that allows the holder to hedge against changes in [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]]. It consists of buying a series of three-month [[Mathematics of the Financial Markets|futures contracts]] known as [eurodollars](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eurodollar.asp). Therefore, if a [trader](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp) wishes to hedge their risk for one year, they would buy four consecutive eurodollar contracts, each lasting for three months.

### Key Takeaways

- Eurostrips are a popular derivative transaction.
- They consist of a series, or "strip," of consecutive [[Convexity-Adjusted Models for LIBOR Forwards Qu|eurodollar futures]] contracts.
- Although they are mainly used to hedge [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] risk, eurostrips are also used by traders who wish to speculate on interest rate movements.

## Understanding Eurostrips

Eurostrips are a colloquial name used by [derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp) traders to refer to a series of transactions involving eurodollar [[[Mathematics of the Financial Markets|futures contracts]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp). Eurodollars are essentially U.S. dollar-denominated deposits held at foreign banks or at U.S. banks' overseas branches.

As is so often the case in modern finance, there exists an active derivative market based on these [[Characteristics of the Eurodollar Market|eurodollar deposits]]. Specifically, ever since 1981, the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cme.asp) has facilitated trading in [[Characteristics of the Eurodollar Market|eurodollar deposits]] using [cash-settled](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashsettlement.asp) [[Convexity-Adjusted Models for LIBOR Forwards Qu|eurodollar futures]] contracts.

These contracts have as their [[[Risk Neutral Pricing of Options|underlying asset]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying.asp) [[Characteristics of the Eurodollar Market|eurodollar deposits]] with principal values of $1 million and maturity periods of three months. The value of these [[Mathematics of the Financial Markets|futures contracts]] fluctuates based on the three-month U.S. dollar [[[Short-Term Rates and the Transition from LIBOR|London Interbank Offered Rate]] (LIBOR)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp). Therefore, traders can use [[Convexity-Adjusted Models for LIBOR Forwards Qu|eurodollar futures]] to hedge against or speculate on changes to [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]].

### Important

The Intercontinental Exchange, the authority responsible for LIBOR, will stop publishing one-week and two-month USD LIBOR after Dec. 31, 2021. All other LIBOR will be discontinued after June 30, 2023.

Eurostrips are a derivative transaction in which the trader purchases a series of back-to-back [[Convexity-Adjusted Models for LIBOR Forwards Qu|eurodollar futures]] contracts. The length of the chain will vary depending on the trader's intentions. For instance, a trader wishing to [hedge or speculate](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-[[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|hedging]]-and-speculation/) one year into the future would construct a eurostrip based on four [[Convexity-Adjusted Models for LIBOR Forwards Qu|eurodollar futures]] (three months each, 12 months in total), a trader looking six months ahead would buy two [[Mathematics of the Financial Markets|futures contracts]], and so on.

The end result of [[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|hedging]] using eurostrips is the same as that of using [interest rate swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp), but the two contracts are traded differently and have a different set of cash flows. One choice may be more desirable than another at a given time to meet a specific [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] objective, or both may be used together. Eurostrips are popular because of their flexibility to be structured in many different ways to meet a variety of [[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|hedging]] needs.

Although eurostrips are most commonly used to hedge interest rate risks, they can also be used to speculate on LIBOR or on the shape of the [[[Valuing Interest Rate Caps and Floors Using QuantLib Python|interest rate term structure]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termstructure.asp).

## Real World Example of a Eurostrip

To illustrate, suppose you operate a global [[[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] bank](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/[[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]-[[HKS The Banking Industry|banking]].asp) based in Paris, which holds U.S. dollar deposits in its European branches. You are unsure about the future direction of [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] and are therefore eager to hedge against the foreign exchange risk associated with these dollar holdings.

To hedge against this risk, you create a eurostrip position by taking a [[[Chapter 4 - Futures: Hedging and Speculation|long position]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) in four consecutive [[Convexity-Adjusted Models for LIBOR Forwards Qu|eurodollar futures]] contracts. Because each contract lasts for three months, this eurostrip position effectively hedges your [[Duration Gap Management|interest rate exposure]] for one year.
