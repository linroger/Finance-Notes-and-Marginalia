## What Is a Fixed Income Forward?

A [[Lecture Notes Bonds,  Preferred Stock,  and Structured Products|fixed income]] forward is a [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] contract to buy or sell [fixed-income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedincome.asp) securities at some date in the future, but at a price accepted today.

[[Lecture Notes Bonds,  Preferred Stock,  and Structured Products|Fixed income]] refers to a type of [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] in which real return rates or periodic income is received at regular intervals and reasonably predictable levels. Investors may use [forward contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp) on fixed-income securities to lock in a bond price today while taking ownership or [[Class Slides On Repurchase Agreements|selling the security]] itself in the future.

### Key Takeaways

- A [[Lecture Notes Bonds,  Preferred Stock,  and Structured Products|fixed income]] forward is an agreement to transact in a fixed-income security at a preset price at some date in the future (the forward date).
- The value of a [[Forward Points in Currency|forward contract]] is the bond price less the present value of [[Realized Returns|coupon payments]] less the present value of the price at expiration.
- Forward contracts are used to mitigate the risk associated with [[Black Models for Bond Price Options Capsfloors|price volatility]] between today and some future date.
- [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|Futures]] are similar to forward contracts but standardized. Forward contracts can be customized.

## How a Fixed Income Forward Works

The risk in holding [[Lecture Notes Bonds,  Preferred Stock,  and Structured Products|fixed income]] forward contracts is that market [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] for the underlying bonds can increase or decrease. These changes affect the bond’s yield and thus its price. [Forward rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardrate.asp) then become the focus of investor attention, especially if the market for the fixed-income security is considered [volatile](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp). A [[Forward Points in Currency|forward rate]] is the interest rate that’s applicable to a financial transaction that will take place in the future.

### Important

The buyer of a [[Forward Points in Currency|forward contract]] is betting that the price will rise above the [[Forward Contracts and Forward Prices|forward price]] between today and the forward date. The seller expects the opposite.

## Special Considerations

### Pricing a Fixed Income Forward

To calculate the price of a [[Lecture Notes Bonds,  Preferred Stock,  and Structured Products|fixed income]] [[Forward Points in Currency|forward contract]] you subtract the [present value (PV)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp) of [[Realized Returns|coupon payments]], over the life of the contract, from the bond price. This value is compounded by the [[Black Scholes Derivation|risk-free rate]] over the life of the option. The [[[Black Scholes Derivation|risk-free rate]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-freerate.asp) represents the interest an investor would expect from an entirely risk-free [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] over a specified period.

The value of the contract is the bond price, less the present value of coupons, less the present value of the price which will be paid at expiration (bond price - PV coupons - PV price paid at expiration).

### Profiting from a Fixed Income Forward

Profiting from a [[Lecture Notes Bonds,  Preferred Stock,  and Structured Products|fixed income]] forward depends on which side of the contract the investor is on. A buyer enters the contract hoping the market price of the bond will be higher in the future since the difference between the contracted price and the [market price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp) represents profit. The seller expects that the bond price will fall.

While the number of [coupon](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon.asp) payments for the life of the bond may exceed the life of the contract, consideration is only on the payments due during the contract period. This payment limitation is caused by some bonds having maturities that are much longer than the [[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|duration]] of the contract. Contract participants are [[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|hedging]] for price movements over a shorter period.

[[Lecture Notes Bonds,  Preferred Stock,  and Structured Products|Fixed income]] forward contracts are favorite instruments for investors who are looking to [hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp) interest rate or other risks in the bond market. Other traders are attracted to the [[Lecture Notes Bonds,  Preferred Stock,  and Structured Products|fixed income]] [[Tba and Specified Pools Markets|forward market]] to profit from anomalies between the forward and [spot markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spotmarket.asp) for bonds and other [[Corporate Bonds and Loans|debt instruments]].

## Fixed Income Forward vs. Fixed Income Future

[[6. A Brief Introduction to Stochastic Calculus|Fixed income derivatives]] may be traded on [exchanges](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp), where the underlying bond and terms of the contract are standardized. Unlike a [[Forward Points in Currency|forward contract]] that trades [over-the-counter (OTC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp), a standardized [[Lecture Notes Bonds,  Preferred Stock,  and Structured Products|fixed income]] derivative is an exchange-traded [[[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] contract](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp). These exchanges publish these rates along with the types of bonds accepted as payment. Otherwise, [[Forward and Futures Contracts|forwards and futures]] operate in similar fashion.
