## What Is a Fixed Income Forward?

A [fixed income](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) forward is a [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) contract to buy or sell [fixed-income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedincome.asp) securities at some date in the future, but at a price accepted today.

[Fixed income](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) refers to a type of [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in which real return rates or periodic income is received at regular intervals and reasonably predictable levels. Investors may use [forward contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp) on fixed-income securities to lock in a bond price today while taking ownership or [selling the security](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Slides%20On%20Repurchase%20Agreements.md) itself in the future.

### Key Takeaways

- A [fixed income](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) forward is an agreement to transact in a fixed-income security at a preset price at some date in the future (the forward date).
- The value of a [forward contract](Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) is the bond price less the present value of [coupon payments](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) less the present value of the price at expiration.
- Forward contracts are used to mitigate the risk associated with [price volatility](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Black%20Models%20for%20Bond%20Price%20Options%20Capsfloors.md) between today and some future date.
- [Futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) are similar to forward contracts but standardized. Forward contracts can be customized.

## How a Fixed Income Forward Works

The risk in holding [fixed income](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) forward contracts is that market [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) for the underlying bonds can increase or decrease. These changes affect the bond’s yield and thus its price. [Forward rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardrate.asp) then become the focus of investor attention, especially if the market for the fixed-income security is considered [volatile](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp). A [forward rate](Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) is the interest rate that’s applicable to a financial transaction that will take place in the future.

### Important

The buyer of a [forward contract](Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) is betting that the price will rise above the [forward price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) between today and the forward date. The seller expects the opposite.

## Special Considerations

### Pricing a Fixed Income Forward

To calculate the price of a [fixed income](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) [forward contract](Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) you subtract the [present value (PV)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp) of [coupon payments](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md), over the life of the contract, from the bond price. This value is compounded by the [risk-free rate](../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md) over the life of the option. The [risk-free rate]([Black%20Scholes%20Derivation)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-freerate.asp) represents the interest an investor would expect from an entirely risk-free [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) over a specified period.

The value of the contract is the bond price, less the present value of coupons, less the present value of the price which will be paid at expiration (bond price - PV coupons - PV price paid at expiration).

### Profiting from a Fixed Income Forward

Profiting from a [fixed income](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) forward depends on which side of the contract the investor is on. A buyer enters the contract hoping the market price of the bond will be higher in the future since the difference between the contracted price and the [market price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp) represents profit. The seller expects that the bond price will fall.

While the number of [coupon](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon.asp) payments for the life of the bond may exceed the life of the contract, consideration is only on the payments due during the contract period. This payment limitation is caused by some bonds having maturities that are much longer than the [duration](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the contract. Contract participants are [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) for price movements over a shorter period.

[Fixed income](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) forward contracts are favorite instruments for investors who are looking to [hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp) interest rate or other risks in the bond market. Other traders are attracted to the [fixed income](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) [forward market](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md) to profit from anomalies between the forward and [spot markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spotmarket.asp) for bonds and other [debt instruments](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Corporate%20Bonds%20and%20Loans.md).

## Fixed Income Forward vs. Fixed Income Future

[Fixed income derivatives](../Financial%20Engineering/6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md) may be traded on [exchanges](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp), where the underlying bond and terms of the contract are standardized. Unlike a [forward contract](Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) that trades [over-the-counter (OTC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp), a standardized [fixed income](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) derivative is an exchange-traded [futures]([Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry) contract](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp). These exchanges publish these rates along with the types of bonds accepted as payment. Otherwise, [forwards and futures](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Forward%20and%20Futures%20Contracts.md) operate in similar fashion.
