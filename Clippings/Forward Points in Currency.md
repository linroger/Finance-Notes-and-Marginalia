## What Are Forward Points?

In [currency trading](.md), forward points are the number of [basis points](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp) added to or subtracted from the current [spot rate]([The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spot_rate.asp) of a [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) pair to determine the [forward rate](.md) for delivery on a specific value date. When points are added to the [spot rate](../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) this is called a forward premium; when points are subtracted from the [spot rate](../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) it is a forward discount.

The [forward rate]([Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardrate.asp) is based on the difference between the [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) of the two currencies ([currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) deals always involve two currencies) and the time until the maturity of the deal. Forward points are also known as the [forward spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forward-spread.asp).

Basis points can be either added or taken away from the [spot rate](../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md). If they are added, they are forward points. If subtracted, they are discount points.

### Key Takeaways

- In [currency trading](.md), forward points are the number of basis points added to or subtracted from the current [spot rate](../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) of a [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) pair to determine the [forward rate](.md) for delivery on a specific value date.
- A [discount spread](.md) is the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) forward points that are subtracted from the [spot rate](../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md), to obtain a [forward rate](.md) for a [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).

## Understanding Forward Points

Forward points are used to calculate the price for both an outright [forward contract]([Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp) and a [foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) swap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-[currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)-swaps.asp). Points can be calculated and transactions executed for any date that is a valid business day in both currencies. The most commonly traded forward currencies are the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound, and the Swiss franc.

[Forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) are most commonly done for periods of up to one year. Prices for further out dates are available, but [liquidity]([Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[liquidity](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md).asp) is generally lower. In an [outright [forward foreign exchange](../Financial%20Instruments/Citi-Guide%20to%20Swaps.md) contract](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leadsandlags.asp), one [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) is bought against another for delivery on any date beyond the spot. The price is the [spot rate](../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) plus or minus the forward points to the value date. No money changes hands until the [value date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuedate.asp).

In a foreign exchange swap, a [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) is bought for the near date (usually spot) against another [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md), and the same amount is sold back for the forward date. The rate for the forward leg of the swap is the near-date rate plus or minus the forward points to the far date. Money changes hands on both value dates.

### Important

A [forward contract](.md) is different from a [swap contract](../Financial%20Instruments/Review%20Session%20Notes/Currency%20Swaps.md). In a forward, traders agree to exchange an asset at a future date; in a swap, they exchange the [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) generated by the assets.

### Discount Spreads

In contrast to the forward spread, a [discount spread]([Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discount-spread.asp) is the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) forward points that are subtracted from the [spot rate](../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md), to obtain a [forward rate](.md) for a [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). In the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) markets, forward spreads, or points, are presented as two-way quotes; that is, they have a bid price and an offer price. In a [discount spread](.md), the bid price will be higher than the offer price, while in a premium spread, the bid price will be lower than the offer price.

### Important

[Currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) traders seek to profit from the difference in interest payments from the currencies that they hold.

## Examples of Forward Points

Forward points are often quoted in numbers, such as +13.2 or minus -270.68. These represent 1/10,000, so +13.2 means 0.00132 when added to a [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) spot price.

For example, if the euro can be bought versus the dollar at the rate of 1.1350 for spot, and the forward points are +13.2, the [forward rate](.md) is 1.13632 (or 1.1350 + 0.00132).

Based on this information we can determine that the interest rate in the U.S. is higher than that in the Eurozone. The positive forward points when buying the EUR/USD tell us that the rate goes up the further out into the future we go. This is because the forward points compensate for the difference in [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) between the two currencies.

Expressed a different way, if the euro interest rate is 1% and the U.S. interest rate is 2%, a trader could make a 1% difference by holding U.S. dollars instead of euros. So when exchanging or locking in [currency exchange](Currency%20Swap%20Basics.md) rates for the future ([forward rate](.md)) this needs to be factored in.

## What Do Swap Points Tell You?

Swap points reflect the expected interest rate on a [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) swap. Positive swap points indicate that a trader will earn interest on the sold [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md), while [negative interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Negative%20Rates%20and%20Qe%20in%20Europe%20and%20Japan.md) mean that they will owe interest.

## What Is the Difference Between a Swap and a Forward?

[Forwards]([Forwards%20and%20Futures)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp) and swaps are both derivative instruments based on the price of an [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). The difference is that a [forward contract](.md) entails the delivery of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) at a future date, while a [swap contract](../Financial%20Instruments/Review%20Session%20Notes/Currency%20Swaps.md) only transfers the interest payments from the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md).

## How Do You Calculate the Forward Rate of a Bond?

The [forward rate](.md) on a bond is based on the [difference in interest](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/043015/how-do-i-convert-spot-rate-forward-rate.asp) on the spot rates for bonds of different maturities. It is calculated by dividing the interest rate of the longer-term bond by that of the shorter-term one, and subtracting one from the result.

## The Bottom Line

Forward points, or swap points, measure the difference between the current spot price of a [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) pair and the price when the deal matures. If forward points are added, the trader expects to earn interest; if they are subtracted, the trader expects to pay interest.
