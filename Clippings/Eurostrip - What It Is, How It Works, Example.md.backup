## What Is a Eurostrip?

A eurostrip, short for "[eurodollar futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Convexity-Adjusted%20Models%20for%20LIBOR%20Forwards%20Qu.md) strip," is a type of [interest rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) derivative that allows the holder to hedge against changes in [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md). It consists of buying a series of three-month [futures contracts](../Financial%20Engineering/Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) known as [eurodollars](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eurodollar.asp). Therefore, if a [trader](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp) wishes to hedge their risk for one year, they would buy four consecutive eurodollar contracts, each lasting for three months.

### Key Takeaways

- Eurostrips are a popular derivative transaction.
- They consist of a series, or "strip," of consecutive [eurodollar futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Convexity-Adjusted%20Models%20for%20LIBOR%20Forwards%20Qu.md) contracts.
- Although they are mainly used to hedge [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) risk, eurostrips are also used by traders who wish to speculate on interest rate movements.

## Understanding Eurostrips

Eurostrips are a colloquial name used by [derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp) traders to refer to a series of transactions involving eurodollar [futures contracts]([Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp). Eurodollars are essentially U.S. dollar-denominated deposits held at foreign banks or at U.S. banks' overseas branches.

As is so often the case in modern finance, there exists an active derivative market based on these [eurodollar deposits](../International%20Finance/Characteristics%20of%20the%20Eurodollar%20Market.md). Specifically, ever since 1981, the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cme.asp) has facilitated trading in [eurodollar deposits](../International%20Finance/Characteristics%20of%20the%20Eurodollar%20Market.md) using [cash-settled](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashsettlement.asp) [eurodollar futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Convexity-Adjusted%20Models%20for%20LIBOR%20Forwards%20Qu.md) contracts.

These contracts have as their [underlying asset]([Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying.asp) [eurodollar deposits](../International%20Finance/Characteristics%20of%20the%20Eurodollar%20Market.md) with principal values of $1 million and maturity periods of three months. The value of these [futures contracts](../Financial%20Engineering/Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) fluctuates based on the three-month U.S. dollar [London Interbank Offered Rate]([Short-Term%20Rates%20and%20the%20Transition%20from%20LIBOR) (LIBOR)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp). Therefore, traders can use [eurodollar futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Convexity-Adjusted%20Models%20for%20LIBOR%20Forwards%20Qu.md) to hedge against or speculate on changes to [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).

### Important

The Intercontinental Exchange, the authority responsible for LIBOR, will stop publishing one-week and two-month USD LIBOR after Dec. 31, 2021. All other LIBOR will be discontinued after June 30, 2023.

Eurostrips are a derivative transaction in which the trader purchases a series of back-to-back [eurodollar futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Convexity-Adjusted%20Models%20for%20LIBOR%20Forwards%20Qu.md) contracts. The length of the chain will vary depending on the trader's intentions. For instance, a trader wishing to [hedge or speculate](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-[hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)-and-speculation/) one year into the future would construct a eurostrip based on four [eurodollar futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Convexity-Adjusted%20Models%20for%20LIBOR%20Forwards%20Qu.md) (three months each, 12 months in total), a trader looking six months ahead would buy two [futures contracts](../Financial%20Engineering/Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md), and so on.

The end result of [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) using eurostrips is the same as that of using [interest rate swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp), but the two contracts are traded differently and have a different set of cash flows. One choice may be more desirable than another at a given time to meet a specific [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) objective, or both may be used together. Eurostrips are popular because of their flexibility to be structured in many different ways to meet a variety of [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) needs.

Although eurostrips are most commonly used to hedge interest rate risks, they can also be used to speculate on LIBOR or on the shape of the [interest rate term structure]([Valuing%20Interest%20Rate%20Caps%20and%20Floors%20Using%20QuantLib%20Python)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termstructure.asp).

## Real World Example of a Eurostrip

To illustrate, suppose you operate a global [investment]([An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer) bank](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/[investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)-[banking](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md).asp) based in Paris, which holds U.S. dollar deposits in its European branches. You are unsure about the future direction of [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and are therefore eager to hedge against the foreign exchange risk associated with these dollar holdings.

To hedge against this risk, you create a eurostrip position by taking a [long position]([Chapter%204%20-%20Futures:%20Hedging%20and%20Speculation)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) in four consecutive [eurodollar futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Convexity-Adjusted%20Models%20for%20LIBOR%20Forwards%20Qu.md) contracts. Because each contract lasts for three months, this eurostrip position effectively hedges your [interest rate exposure](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2013%20-%20Banks%20Asset-Liability%20Management/Duration%20Gap%20Management.md) for one year.
