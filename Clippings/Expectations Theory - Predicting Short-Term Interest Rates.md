## What Is Expectations Theory?

[Expectations theory](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates.md) attempts to predict what short-term [interest rates]([Interest%20Rate%20Quotations)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) will be in the future based on current [long-term interest rates](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/The%20Economist%20Margin%20Call%20of%20the%20Wild.md). The theory suggests that an investor earns the same interest by investing in two consecutive one-year bond investments versus investing in one two-year bond today. The theory is also known as the "unbiased [expectations theory](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates.md)."

## Understanding Expectations Theory

The [expectations theory](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates.md) aims to help [investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) make decisions based on a forecast of future [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md). The theory uses long-term rates, typically from government bonds, to forecast the rate for short-term bonds. In theory, long-term rates can be used to indicate where rates of short-term bonds will trade in the future.

### Calculating Expectations Theory

Let's say that the present [bond market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondmarket.asp) provides investors with a two-year bond that pays an interest rate of 20% while a one-year bond pays an interest rate of 18%. The [expectations theory](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates.md) can be used to forecast the interest rate of a future one-year bond.

- The first step of the calculation is to add one to the two-year bond’s interest rate. The result is 1.2.
- The next step is to square the result or (1.2 \* 1.2 = 1.44).
- Divide the result by the current one-year interest rate and add one or ((1.44 / 1.18) +1 = 1.22).
- To calculate the forecasted one-year bond interest rate for the following year, subtract one from the result or (1.22 -1 = 0.22 or 22%).

In this example, the investor is earning an equivalent return to the present interest rate of a two-year bond. If the investor chooses to invest in a one-year bond at 18%, the bond yield for the following year’s bond would need to increase to 22% for this [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) to be advantageous.

## Disadvantages of Expectations Theory

Investors should be aware that the [expectations theory](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates.md) is not always a reliable tool. A common problem with using the [expectations theory](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates.md) is that it sometimes overestimates future [short-term rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%208/Volatility%20and%20Convexity.md), making it easy for investors to end up with an inaccurate prediction of a bond’s [yield curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldcurve.asp).

Another limitation of the theory is that many factors impact short-term and long-term bond yields. The Federal Reserve adjusts [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) up or down, which impacts bond yields, including short-term bonds. However, long-term yields might be less affected because many other factors impact long-term yields, including [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and economic growth [expectations](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md).

As a result, the [expectations theory](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates.md) does not consider the outside forces and fundamental macroeconomic factors that drive [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and, ultimately, bond yields.

## Expectations Theory vs. Preferred Habitat Theory

The preferred habitat theory takes the [expectations theory](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates.md) one step further. The theory states that investors have a [preference](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Utility%20Indices.md) for short-term bonds over long-term bonds unless the latter pay a [risk premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskpremium.asp). In other words, if investors are going to hold onto a long-term bond, they want to be compensated with a higher [yield](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield.asp) to justify the risk of holding the [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) until [maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp).

The preferred habitat theory can help explain, in part, why longer-term bonds typically pay out a higher interest rate than two shorter-term bonds that, when added together, result in the same maturity.

When comparing the [preferred habitat theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferred-habitat-theory.asp) to the [expectations theory](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates.md), the difference is that the former assumes investors are concerned with maturity as well as yield. In contrast, the [expectations theory](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates.md) assumes that investors are only concerned with yield.

## What Is the Formula for Expectations Theory?

(1+X%)\*(1+X%)\*(1+X%) = (1+Y%)\*(1+x)\*(1+x)

  

X = multiple-year bond interest rate

Y = one-year bond interest rate

## What Are the Types of Expectations Theory?

There are three types, including Preferred Habitat theory, [Liquidity](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) [Preference theory](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Consumption%20Plans%20and%20Preference%20Relations.md), and Pure [Expectations theory](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates.md).

## How Accurate Is Expectations Theory?

[Expectations theory](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates.md) is largely based on a formula and several assumptions, which means there is a lot of potential for miscalculations and other errors. When making investing decisions, take many factors into account.

## The Bottom Line

[Expectations theory](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates.md) aims to help investors make decisions by using long-term rates, typically from government bonds, to forecast the rate for short-term bonds. Though useful, investors should keep in mind that this theory is not always accurate due to overestimation or oversimplification.
