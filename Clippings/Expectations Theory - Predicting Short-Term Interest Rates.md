## What Is Expectations Theory?

[[Teaching Note 3 Understanding The Term Structure Of Interest Rates|Expectations theory]] attempts to predict what short-term [[[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) will be in the future based on current [[The Economist Margin Call of the Wild|long-term interest rates]]. The theory suggests that an investor earns the same interest by investing in two consecutive one-year bond investments versus investing in one two-year bond today. The theory is also known as the "unbiased [[Teaching Note 3 Understanding The Term Structure Of Interest Rates|expectations theory]]."

### Key Takeaways

- [[Teaching Note 3 Understanding The Term Structure Of Interest Rates|Expectations theory]] predicts future short-term [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] based on current [[The Economist Margin Call of the Wild|long-term interest rates]]
- The theory suggests that an investor earns the same amount of interest by investing in two consecutive one-year bond investments versus investing in one two-year bond today
- In theory, long-term rates can be used to indicate where rates of short-term bonds will trade in the future

## Understanding Expectations Theory

The [[Teaching Note 3 Understanding The Term Structure Of Interest Rates|expectations theory]] aims to help [investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) make decisions based on a forecast of future [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]]. The theory uses long-term rates, typically from government bonds, to forecast the rate for short-term bonds. In theory, long-term rates can be used to indicate where rates of short-term bonds will trade in the future.

### Calculating Expectations Theory

Let's say that the present [bond market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondmarket.asp) provides investors with a two-year bond that pays an interest rate of 20% while a one-year bond pays an interest rate of 18%. The [[Teaching Note 3 Understanding The Term Structure Of Interest Rates|expectations theory]] can be used to forecast the interest rate of a future one-year bond.

- The first step of the calculation is to add one to the two-year bond’s interest rate. The result is 1.2.
- The next step is to square the result or (1.2 \* 1.2 = 1.44).
- Divide the result by the current one-year interest rate and add one or ((1.44 / 1.18) +1 = 1.22).
- To calculate the forecasted one-year bond interest rate for the following year, subtract one from the result or (1.22 -1 = 0.22 or 22%).

In this example, the investor is earning an equivalent return to the present interest rate of a two-year bond. If the investor chooses to invest in a one-year bond at 18%, the bond yield for the following year’s bond would need to increase to 22% for this [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] to be advantageous.

## Disadvantages of Expectations Theory

Investors should be aware that the [[Teaching Note 3 Understanding The Term Structure Of Interest Rates|expectations theory]] is not always a reliable tool. A common problem with using the [[Teaching Note 3 Understanding The Term Structure Of Interest Rates|expectations theory]] is that it sometimes overestimates future [[Volatility and Convexity|short-term rates]], making it easy for investors to end up with an inaccurate prediction of a bond’s [yield curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldcurve.asp).

Another limitation of the theory is that many factors impact short-term and long-term bond yields. The Federal Reserve adjusts [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] up or down, which impacts bond yields, including short-term bonds. However, long-term yields might be less affected because many other factors impact long-term yields, including [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] and economic growth [[FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE|expectations]].

As a result, the [[Teaching Note 3 Understanding The Term Structure Of Interest Rates|expectations theory]] does not consider the outside forces and fundamental macroeconomic factors that drive [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] and, ultimately, bond yields.

## Expectations Theory vs. Preferred Habitat Theory

The preferred habitat theory takes the [[Teaching Note 3 Understanding The Term Structure Of Interest Rates|expectations theory]] one step further. The theory states that investors have a [[Utility Indices|preference]] for short-term bonds over long-term bonds unless the latter pay a [risk premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskpremium.asp). In other words, if investors are going to hold onto a long-term bond, they want to be compensated with a higher [yield](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield.asp) to justify the risk of holding the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] until [maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp).

The preferred habitat theory can help explain, in part, why longer-term bonds typically pay out a higher interest rate than two shorter-term bonds that, when added together, result in the same maturity.

When comparing the [preferred habitat theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferred-habitat-theory.asp) to the [[Teaching Note 3 Understanding The Term Structure Of Interest Rates|expectations theory]], the difference is that the former assumes investors are concerned with maturity as well as yield. In contrast, the [[Teaching Note 3 Understanding The Term Structure Of Interest Rates|expectations theory]] assumes that investors are only concerned with yield.

## What Is the Formula for Expectations Theory?

(1+X%)\*(1+X%)\*(1+X%) = (1+Y%)\*(1+x)\*(1+x)

  

X = multiple-year bond interest rate

Y = one-year bond interest rate

## What Are the Types of Expectations Theory?

There are three types, including Preferred Habitat theory, [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|Liquidity]] [[Consumption Plans and Preference Relations|Preference theory]], and Pure [[Teaching Note 3 Understanding The Term Structure Of Interest Rates|Expectations theory]].

## How Accurate Is Expectations Theory?

[[Teaching Note 3 Understanding The Term Structure Of Interest Rates|Expectations theory]] is largely based on a formula and several assumptions, which means there is a lot of potential for miscalculations and other errors. When making investing decisions, take many factors into account.

## The Bottom Line

[[Teaching Note 3 Understanding The Term Structure Of Interest Rates|Expectations theory]] aims to help investors make decisions by using long-term rates, typically from government bonds, to forecast the rate for short-term bonds. Though useful, investors should keep in mind that this theory is not always accurate due to overestimation or oversimplification.
