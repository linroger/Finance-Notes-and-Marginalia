# Lecture 8- Inflation & Sovereign Default Risk
  
So far we have discussed [Portfolio](Lecture%205-%20Dynamic%20[[An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer) Choice|[portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) choice]] in terms of nominal [returns](Assets.md). This means, we have not taken into account the loss of purchasing power that an investor may experience over time due to [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). The loss of purchasing power that a long-term investor experiences over time can be substantial even with moderate [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates. From a [Portfolio](Lecture%205-%20Dynamic%20[[An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer) Choice|[portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) choice]] viewpoint, the key question is whether the risk of such loss of purchasing power can be altered by choosing an appropriate asset mix in the [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md).
  
### 8.1 Nominal and real returns
  
If we measure purchasing power with the [consumer price index](Pricing an Inflation Swap.md) (CPI), the [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rate is
  $$
\begin{equation*}
\Pi_{t+1}=\frac{C P I_{t+1}}{C P I_{t}}-1 \tag{8.1}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
The [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rate based on the CPI does not necessarily provide the correct measurement of the loss of purchasing power of a dollar that an investor experiences. A price index is a weighted average of the prices of a huge number of individual goods and services. The weighting of these goods and services in the CPI is meant to be appropriate for a representative consumer, but in practice different consumers will have different weights of goods and services in their personal consumption baskets. There are also different official price indices, constructed for different purposes, that use different weights, such as the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, or the GDP deflator that is used to estimate the real gross domestic product. We won't go into the details here of how one could better measure an investor's loss of purchasing power and we'll just assume that the CPI is a good proxy to measure investors' loss of purchasing power due to [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md).

Consider an asset with nominal return $R_{t}$. Then the real return of an asset, after adjusting for the loss of purchasing power, is
  $$
\begin{equation*}
R_{t}^{r}=\left(1+R_{t}\right) /\left(1+\Pi_{t}\right)-1 \approx R_{t}-\Pi_{t} \tag{8.2}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
For some investors, focusing on optimizing nominal [returns](Assets.md) may be fine. For example, many insurance companies have liabilities that are largely fixed in nominal terms. They then try to match these nominal liabilities with assets that deliver payoffs fixed in nominal terms. For others, such as investors saving for retirement who care about the purchasing power that they will have in retirement, the focus should be on optimizing real [returns](Assets.md). For some investors the objective may be mixed. For example, many public pension funds have pension liabilities that are partially indexed to [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). The final salaries that determine benefit levels of future retirees tend to grow with [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md), but the payments to existing retirees are often only partially indexed to [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md).
  
In the rest of this lecture, we will take the perspective of an investor who cares about real [returns](Assets.md) and wants to optimize [risk and return](Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds.md) in real terms.
  
At long horizons, the difference between nominal and real [returns](Assets.md) can be huge. Figure 8.1 shows the history of CPI [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) in the U.S. during the post world war II period, measured as the percentage change in CPI over 12-month intervals. Investors in the 1970s and 1980s experienced [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates above $10 \%$. These [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates could turn
 ![500](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_19_48a1c4654e845915c45cg-269.jpg?height=936&width=1199&top_left_y=296&top_left_x=474)
  
Figure 8.2: Final values in real and nominal terms of a 20-year long [investment](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) in a [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) of U.S. Treasury bonds with 5-10 year maturity
a $10 \%$ yield on a Treasury bond into a zero return in real terms. Over the subsequent decades, [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates fell to much lower levels and were more stable. Only very recently, in the wake of the COVID pandemic, [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) started rising again to levels we had not seen since the early 1980s.
  
Figure 8.2 illustrates the consequences that [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) had for the experiences of longterm bond investors during the past decades. In this figure, I consider an investor who invests 1$ to purchase a [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) of 5-10 year U.S. Treasury bonds and rebalances this [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) every month so that it stays within the 5-10 year maturity band. The investor does this rebalancing for 20 years and I then look at the final value of the [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) after 20 years in nominal terms and in real terms. The bonds in this [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) are regular U.S. Treasury bonds that have principal and coupons fixed in nominal terms (we'll discuss a different kind that offers [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md)-adjusted payoffs later in this lecture).
  
The blue line in the figure shows the nominal final value. For example, the point on the blue line for 1975 says that an investor who held this bond [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) from 1956 to 1975 turned the initial 1$ into around 2.1$. The real line shows the real value, after removing the effects of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). The point for 1975 on the red line therefore says that in terms of purchasing power, the investor who started in 1956 just achieved a preservation of the purchasing power of his [investment](An Asset Allocation Primer.md), but not more than this: the real return was zero.

Investors who started a little later, say in 1963 and held the [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) until 1982, experienced a loss of purchasing power of about $10 \%$, even though in nominal terms their [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) more than doubled.
  
Investors who started in the mid-1970s and held the [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) until 1995 had an initially terrible experience in real terms. However, due to bond yields coming down in the second half of the 1980s and the 1990s, and hence increasing bond prices, these investors also benefited from a huge nominal return on their bond holdings. Since [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates had come down at that time, too, this also meant a high real return. So overall, while there is a huge gap from real [returns](Assets.md) to the huge nominal [returns](Assets.md) of around $700 \%$, by 1995 these investors ended up more than doubling their purchasing power. The low real [returns](Assets.md) in the first half of their 20-year period were more than offset by the high real [returns](Assets.md) in the second half.
  
The [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates above 10\% per year experienced by the U.S. in the 1970s and 1980s were a substantial drag on real [returns](Assets.md) for investors holding securities with nominally fixed payoffs. Investors in other developed countries experienced similar rates of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) around the same time. In Germany [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) peaked at $8 \%$; in the U.K. the peak was at $25 \%$. However, these [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates pale against the [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates that some countries throughout history have experienced during episodes of hyperinflation.
  
Figure 8.5 lists the most extreme hyperinflations in world history as ranked by the maximum monthly [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rate. The record was set in Hungary shortly after the end of the second world war. Around the peak of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md), prices tripled in a single day. Around the peak of the hyperinflation in Germany in 1922/23, it took about four days for prices to double. In each of these cases, owners of assets with nominally fixed payoffs found their wealth completely wiped out. Borrowers with nominally fixed liabilities saw their debts effectively erased in real terms.
  
In present-day developed markets, hyperinflation seems like an extremely remote possibility. But for a cautious long-term investor with a multi-decade horizon, even such extremely low-probability risks perhaps should not be ignored entirely.
  
### 8.2 Nominal and real assets
  
When we discuss the [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk of different types of assets, it's useful to distinguish two extremes: nominal assets and real assets. Not all assets fit clearly into these categories. For example, for stocks and real estate it is, in the end, an empirical question how close they are to being a real or a nominal asset.
  
A nominal asset is one with nominal cash flows that are insensitive to [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md), but the real value of cash flows falls with [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). An example would be a U.S. Treasury bond. Principal and [coupon payments](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) of these bonds are specified in nominal terms. But this could also include assets with risky payoffs, e.g. high-yield [Corporate Bonds](Class Notes 2 – Corporate Bond Contracts.md). High-yield bonds have a relatively high risk of default, which means the owner of the bond will not receive the full amount that the bond promised to pay. But to the extent there is a payoff, it is a payoff that is fixed in nominal terms. It does not get adjusted upwards if [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) happens to be high.
  
A real asset is one with real cash flows that are insensitive to [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md), which means that nominal cash flows must rise with [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). The purchasing power of the assets' cash flows then remains unaffected by [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). An example that gets close to being such a real assets are Treasury [Inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) Protected Securities (TIPS), issued by the U.S. Treasury. We will discuss these in more detail shortly.
  
For some assets, such as regular U.S. Treasury bonds or TIPS it's clear whether they are nominal or real assets. For other assets, it's not obvious. For example, there is a debate whether stocks should be considered real or nominal assets, and to what degree. We will look into this question shortly.
  
But first some thoughts on [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk exposure of these different types of assets. There are two variants of this risk that are likely related, but not quite the same thing:
  
The risk of unexpected realized [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md)
The risk of changing [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) of future [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md)
  
To think through the effects of these risks, let's look at a simple valuation model. Consider first a nominal asset $A$ that delivers one future nominal [cash flow](Preview of the Book.md) $D_{A, t+1}$, with conditional expected value $\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[D_{A, t+1}\right]$. Let $R$ be the appropriate nominal [discount rate](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/PSET%207-%20Kohler.md) for nominal cash flows. Then, the nominal value at $t$ is
  $$
\begin{equation*}
V_{A, t}=\frac{\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[D_{A, t+1}\right]}{1+R} \tag{8.3}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
The price level at $t$ is $C P I_{t}$, and the [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rate of the next period is $\Pi_{t+1}=$ $C P I_{t+1} / C P I_{t}-1$. If the [expected inflation rate](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md) is not zero, investors at $t$ would demand compensation for the expected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) in the form of a higher nominal [discount rate](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/PSET%207-%20Kohler.md). If investors require a real [expected return](Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) of $R^{r}$ from asset $A$, then they discount nominal cash flows with the nominal rate that is the real rate required by investors adjusted for the [expected inflation rate](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md), i.e.,
  $$
\begin{equation*}
R=\left(1+R^{r}\right)\left(1+\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\Pi_{t+1}\right]\right)-1 \tag{8.4}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
So then we have a nominal value of ${ }^{1}$
  $$
\begin{equation*}
V_{A, t}=\frac{\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[D_{A, t+1}\right]}{\left(1+R^{r}\right)\left(1+\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\Pi_{t+1}\right]\right)} \tag{8.5}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
The real value is
  $$
\begin{equation*}
V_{A, t}^{r}=\frac{C P I_{\text {base }}}{C P I_{t}} \frac{\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[D_{A, t+1}\right]}{\left(1+R^{r}\right)\left(1+\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\Pi_{t+1}\right]\right)}, \tag{8.6}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
where we expressed the real value in terms of dollars as of some base year in which the CPI level was $C P I_{\text {base }}$.
  
Now consider the effects of an unexpected sudden increase in the level of the $C P I_{t}$, i.e., unexpected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). This does not change the [discount rate](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/PSET%207-%20Kohler.md) and, since the asset is a nominal asset, it does not change the expected nominal [cash flow](Preview of the Book.md), but it lowers the real value of this expected [cash flow](Preview of the Book.md) $\frac{C P I_{\text {base }}}{C P I_{t}} \mathbb{E}_{t}\left[D_{A, t+1}\right]$. As a consequence, $V_{A, t}^{r}$ falls. This [^35]reflects the unexpected loss of purchasing power. A nominal asset does not protect the investors against such loss of purchasing power.
  
If the [expected inflation rate](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md) increases, then the [discount rate](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/PSET%207-%20Kohler.md) $\left(1+R^{r}\right)\left(1+\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\Pi_{t+1}\right]\right)$ in the denominator rises, which also leads to a fall in $V_{A, t}^{r}$. If [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) subsequently sticks to the expected path, then investors who buy the asset after expected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) went up will be appropriately compensated by a higher nominal rate of return for the loss of purchasing power. But investors who already hold the asset when the rise in expected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) occurs suffer a loss in terms of real value.
  
So rises in unexpected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) and in expected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) both lower the real value of a nominal asset. In practice, it's likely that the two types of risk at least partly show up at the same time. When newly released [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) number comes in higher than expected, it's also likely that investors will update their [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) of future [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) in the same direction. But this is not always the case, and it's not always the case to the same degree. More on this later.
  
Now what about real assets? Consider a real asset $B$. A real asset would have nominal cash flows that grow one for one with [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). For example, it seems a reasonable conjecture that for companies in many industries revenues, wages, other costs, and hence also profits all grow approximately one-of-one with [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). If so, we would have
  $$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[D_{B, t+1}\right]=\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[D_{B, t+1}^{r} \frac{\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[C P I_{t+1}\right]}{C P I_{\text {base }}}\right. \tag{8.7}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
where I assumed that now the real [cash flow](Preview of the Book.md) $D_{t+1}^{r}$ (rather than the nominal c.f.) is insensitive to changing [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). The real value is expressed in terms of the purchasing power of dollars at time of a base year in which the CPI was at level $C P I_{\text {base }}$. The nominal value therefore grows with [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md)
  $$
\begin{align*}
V_{B, t} & =\frac{\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[D_{B, t+1}^{r}\right]}{\left(1+R^{r}\right)\left(1+\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\Pi_{t+1}\right]\right)} \frac{\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[C P I_{t+1}\right]}{C P I_{\text {base }}}  \tag{8.8}\\
& =\underbrace{\frac{\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[D_{B, t+1}^{r}\right]}{1+R^{r}}}_{\text {Real value }} \frac{C P I_{t}}{C P I_{\text {base }}}, \tag{8.9}
\end{align*}
$$
  
while the real value
  $$
\begin{equation*}
V_{B, t}^{r}=\frac{\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[D_{B, t+1}^{r}\right]}{1+R^{r}} \tag{8.10}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
is immune to [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk. An unexpected sudden increase in the level of the $C P I_{t}$, i.e., unexpected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md), has no effect on the real value of this real asset because any increase in the CPI is matched one-for-one by the same percentage increase in the expected
nominal [cash flow](Preview of the Book.md). A rise in expected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) leaves the real value of this real asset unchanged because an increase in expected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) is compensated by an increase in expected nominal [cash flow](Preview of the Book.md).
  
### 8.3 Inflation risk and hedging
  
Let's now look at data on several asset classes to see whether the properties of [returns](Assets.md) of these assets are more in line with being a nominal or real asset. Are their real [returns](Assets.md) immune to the two types of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risks that we discussed above, or are they exposed?
  
To check this empirically, I construct measures of unexpected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) and of changes in expected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). This requires a measure of expected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). While there is no single best measure of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md), and people may of course disagree about the [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) outlook, the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) is a good starting point. This is a quarterly survey that asks professional macroeconomic forecasters at [financial institutions](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) and other organizations for their forecasts for [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) and other macroeconomic variables. It is currently administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Historical SPF data is available for more than 50 years.
  
Each month, I look at the most recent quarterly SPF and I use the forecasters' median forecast of the [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rate over the next 12 months from end of month $t$ to end of month $t+12, \mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\Pi_{t: t+12}\right]$, and I compare it with the actually realized [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rate over this period, $\Pi_{t: t+12}$ to construct a series of unexpected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md):
  $$
\begin{equation*}
U E_{t: t+12}=\Pi_{t: t+12}-\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\Pi_{t: t+12}\right] \tag{8.11}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
I also construct a series of 12-month changes in [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md)
  $$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta E_{t: t+12}=\mathbb{E}_{t+12}\left[\Pi_{t+12: t+24}\right]-\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\Pi_{t: t+12}\right] \tag{8.12}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
For each asset class, I then construct realized real [returns](Assets.md) over 12-month periods by using the commonly used approximation ${ }^{2}$
  $$
\begin{equation*}
R_{t: t+12}^{r} \approx R_{t: t+12}-\Pi_{t: t+12} \tag{8.13}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
[^36]To estimate each asset classes' exposure to [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk, I then regress these real [returns](Assets.md) on unexpected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) and changes in expected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) ${ }^{3}$
  $$
\begin{equation*}
R_{t: t+12}^{r}=a+\beta_{\pi} U E_{t: t+12}+\beta_{\mathbb{E} \pi} \Delta E_{t: t+12}+e_{t: t+12} \tag{8.14}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
The two slope coefficients $\beta_{\pi}$ and $\beta_{\mathbb{E} \pi}$ capture exposure to the two types of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk. For a real asset with zero exposure to [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk, we would expect $\beta_{\pi}=0$ and $\beta_{\mathbb{E} \pi}=0$. For a nominal asset we would expect $\beta_{\pi}<0$ and $\beta_{\mathbb{E} \pi}<0$.

![400](Keep%20It%202024-10-24%2010.52.14.png)
Table (8.1) shows the results from these regressions for three asset classes: U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 5 to 10 years, the CRSP value-weighted [stock market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) index, and gold. The data is from 1971 to 2023. The results in the table show stark differences across asset classes.
  
Real [returns](Assets.md) of long-term bonds have strong exposure to [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risks. A one percentage point higher unexpected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) is associated with 2.39 percentage points lower real return during the same period. A one percentage point rise in one-year [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) is associated with 2.29 percentage points lower long-term bond [returns](Assets.md)! A rise in [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) is terrible news for nominal long-term bond holders. The $R^{2}$ of this regression of $49 \%$ also highlights that unexpected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) shocks and changes in [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) together explain a large share of variation
  
[^37]in long-term bond [returns](Assets.md). These were the key macro factors for long-term bond [returns](Assets.md) over the past five decades.
  
For the [stock market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) index in Panel B the picture is more mixed. On the one hand, the estimated [regression coefficients](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/A%20Practical%20Estimation%20Method.md) have the same direction as those for long-term bonds in Panel A, and the coefficient on unexpected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) has a similar magnitude. On the other hand, the fact that the absolute value of the $t$-statistics are much smaller than the conventional statistical significance threshold of 1.96 highlights that the true coefficients could perhaps also be zero or somewhat positive. The coefficient on shocks to expected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) is very close to zero. The much lower $R^{2}$ than in Panel A further shows that [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risks just aren't a huge influence on stock [returns](Assets.md). So there are some hints here that we could perhaps indeed view stocks as a real asset that is largely immune to [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risks. But the picture is not entirely clear.
  
Panel C shows the results for gold. Gold has a positive exposure to both [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [risk factors](../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/PSET%206-%20Financial%20Instruments.md). The $t$-statistics are both smaller than the usual threshold of 1.96, but the one on the expected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) variable is very close and indicates significance at least at a $10 \%$ level. So there are some hints that gold not only provides real [returns](Assets.md) protected from [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk, but in addition, its real [returns](Assets.md) may have positive exposure to [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [risk factors](../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/PSET%206-%20Financial%20Instruments.md), so that real [returns](Assets.md) are actually higher when [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) surges and lower when [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) declines. This may reflect that investors are willing to pay an extra insurance premium for real assets, or equivalently, tolerate a relatively low [expected return](Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md), as a price of enjoying [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) protection when [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) surges.
  
Figure 8.4 illustrates the relationship of Treasury bond [returns](Assets.md) and gold [returns](Assets.md) to unexpected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) in a bit more detail. The $x$-axis of these scatterplot shows the unexpected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) realization $U E_{t: t+12}$ and the $y$-axis shows the real return. Interestingly, the relationships seem to be somewhat nonlinear, with bond [returns](Assets.md) particularly sensitive to unexpectedly low [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) and gold [returns](Assets.md) particularly sensitive to unexpectedly high [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). When [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) surprised investors on the low side during the past 50 years, bonds earned big [returns](Assets.md); when [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) surprised on the upside, gold prices rocketed. (For the [stock market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) index, a similar scatterplot just shows a cloud without any clear relationship, so I did not add this plot.)
  
A few more thoughts on the question whether we should think of stocks as a real asset, and the somewhat mixed picture on this from Table (8.1). Part of the reason why the picture is mixed could be that the regression in Table (8.1) does not isolate pure [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk exposure. In the historical data, bursts of unexpected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md), or changes in expected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md), may have coincided with other macroeconomic news, e.g., about growth, that affected investors' [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) of real cash flows. For example, the stagflation episodes of the early 1980s may have led investors to believe that an unexpected rise in [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) will be countered by a recession-inducing and stock-price-

University of St. Gallen, School of Finance Research Paper.
depressing hike in [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) by the Federal Reserve. This may have contributed to the negative relationship between real [stock market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) [returns](Assets.md) and unexpected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). The potential presence of such confounding factors makes it difficult to cleanly isolate the pure [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk exposure effect from the data.
  
One way of doing so is to look at episodes where the [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) shock was just so big that alternative confounding factors are just far too small in comparison to distort the picture. For example, we can ask how well stocks performed during episodes of hyperinflation. Did stock prices rise roughly in line with the CPI as one would expect for a real asset or did a [stock market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) investor experience a substantial loss in purchasing power?
  
Figure 8.5 presents evidence from the German hyperinflation during the 1920s. The authors of this study hand-collected data on stock prices of several hundred stocks listed
on the Berlin stock exchange. The time series shown in the chart cover the period from start of 1920 until September 1923 during which the CPI in Germany (red solid line) rose by a bit less than 10 million times. As the figure shows, stock prices (blue solid line) rose largely in lockstep by the same factor. In contrast, nominal long-term bonds (4.5\% Deutsche Reichsschatzanweisung) of course did not rise at all and hence owners of these bonds basically experienced a total loss in real terms.
  
The last two months until the peak and end of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) in November 1923 are missing in the authors' data (during these two months prices increased by a factor of 1000), but other studies have data that suggests that the stocks in Germany maintained much of their real value during these two months and the following [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) reform. ${ }^{4}$
  
Overall, data from this hyperinflation episode provides strong support to the notion that stocks are a real asset and that stockholders' real wealth is largely protected against extreme rises in [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). (That said, if hyperinflation were to trigger social unrest, revolution and expropriation, then stockholders would lose nevertheless.)
### 8.4 Inflation-protected bonds
While stocks may provide some protection from [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risks, stocks of course are exposed to many other macroeconomic [risk factors](../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/PSET%206-%20Financial%20Instruments.md). A risk averse investor seeking [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) protection may prefer a bond-like [investment](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) that offers coupons and principal that are fixed in real terms rather than uncertain. In many countries, such [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md)-protected bonds are now available. The U.S. Treasury started issuing Treasury [Inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) Protected Securities (TIPS) in 1997. The British government has issued [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md)-protected bonds since 1981 .
  
Here is how TIPS work. Coupon and principal of TIPS are not fixed in nominal terms, but they grow with the CPI, as measured by the CPI three months before the coupon or principal payment date. For example, suppose a 10-year TIPS is issued at the end of month $t$ with a 10-year maturity. For simplicity, suppose the principal value is 1$ and the coupon payments occur every 12 months (instead of the actual semi-annual payment frequency) at a coupon rate of $c^{r} \%$. This coupon rate specified in the terms of TIPS is a real coupon rate. Then the first coupon payment in month $t+12$ in nominal terms will be$$
\begin{equation*}
c^{r} \times $ 1 \times \frac{C P I_{t+9}}{C P I_{t-3}} \tag{8.15}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
[^38]The coupon payment a year later will be
  $$
\begin{equation*}
c^{r} \times $ 1 \times \frac{C P I_{t+21}}{C P I_{t-3}} \tag{8.16}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
and so on, and then the final payment of principal and coupon,
  $$
\begin{equation*}
\left($ 1+c^{r} \times $ 1\right) \times \frac{C P I_{t+117}}{C P I_{t-3}} \tag{8.17}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
This means that at time $t$ the future nominal cash flows of TIPS are uncertain. They depend on the yet-unknown future values of the CPI. But the real cash flows are essentially certain. The reason why I write 'essentially' is that there is a little deviation from truly fixed and certain real [cash flow](Preview of the Book.md) values due to the fact that the indexing is to the CPI three months before and not the CPI during the measurement month. (The reason for this lag is the practical issue that the CPI first needs to be calculated and published before it can be used to adjust coupon and principal payments). Without this imperfection, deflating the coupon and principal payments with the CPI at the time of the payments would lead to real cash flows, expressed in time $t$ dollars, that are $c^{r} \times  1$ before maturity, and $\left( 1+c^{r} \times  1\right)$ at maturity. In the following discussion, we ignore the slight timing mismatch between CPI measurement and payment dates and we assume that TIPS cash flows are fixed and certain in real terms. ${ }^{5}$
  
TIPS are immune to both types of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk we discussed above. If the current CPI unexpectedly goes up by $x \%$, then all future coupons and principal payments will be $x \%$ higher in nominal terms, but in real terms they remain unchanged, hence the real value of TIPS stays unchanged and there is no loss of purchasing power. If current [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) of future [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) go up by $x$ percentage points per year until bond maturity, [coupon payments](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) and the outstanding [principal amount](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/HSBC-Auto%20callable%20Barrier%20Notes%20with%20Step-up%20Premium.md) are expected to grow by an additional $x$ percentage points more per year in nominal terms, but in real terms they will stay the same. Hence, the real value of TIPS stays unchanged and there is no loss of purchasing power.
  
Therefore, the value of TIPS then reflects the fixed real cash flows discounted at a real yield-to-maturity. For example, the 10-year real yield-to-maturity $Y_{10, t}^{r}$ is the real [discount rate](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/PSET%207-%20Kohler.md) that makes the discounted real cash flows of 10-year TIPS equal to the price of 10-year TIPS:
  $$
\begin{equation*}
P_{10, t}=\left(\sum_{k=1}^{10} \frac{c^{r}}{\left(1+Y_{10, t}^{r}\right)^{k}}\right)+\frac{1}{\left(1+Y_{10, t}^{r}\right)^{10}} \tag{8.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 8.6: Real yields extracted from TIPS prices
  
So by observing TIPS prices, we can directly observe real yields! Given $P_{10, t}$, we can extract the real yield $Y_{10, t}^{r}$. We can also do this for other maturities and get a real yield curve.
  
Figure 8.6 shows the real yields extracted from 5- and 10-year TIPS. While real yields were between 1 and 2 percent prior to the Great [Financial Crisis](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) (GFC) in 2008/09, real yields after the GFC spent extended periods of time in negative territory. It is unusual for nominal yields to be negative since investors could also hold money as zero-interest cash instead of bonds. ${ }^{6}$ But there is nothing necessarily unusual about real yields turning negative if the [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rate is above zero. A zero-interest deposit account or holding paper money would also have a negative real return in this case.
  
The figure also shows that the 10-year real yield tends to be above the 5 -year real yield. This suggests that the real yield curve may be upward-sloping on average, like the nominal yield curve. Evidence from the U.K. where a longer history of real yields is available than in the U.S. indicates that the real yield curve may be flatter than the nominal yield curve. How big the wedge is between the slopes may depend on whether we are in an inflationary environment or not. If [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk is high, long-term nominal bonds are risky, as our analysis showed earlier, and so it makes sense that investors would ask for an additional risk premium, in the form of additional yield, for long-term nominal bonds compared with [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md)-protected bonds that are not exposed to [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk.

Figure 8.7: Breakeven [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates extracted from TIPS prices
  
The spike of real yields in Figure 8.6 in [the fall](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Fall%20of%20Bear%20Stearns%20Lost%20Opportunities%20Haunt%20Final%20Days%20of%20Bear%20Stearns;%20Executives%20Bickeredover%20Raising%20Cash%20Cutting%20Mortgages.md) of 2008 highlights a potential problem with TIPS. TIPS are not as liquid as regular Treasury bonds. In [the fall](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Fall%20of%20Bear%20Stearns%20Lost%20Opportunities%20Haunt%20Final%20Days%20of%20Bear%20Stearns;%20Executives%20Bickeredover%20Raising%20Cash%20Cutting%20Mortgages.md) of 2008, some big investors liquidated large positions in TIPS that lead to depressed prices of TIPS and the spike in real yields that we see in the figure. This was a time when the economy entered a deep recession and [the Fed](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) had rapidly lowered short-term [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md). It would be very unusual for [real interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Aggregate%20Production.md) to go up in such an environment. But these real yields from TIPS at the time were distorted due to the price pressure of these liquidations in an illiquid market.
  
The fact that we can back out real yields from TIPS prices brings us to another very useful piece of information we can extract from TIPS and regular Treasury bonds jointly: A measure of expected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md)!
  
The price of 10-year nominal Treasury bond reflects the fixed nominal cash flows discounted at a nominal yield-to-maturity $Y_{10, t}$ :
  $$
\begin{equation*}
P_{10, t}=\left(\sum_{k=1}^{10} \frac{c}{\left(1+Y_{10, t}\right)^{k}}\right)+\frac{1}{\left(1+Y_{10, t}\right)^{10}} \tag{8.19}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
and the difference between the nominal yield extracted from regular Treasury bond prices and the real yield extracted from TIPS is known as breakeven [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md):
  $$
\begin{equation*}
\text { Breakeven inflation }=Y_{10, t}-Y_{10, t}^{r} \tag{8.20}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
It's called breakeven [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) because when [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) is higher than the breakeven [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rate over the time until maturity of the bonds, TIPS will have earned a higher return; if [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) is lower, regular Treasury bonds will have done better.
  
This also shows why we can interpret breakeven [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) as a measure of the [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) that investors must have. When they price TIPS and regular Treasury bonds, they should price them such that both of them are an ex-ante equally attractive investments. The nominal yield on regular Treasury bonds should be the real on TIPS plus the average [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rate that investors expect over the 10 years until the bonds mature.
  
There is one qualification though. While breakeven [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) may be a good approximate measure of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md), they are unlikely to be an exact measure because investors may also demand a risk premium for the [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk of regular Treasury bonds, i.e., the nominal yield has an [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk premium component that real yields of TIPS don't have:
  $$
\begin{equation*}
Y_{10, t}=Y_{10, t}^{r}+\text { expected inflation }+ \text { inflation risk premium } \tag{8.21}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
This means that
  $$
\begin{equation*}
\text { Breakeven inflation }=\text { expected inflation }+ \text { inflation risk premium } \tag{8.22}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
The reason why the [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk premium shows up in breakeven [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) is that nominal Treasury bonds and TIPS are not the same type of asset, so the nominal yield that we compare with a real yield in the calculation of breakeven [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) are yields of two different types of assets that investors consider to be different in terms of their [riskiness](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Preferences.md) with respect to [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md): Nominal bonds are exposed to [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk while TIPS are not. However, empirical estimates suggest that relative to the magnitude of expected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md), the [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk premium is relatively small. So it's not a bad approximation to use breakeven [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) as a proxy for investors' [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md). (Price distortions of TIPS due to illiquidity like in 2008 are a bigger problem).
  
Breakeven [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) has significant advantages compared with survey-based [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) measures. First, it is based on market prices and investors have stronger incentives to get their forecast "right" than the respondents in surveys. Second, breakeven [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) is available at high frequency. Based on TIPS prices, we can therefore observe [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) at daily or even higher frequency. Third, there is a whole [term structure](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) of breakeven [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates based on the outstanding maturities of TIPS. So we can see investors' views about future [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) over short and long horizons.
  
In terms of seeing how investments in TIPS and Treasury bonds perform in a relative comparison, comparing individual bonds directly is somewhat cumbersome because an investor aiming at bond positions within a certain maturity range would typically roll over a [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) of bonds. Conveniently, there are TIPS and Treasury bond ETFs that allow us to track the performance of such regularly rebalanced portfolios easily. I will show data for two ETFs: The Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF (ticker SCHP), one of the largest TIPS ETFs, that holds TIPS with average maturity around 7 years. For comparison, I look at the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF (ticker VGIT), which holds regular Treasury bonds with average maturity around 6 years. We can use the ETF data to study how well a TIPS [investment](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) would have protected a bond investor from the rapid rise in [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) that the U.S. experienced following the COVID pandemic.
  
Figure 8.8a shows the [investment](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) experience in real terms of an investor in the two ETFs. For this analysis, I invest 1$ in each ETF at the beginning in 2010. I then track the value of this investment (with reinvested dividends). Over the entire sample period, the investment in the TIPS ETF grew to slightly less than 1.20$ in real terms (i.e., after deflating by the CPI). In contrast, the [investment](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) in Treasury bonds almost did not grow at all in real terms over the full period. This wedge in performance indicates that over this 12-year period, [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) must have been higher than the [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md), i.e., breakeven [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md), that were priced into the prices of TIPS and regular Treasury bonds initially.
  
The figure also shows that the performance advantage of TIPS started showing up around 2012 and later disappeared, before it reappeared very strongly at the end of the period starting in 2020. Figure 8.8 b shows that this lines up well with the path of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates that realized during these years: Around 2012 there was a strong rise in [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates that subsequently disappered, with [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) falling to very low levels around 2014. And then there was the very strong re-emergence of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) after 2020. Both unexpected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) was high and expected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rose during this period, and both eroded the real value of regular Treasury bonds while the real value of TIPS stayed unaffected.
  
### 8.5 Portfolio optimization in real terms
  
An investor aiming to optimize [risk and return](Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds.md) in terms of the purchasing power that investments eventually provide should optimize the [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) in terms of real [returns](Assets.md). This can still be done with the same [mean-variance](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) optimization framework that we
 ![500](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_19_48a1c4654e845915c45cg-285.jpg?height=1605&width=969&top_left_y=458&top_left_x=600)
  
Figure 8.8: TIPS and regular Treasury Bond ETF cumulative performance
discussed in earlier lectures, but with some modifications. In the following, consider a long-term investor wants to maximize the expected utility of real wealth in $h$ periods by trading off expected real return on wealth against the variance of the real return. Let's assume the investor wants to combine a risky asset with a [risk-free asset](../Financial%20Engineering/2.%20Forwards,%20Swaps,%20Futures,%20and%20Options.md) with a fixed-weight strategy like the one we analyzed in lecture 5 , but now with a focus on real [returns](Assets.md).
  
As in lecture 5 , we will work with $\log$ [returns](Assets.md) here. Let $r_{t}$ be the log nominal return and $\pi_{t}=\log \left(1+\Pi_{t}\right)$ the $\log$ [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rate. Then the log real return is
  $$
\begin{equation*}
r_{t}^{r}=\log \left(\frac{1+R_{t}}{1+\Pi_{t}}\right)=r_{t}-\pi_{t} \tag{8.23}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
In our analysis, we will also need the log real yield of TIPS, which is, for TIPS with maturity $n$,
  $$
\begin{equation*}
y_{n, t}^{r}=\log \left(1+Y_{n, t}^{r}\right) \tag{8.24}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
More precisely, assume that this log real yield $y_{n, t}^{r}$ is a zero-coupon log real yield extracted from the prices of TIPS.
  
Recall that in lecture 5 the solution to the optimal [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) problem for the fixedweight strategy and horizon $h$ was
  $$
\begin{equation*}
\omega=\frac{\mathbb{E}\left[r_{t+1}\right]-r_{f}+\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{var}\left(r_{t: t+h}\right) / h}{\gamma \operatorname{var}\left(r_{t: t+h}\right) / h} \tag{8.25}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
where $r_{f}$ was a nominal [risk-free rate](Black Scholes Derivation.md) and $\operatorname{var}\left(r_{t: t+h}\right)$ was the variance of the longterm log [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) return, also in nominal terms. The investor then needs make several adjustments to our approach in lecture 5 to do the optimization in real terms.
  
The first adjustment concerns the [risk-free rate](Black Scholes Derivation.md) to be used. When the investor cares about real, not nominal [returns](Assets.md), a nominally [risk-free asset](../Financial%20Engineering/2.%20Forwards,%20Swaps,%20Futures,%20and%20Options.md) like Treasury bond is not risk-free in real terms. In the presence of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk, the real return on Treasury bonds is uncertain, even if the maturity of the bond exactly matches the optimization horizon. Instead, for the investor with a $h$-year horizon, TIPS with $h$ years of remaining maturity would be virtually risk-free and hence the real yield of these securities can then be used as the real [risk-free rate](Black Scholes Derivation.md) over this horizon. Now, as TIPS pay coupons semi-annually and hence TIPS with $h$ years of remaining to maturity are not exactly a $T$-year zero-coupon bond, which creates a slight mismatch with the optimization horizon of $h$ years. So let's assume the investor can invest in a real zero-coupon bond that offers a log real yield of $y_{h, t}^{r}$ with maturity $h$ matched to the investor's horizon. This is the [risk-free asset](../Financial%20Engineering/2.%20Forwards,%20Swaps,%20Futures,%20and%20Options.md) for this investor and $y_{h, t}^{r}$ should therefore replace $r_{f}$ in (8.25).

Figure 8.9: Treasury bill yields and [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md)
  
There is a potential alternative to using TIPS yields: A strategy of rolling over an [investment](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) in short-term T-bills (say, 3-month T-bills) over a longer horizon is not as low risk in real terms as a TIPS [investment](An Asset Allocation Primer.md), but it actually gets quite close. As we discussed in the last lecture, the Federal Reserve tends to raise short-term [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) if it sees [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rise. As a consequence, when [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rises, an [investment](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) in a 3-month T-bill will initially suffer a loss of real value when [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rises after the T-bill was purchased, but already in the next quarter, the yields on T-bills may have gone up to compensate for the higher [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rate. As a consequence, the real loss of wealth remains small. Figure 8.9 shows the strong comovement of 3 -month T-bill yields and [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) in most of the previous decades. The most recent years since the onset of the COVID pandemic have been somewhat of an exception: Here the Federal Reserve was unusually slow in responding to the rise in [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) with raising short-term [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md). To the extent one accepts the rolling-over-T-bills strategy as safe in real terms, one can use the average historical real return of this strategy as a proxy for $y_{h, t}^{r}$.
  
The optimal [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) share for the investor concerned about [risk and return](Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds.md) in real terms then is
  $$
\begin{equation*}
\omega=\frac{\mathbb{E}\left[r_{t+1}^{r}\right]-y_{h, t}^{r}+\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{var}\left(r_{t: t+h}^{r}\right) / h}{\gamma \operatorname{var}\left(r_{t: t+h}^{r}\right) / h} \tag{8.26}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
now with $y_{h, t}^{r}$ as the [risk-free rate](Black Scholes Derivation.md) and with long-term variance of real [returns](Assets.md) var $\left(r_{t: t+h}^{r}\right)$.
How to estimate expected excess [returns](Assets.md) in this case? Given that the investor cares about real [returns](Assets.md) and the relevant real [risk-free rate](Black Scholes Derivation.md) is now $y_{h, t}^{r}$, the investor needs an estimate of $\mathbb{E}\left[r_{t+1}^{r}\right]-y_{h, t}^{r}$. One possibility would be to calculate realized log real risky [asset returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%201%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Overview/Some%20Stylized%20Empirical%20Facts%20About%20Asset%20Retur.md) in historical data by subtracting realized log [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) each period and taking the average to estimate $\mathbb{E}\left[r_{t+1}^{r}\right]$. But average real yields may have been different in the past than what they are currently, and so a better approach may be to focus on average excess [returns](Assets.md) to estimate $\mathbb{E}\left[r_{t+1}^{r}\right]-y_{h, t}^{r}$. One could estimate this [expected excess return](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%209%20-%20Factor%20Models/Theoretical%20Factors.md) by calculating the average difference between real [returns](Assets.md) on the risky asset and real [returns](Assets.md) of TIPS of maturity $h$ (or, ideally, $h$-year zero-coupon bond real [returns](Assets.md) implied by TIPS [returns](Assets.md)) in historical data. Equivalently, one could look at the average difference of the nominal return on the risky asset and the nominal return on TIPS.
  
One problem with this approach is that the available data series of TIPS [returns](Assets.md) are still quite short as the TIPS market did not exist before 1997. To the extent that T-bills rolled over are actually a reasonably good [risk-free asset](../Financial%20Engineering/2.%20Forwards,%20Swaps,%20Futures,%20and%20Options.md) in real terms for a long-term investor, one could also look at the average difference between nominal [returns](Assets.md) on the risky asset and the nominal return on T-bills-i.e., exactly what we were doing in lecture 5 when we focused on nominal [returns](Assets.md).
  
Finally, the investor needs an estimate of the variance of long-run real [returns](Assets.md) $\operatorname{var}\left(r_{t: t+h}^{r}\right)$. Here, too, one could potentially just look at the variance of realized log risky [asset returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%201%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Overview/Some%20Stylized%20Empirical%20Facts%20About%20Asset%20Retur.md) adjusted for [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). That said, if we look back at historical data, real yields have varied over time, and so the best estimate of what var $\left(r_{t: t+h}^{r}\right)$ will be going forward may be one that looks at the variance of the excess real return over and above real yields. Since real yields don't vary all that much, this should not make all that much difference, though, for most risky asset classes.
  
But there is again the issue that real yield data is not available for long historical time periods. To the extent that T-bills provide reasonably good protection from [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk, the real return of rolled-over T-bills could again be an alternative series to look at. For example, one could use historical data to calculate the variance single period (e.g., quarterly) nominal [returns](Assets.md) of the risky asset relative to nominal yields of T-bills, possibly adjusted for a potential long-term variance-reducing effect of negative [serial correlation](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%206/Level%20Versus%20Change%20Regressions.md) if such negative [serial correlation](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%206/Level%20Versus%20Change%20Regressions.md) exists, to get the implied estimate of $\operatorname{var}\left(r_{t: t+h}^{r}\right) / h$.
  
With [multiple risky assets](Lecture%202-%20Asset%20Allocation%20with%20Multiple%20Risky%20Assets.md), estimation of covariances could be done analogously to the variance estimation discussed above, e.g., with the covariances of nominal risky [asset returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%201%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Overview/Some%20Stylized%20Empirical%20Facts%20About%20Asset%20Retur.md) relative to T-bill yields as proxy for the covariances of real [returns](Assets.md) in excess of real yields.
  
### 8.6 Inflation in foreign countries
  
For a U.S. investor, a rise in the U.S. [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rate leads to a loss of purchasing power, unless the assets are hedged against U.S. [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk. But if the [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) includes foreign assets, what does foreign [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) do to the real value of the U.S. investor's [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md)? To be concrete, suppose that the U.S. investor owns a foreign government bond with nominally [fixed cash flows](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) in foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). The investor's purchasing power depends on the nominal dollar value of the bond deflated by the U.S. [consumer price index](Pricing an Inflation Swap.md). Hence, foreign [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) does not directly reduce the purchasing power that the U.S. investor gets from this bond. But foreign [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) is likely to have an effect on the exchange rate that reduces the value of the foreign bond in terms of U.S. dollars, and thereby affects the investor's purchasing power indirectly.
  
Let $S_{t}$ be the exchange rate in terms of units of foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) that must be paid to get 1$. A theory of exchange rates called purchasing-power parity (PPP) says that exchange rates should reflect the different levels of purchasing power that currencies have. The idea is that in an ideal world in which trade is frictionless, the prices of goods and services should be the same across countries once they are expressed in the same [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),
  $$
\begin{equation*}
S_{t}=\frac{C P I_{\text {foreign }}}{C P I_{U S}} \tag{8.27}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
so if prices in local [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) are higher in the foreign country, one should have to pay more than one unit of foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) to obtain 1$ so that the exchange rate undoes the differences in price levels. In terms of exchange [rate changes](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md) over time, we then get
  $$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{S_{t+1}}{S_{t}}=\frac{1+\Pi_{\text {foreign }, t+1}}{1+\Pi_{U S, t+1}} \tag{8.28}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
so exchange [rate changes](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md) should reflect differentials in [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates. (Equation (8.28) is actually more general than equation (8.27) because it also holds if there is a constant wedge in purchasing power of the two currencies, e.g., due to different levels of economic development. This would lead to a constant factor multiplying the right-hand side of (8.27), which drops out after taking the ratio of exchange rates in different periods in (8.28).)
  
Now, the empirical evidence does not suggest that (8.28) is a great description of how exchange rates behave in the short run. But over longer periods, PPP helps understand exchange rate movements. ${ }^{7}$ PPP provides a good guide to exchange rate movements during hyperinflation episodes.

Figure 8.10: [Inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and exchange rate to USD in Turkey
  
A recent example is the hyperinflation that started in Turkey in 2022. Figure 8.10 plots the [consumer price index](Pricing an Inflation Swap.md) in Turkey since 2017. Prices more than quadrupled during the seven years shown in the plot, a rise by about $350 \%$, which means the local purchasing power of the Turkish lira fell by about $78 \%$. The same plot also shows the exchange rate, expressed in units of Turkish lira per 1$. As the purchasing power of the lira fell, the exchange rate depreciated strongly from around $1 / 4=0.25$ dollars per lira down to $1 / 27=0.037$ dollars per lira, which is a lira depreciation of about $85 \%$, which is roughly in the same ballpark as the loss of purchasing power of the lira, and hence roughly in line with (8.28).
  
The consequences of the Turkish [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) for an U.S. investor holding Turkish bonds is that the dollar value of these bonds has fallen by a large percentage. So foreign [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk is highly relevant for the U.S. investor, but it manifests indirectly through exchange rate movements.
  
### 8.7 Economic causes of inflation
  
To understand how [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) risk may materialize, we need to understand the economic causes of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). Most macroeconomic models of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) suggest that the following factors influence [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md).
  
[Output gap](../International%20Finance/Economic%20Stabilization%20Notes/Topics%20in%20Fiscal%20and%20Monetary%20Policies%20and%20Stabilization-%20Empirical%20Issues.md): Recall from the last lecture that the [output gap](../International%20Finance/Economic%20Stabilization%20Notes/Topics%20in%20Fiscal%20and%20Monetary%20Policies%20and%20Stabilization-%20Empirical%20Issues.md) measures the level of GDP or employment relative to the economy's maximum current capacity. Situations in which the economy is operating close to capacity, and hence the [output gap](../International%20Finance/Economic%20Stabilization%20Notes/Topics%20in%20Fiscal%20and%20Monetary%20Policies%20and%20Stabilization-%20Empirical%20Issues.md) small, gives firms more room to raise prices and workers more bargaining power to demand wage rises.
  
Cost-push shocks: These are shocks that drive up firms marginal cost of production. The supply chain problems that the U.S. economy experienced in the wake of the COVID pandemic are an example of such shocks. The huge increase in energy prices in some parts of the world following the start of the war in Ukraine in 2022 are another example.
  
[Inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md): The reason why [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) of future [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) can generate current [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) are more subtle than the more intuitive [output gap](../International%20Finance/Economic%20Stabilization%20Notes/Topics%20in%20Fiscal%20and%20Monetary%20Policies%20and%20Stabilization-%20Empirical%20Issues.md) and cost-push shock channels. Among other things, the [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) channel reflects the forward-looking nature of firms' price setting coupled with frictions in how often prices are revised. Consider two parties negotiating a long-term contract that fixes prices for the delivery of some goods over the next year. If the seller anticipates that prices will rise during the next year, the seller will demand that the long-term contract fixes higher prices already today. In this way, [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) of future [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) can lead to upward pressure on prices already today. So there can be a self-fulfilling aspect to [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md). If everyone expects high [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) it's likely that [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) is pushed higher. The same mechanism can apply in wage negotiations if a contract to be negotiated fixes wages over a certain term into the future.
  
Central banks, tasked with ensuring price stability, worry about this [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) effect because a mere change in people's beliefs about the future could generate [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). Possibly, [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) could be completely self-fulfilling. Then if people expect $10 \%$ [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) going forward, this generates current [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) of $10 \%$; if people will expect $100 \%$ going forward, this generates current [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) of $100 \%$; and so on. Any level of current [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) could arise. Put differently, if such self-fulfilling dynamics take hold, [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) will be extremely unstable and could easily explode. Once this happens, it would take big changes in [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) to generate a big [output gap](../International%20Finance/Economic%20Stabilization%20Notes/Topics%20in%20Fiscal%20and%20Monetary%20Policies%20and%20Stabilization-%20Empirical%20Issues.md), i.e., a deep recession, to counteract this self-fulfilling inflationary dynamic.
  
This is why central banks put a lot of emphasis on stabilizing, or anchoring, [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md). If the central bank can convince people that it will always take action
to quickly bring [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) back to the target rate of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md), then people's [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) may stay close to the the central bank's [inflation target](../International%20Finance/Economic%20Stabilization%20Notes/Topics%20in%20Fiscal%20and%20Monetary%20Policies%20and%20Stabilization-%20Empirical%20Issues.md) $\Pi^{*}$, irrespective of the shocks that hit the economy. In particular, the self-fulfilling inflationary dynamics are not going to start. As a consequence, the central bank can then counteract [output gap](../International%20Finance/Economic%20Stabilization%20Notes/Topics%20in%20Fiscal%20and%20Monetary%20Policies%20and%20Stabilization-%20Empirical%20Issues.md) and cost-push shocks with relatively small changes in [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md), i.e., without causing a deep recession.
  
How can central banks achieve anchored [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md)? In a central banker's ideal world, public statements of central bankers would be perfectly credible. If so, the central bank could just announce what its [inflation target](../International%20Finance/Economic%20Stabilization%20Notes/Topics%20in%20Fiscal%20and%20Monetary%20Policies%20and%20Stabilization-%20Empirical%20Issues.md) is and people would immediately adjust their [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) to $\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\Pi_{t+1}\right]=\Pi^{*}$.
  
In practice, influencing [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) is a bit more difficult, especially if people had recent experiences with high [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates. To convince people that [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) will actually come down in the future, after an experience of high [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) over an extended period to time, they often need to see some action by the central bank that actually brings [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) down for a while before they are convinced that low [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) will prevail in the future. Beliefs shaped by personal experiences are not easy to overcome.
  
That people have a tendency to rely on past experiences in forming their views about future [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) (rather than, say, just adopting the guidance provided by central bankers' announcements) is actually not that easy to tease out from the data. If we look at the time-series of the average or median individual's expectation of future [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) and their correlation with past [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates, it's hard to disentangle whether past [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates are correlated with the average individual's [expected inflation rate](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md) simply because individuals correctly predict (e.g., based on what they hear from central bankers, and other experts) that [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) will persist into the future, or whether individuals rely too much on their past experiences in forming their [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md).
  
But if we look at heterogeneity in individuals' [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md), we can clearly see the experience effects at work. In a research project some years ago, my co-author Ulrike Malmendier and I showed that people's [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) are heavily shaped by their life-time experiences of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md). This is clearly visible as age-heterogeneity in [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md). Younger people's [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) are influenced by more recent data while older individuals' [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) are influenced by data from earlier years because their lifetime experiences stretch farther back into the past. The [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) of young and old therefore differ. For example, after a surge in [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates, young people's lifetime experience is quickly dominated by these high [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates, leading them to forecast higher future [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates. In contrast, older people average these recently high [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates with a larger set of historical experiences, and so the reaction of their [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) to this surge is more muted.
 ![500](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_10_19_48a1c4654e845915c45cg-293.jpg?height=1012&width=1435&top_left_y=605&top_left_x=367)
  
Figure 8.11: Differences in [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) by age
One-year [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) of age groups in excess of the cross-sectional mean across age groups each period. Data from the Michigan Survey of Consumers. Until 2009Q4: Malmendier, U. and Nagel, S., 2016. Learning from [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) experiences. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 131(1), pp.53-87; out-of-sample periods after 2009Q4 are updates post-publication. Solid lines show [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) forecasts from an $\mathrm{AR}(1)$ model estimated on each age group's lifetime data of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md).
  
Figure 8.11 presents the evidence for these sorts of life-time experience effects in the Michigan Survey of Consumers, a monthly survey that has been conducted for many decades. The small circles show the average [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) expectation every quarter of people in three age groups: young (age $<40$ ) in blue, middle-aged $(40 \leq a g e \leq 60)$ in red, older people (age $>60$ ) in black. To focus purely on cross-sectional differences at each point in time between these age groups, the figure shows the [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) relative to the overall cross-sectional mean of everyone's [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) expectation at that point in time. In other words, when a group shows up with a value above zero in this plot, it means that this group has above-average [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) in this period; if it shows up below zero, it has below-average [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) in this period.
  
Examining the plot, we see that as [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates were rising throughout the 1970s until the early 1980s, a gap opens up between young and old. By 1981, around the time [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) peaked, younger individuals expected about 3 percentage points higher [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) over the next year than older individuals. Over the following decades, this gap closed and eventually reverted. In the noughties, the gap turned negative. In the noughties, older individuals had higher [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) than younger individuals, consistent with the memory of the high [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) in the 1970s that is absent in younger individuals' life-time experience.
  
The solid lines in the figure show the [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) prediction that comes out of a model in which each birth cohort of individuals forms [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) by estimating an $\mathrm{AR}(1)$ model of the [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rate using [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) data that they have seen during their lifetimes. These solid lines match quite well the opening of the gap between young and old in the 1970s/80s, and the subsequent closing of this gap and eventual reversal. This means that we can approximately understand people's [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) as being informed by the mean and persistence of the [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates that they have experienced during their lifetimes.
  
From a central banker's viewpoint, the fact that we see these experience-dependent differences between young and old means that experiences exert a force that is not so easy to overcome just with words and announcements. Moreover, the unanchoring of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) that central bankers are typically worried about is likely to happen more quickly for younger individuals. ${ }^{8}$ On the other hand, once [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) of the general population have become unanchored, it will be particularly difficult to re-anchor those of older individuals because a few quarters of low [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) will do little to alter their extensive set of historical experiences.

It's good news for the Federal Reserve that a big unanchoring of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) has not happened yet following the recent surge of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) in 2022. The breakeven [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates in Figure 8.7 shows that the bond market prices in somewhat higher expected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md), but this is still far from the expected [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rates of around $10 \%$ that were registered the last time [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) surged in the early 1980s.
  
### 8.8 Fiscal crises and inflation
  
The macroeconomic forces influencing [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) that we discussed so far may explain quite well how [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) is determined in times when the economy is exposed to moderatelysized shocks, the general economic policy environment is functioning well, and the central bank can stay focused on its job of stabilizing the economy.
  
In more extreme situations, however, there is a risk in the background that the central bank may be drawn away from the job of stabilizing the economy towards supporting a fiscally challenged government. A condition for the central bank to be able to carry out [Risk and Return](Lecture%207-[[Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds) of Bonds#7.6 [Asset price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) reactions to [monetary policy](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) surprises|[monetary policy](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md)]] that stabilizes the economy and [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) is that the government pursues a sound [fiscal policy](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md). If the government gets into a budget crisis, or even if investors just anticipate that it might, the central bank may be forced into supporting government finances.
  
Many big inflationary episodes in history occurred in situations when the country's government was in fiscal trouble. As a typical example, the table in Figure 8.12 shows the budget situation of Germany's government in the years leading up to the hyperinflation in 1923. The numbers are shown in millions of goldmarks, which was a gold-backed money in use in Germany at the time (and which did not lose real value during the hyperinflation). In parallel, there was fiat money (which lost all its real value) that the central bank printed in massive amounts to finance the government's budget deficit. As the table shows, in the 1922-23 fiscal year, about two thirds of government expenditure was financed by government borrowing.
  
Selling bonds becomes difficult for the government as investors start doubting the ability of the government to honor its debt. Historically, when this happened, it often led to the central bank stepping in to buy bonds or bills issued by the government and paying for it with newly printed money. This is what happened in Germany in the years leading up to the hyperinflation. In modern economies, this would not involve actual printing of paper money, but a rise in the aggregate amount of bank deposits and the aggregate amount of reserves that banks hold in their account at the central bank. When the central bank buys [government debt](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Global%20Fixed%20Income%20Markets.md) from investors and pays for it with reserves, then investors get more money in their bank accounts, and the investors' banks will in turn see their reserve deposits at the central bank go up.
  
But just like government bonds, money in paper form, or in the form of bank deposits backed by reserve deposits at the central bank, is ultimately backed by the willingness of the government to raise sufficient taxes relative to expenditure to support the value of these claims. If households and firms no longer believe that this is the case, they will not like holding on to large amounts of money. They will try to exchange money for items that are more likely to keep their value if the government fails to honor its commitments: real estate, stocks, durable goods, foreign assets, etc. The consequence of this desire to spend money quickly is a rise in prices, which in turn may generate higher expected future [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md), which can in turn further fuel current [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md).
  
Fiscal reforms that bring the budget back into balance have been key in ending many hyperinflations in history. The table in Figure 8.13 shows how dramatically the German government budget swung into surpluses in the months after the hyperinflation. Tangible signs that the government was committed to this path of ending deficits (by raising taxes, taking action to cut expenditure, renegotiation of war reparation payments) helped convince people that they can hold on to their money and bank deposits without trying to get rid of them like a hot potato. Also keep in mind that the hyperinflation reduced the outstanding [government debt](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Global%20Fixed%20Income%20Markets.md) to a real value of effectively zero. So fiscal consolidation required only bringing current and future revenues in line with expenditure, it did not require making large payments in real terms to previous debtholders.

Many other hyperinflations in history, e.g., several in Latin America in the second half of the 20th century, show similar connections to fiscal turmoil in the rise of [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) and fiscal consolidation in the eventual end of inflationary episodes.
  
While these historic episodes may not be immediately relevant for developed markets in the current environment, some recent events during the COVID pandemic show at least a qualitative similarity with budget deficits, jittery bond markets, large-scale bond purchases by the central bank, higher [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md), and some investors looking for ways to preserve their purchasing power. The situation was far, far less dramatic, but still, perhaps some caution is warranted.
  
The COVID pandemic lead to government programs that strongly increased government budget deficits. Somewhat surprisingly, in March 2020 the U.S. Treasury bond market seemed to have trouble digesting the high supply of Treasury bonds. During several days in March 2020, long-term Treasury bond yields rose, even though [the Fed](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) lowered [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and short-term yields came down strongly, as shown in Figure 8.14.

Compared to other historical episodes of market turmoil in response to bad economic news, this reaction of Treasury yields was highly unusual. The usual crisis pattern was that Treasury bond yields would fall strongly in anticipation of steep interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
  
The Federal Reserve then quickly stabilized the situation toward the end of March by starting a massive bond purchase program. As Figure 8.15, [the Fed](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) added around 1.5 trillion dollars worth of bonds to its balance sheet within a few weeks. And [the Fed](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) kept these bonds on its balance sheet even after the crisis subsided. It is not clear what the effect on Treasury yields would have been if [the Fed](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) had tried to sell these bonds back to the public in the months following the crisis episode.

### 8.9 Fiscal crises and sovereign default
  
When governments get into a fiscal crisis and have much of their debt denominated in domestic [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md), [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) is the typical consequence of fiscal crisis. In principle, governments could also choose the path of defaulting on their debts, but monetary financing and [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) are much more common for dealing with large domestic debts.
  
Looking at the world history of such crises, the solid line in Figure 8.16 shows what the authors call "Composite Probability of Domestic Default": this is the share of countries in a given year that have either high [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) (above 20\%) or are in a state of default on their domestic debt. ${ }^{9}$ The vast majority of these cases are hyperinflations, not default.
  
In contrast, when a government has external debt, denominated in foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md), [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) does not reduce the real value of the debt. If [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) takes off strongly, the exchange rate will collapse, so that the value of the foreign debt expressed in domestic [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) rises. [Inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) therefore cannot resolve a fiscal crisis. So for external debts,
  
[^43]governments choose the path of default instead. As the dashed line in Figure 8.16 shows, there are time periods when a large share of countries in the world are in a state of default on external debt, including the 1980s when many developing countries experienced fiscal crises and default.
  
When a bond is at risk of default, investors reduce the price they are willing to pay. This raises the yield of the bond and as a compensation for the risk of default. To be concrete, consider the following example. Outstanding debt is in the form of a zero-coupon bond with principal of 1$ and maturity in one period. The probability that the government will default is $10 \%$. Suppose that if the government defaults, it will restructure the debt so that bond holders obtain a value that is worth only $40 \%$ of the principal that they are owed. Hence, the recovery rate is $40 \%$, or the loss given default is $1-0.40=60 \% .{ }^{10}$ Suppose that investors price default-free bonds to earn a yield of $5 \%$.
  
Let's first consider the case of [risk-neutral investors](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%208/An%20Analytical%20Decomposition%20of%20Forward%20Rates.md). [Risk-neutral investors](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%208/An%20Analytical%20Decomposition%20of%20Forward%20Rates.md) would price this bond subject to [default risk](Default Risk and Credit Derivatives 183.md) at the expected payoff discounted at the defaultfree yield,
  $$
\begin{equation*}
P=\frac{0.90 \times $ 1+0.10 \times $ 0.40}{1+0.05}=$ 0.8952 \tag{8.29}
\end{equation*} $$
which means that the promised yield is \$1 / 0.8952-1=11.71 \%$. It's called the promised yield because this is what the borrower promises to pay, but the investor (fully) earns it only if the issuer does not default on the obligations of the bond. The higher the default probability, and the lower the [recovery rate](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%203.md), the lower the price.
  
The [credit spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) relative to the default-free yield, \$11.71 \%-5 \%=6.71 \%$ is the additional yield that the investor earns in the event that there is no default. This additional yield the investor earns in the no-default case is compensation for the losses the investor will experience if there is default. In the case of [risk-neutral investors](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%208/An%20Analytical%20Decomposition%20of%20Forward%20Rates.md) that we are considering here, the magnitude of the [credit spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) is exactly equal to the expected loss as a percentage of the price of the bond:
  $$
\begin{equation*}
0.1 \times \frac{0.60}{0.8952}=6.71 \% \tag{8.30}
\end{equation*}
  
Despite the elevated credit spread, the expected return on this risky bond is the same as the default-free yield,
  
$$$$\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{E}[R]=0.9 \times 11.71 \%+0.1 \times\left(\frac{0.40}{0.8952}-1\right)=5 \% \tag{8.31}
\end{equation*}
$$
  
[^44]which simply reflects the fact that [risk-neutral investors](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%208/An%20Analytical%20Decomposition%20of%20Forward%20Rates.md) would price all assets to have the same [expected return](Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md).
  
Now, in practice investors are not [risk neutral](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%207-Exotic%20Options%20And%20Derivative%20Pricing%20By%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation.md). And defaults are typically viewed as systematic risks. They are more likely to happen in [economic downturns](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/How%20the%20Eggheads%20Cracked.md) in which other risky assets perform poorly, too. Hence, investors require an [expected return](Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) premium to hold default-risky bonds. Suppose that investors are willing to pay only 0.83$ for this bond. Then the promised yield is $1 / 0.83-1=20.48 \%$, and hence the [expected return](Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) is$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{E}[R]=0.9 \times 20.48 \%+0.1 \times\left(\frac{0.40}{0.83}-1\right)=13.25 \% \tag{8.32}
\end{equation*}
$$
which is hence $8.25 \%$ higher than the default-free yield. In this case, the promised yield of $20.48 \%$ has three components:
  
The default-free yield of $5 \%$
Expected loss due to default $0.1 \times \frac{0.60}{0.83}=7.23 \%$
[Expected excess return](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%209%20-%20Factor%20Models/Theoretical%20Factors.md) $8.25 \%$
  
The [credit spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) of $20.48 \%-5 \%=15.48 \%$ is the sum of the last two components.
This makes clear that for bonds with substantial risk of default one should not interpret the promised yield as an [expected return](Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md). If [default risk](Default Risk and Credit Derivatives 183.md) is substantial, the [expected return](Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) can be far lower than the promised yield.
  
Is sovereign [default risk](Default Risk and Credit Derivatives 183.md) compensated with higher expected excess [returns](Assets.md)? Evidence from two centuries of data in Figure 8.17 suggests so. The plots show [risk and return](Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds.md) of countries' external debt issued in U.S. dollars or British pounds, using real [returns](Assets.md) calculated by deflating with the U.S. or U.K. [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) rate, respectively.
  
Figure 8.17a shows return standard deviations of sovereign debt of different countries on the x-axis and average real [returns](Assets.md) on the y-axis. Countries marked in red are countries that are serial defaulters; they had multiple default events during the past 200 years, and their [returns](Assets.md) are generally riskier. But as the plot shows, investors also earned a higher [expected excess return](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%209%20-%20Factor%20Models/Theoretical%20Factors.md).
  
Figure 8.17b shows betas with respect to the U.S. (for U.S. dollar bonds) or U.K. (for British pound bonds) equity market indices. On the y-axis is the excess return relative to U.S. or U.K. government bonds. This analysis focuses on a more recent period since 1995 since before that time the number of dollar or pound bonds outstanding has been very small and the data sparse. The plot shows that systematic risk of the debt of serial

defaulters is substantial: many betas reach 0.4 to 0.6 and in annualized terms their excess return was about $10 \%$. For comparison, the U.S. [stock market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) earned about $10 \%$ excess return annually during this period, so the risk compensation that sovereign bond investors earned during this period was actually quite a bit higher than predicted by the CAPM.
  
From a [Portfolio](Lecture%205-%20Dynamic%20[[An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer) Choice|[portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md) choice]] viewpoint, the above illustrates that the risk of sovereign debt is clearly systematic. Concerns about defaults that lead to declines in prices of risky sovereign debt seem to be concentrated in periods when developed [equity markets](../Financial%20Engineering/An%20Introduction%20to%20Equity%20Markets.md) are also doing poorly.
  
As a final remark, I want to point out that countries in Europe that have adopted the euro as [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) are in a somewhat unusual position. They don't fit the rule of thumb that domestic debt problems tend to be resolved through [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) and external debt problems through default. Countries in the eurozone have issued predominantly domestic debt in the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) that they use domestically (the euro), but because they are in a [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) union, countries do not have control of [Risk and Return](Lecture%207-[[Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds) of Bonds#7.6 [Asset price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) reactions to [monetary policy](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) surprises|[monetary policy](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md)]]. Instead, [Risk and Return](Lecture%207-[[Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds) of Bonds#7.6 [Asset price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) reactions to [monetary policy](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) surprises|[monetary policy](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md)]] is set by the European Central Bank (ECB). So individual countries do not have control of a central bank that could create money to buy up their sovereign debt and inflate away the debt. As a consequence, fiscal crises play out less like in other developed countries that have control of their own central banks, but rather like in emerging markets countries that have issued lots of external debt in foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).
  
A few years after the Great [Financial Crisis](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md), the eurozone experienced a realization of such a crisis. [Greece](../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/Solutions/PSET%203%20Solution-Financial%20Instruments.md) went through a default (restructuring of debt). Other countries (Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Italy) were subject to concerns about possible default. Bond yields reflected these elevated [default probabilities](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%203.md) as shown in Figure 8.18. Things calmed down eventually when the ECB developed programs that could be used to purchase sovereign debt of eurozone member countries. To this day, these problems are still simmering under the surface and have not been resolved.

To control for these other factors driving participation, I condition on having at least some [stock market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) [investment](An Asset Allocation Primer.md).

With power utility, $U^{\prime \prime}(\mathbb{E} W) / U^{\prime}(\mathbb{E}[W])=-\gamma / \mathbb{E}[W]$. Combining with the approximation $W_{0} \approx \mathbb{E}[W]$ and $W-\mathbb{E}[W]=W_{0} \omega(R-\mathbb{E}[R])$, we then get the stated result.
  
[^5]:    ${ }^{6}$ For those of you interested in the more philosophical underpinnings: The interpretation I'm giving here is the interpretation in the Bayesian branch of statistics. In this interpretation, $\mu$ is uncertain, and $\sigma(\hat{\mu})$ tells us in which range around $\hat{\mu}$ the true $\mu$ is likely to be located. The formal interpretation of the standard error in a different branch of statistics that follows the frequentist tradition-which is what taught in most statistics courses - is different. There one thinks of a fixed true $\mu$ and hypothetically imagines re-running the world many times, calculating $\hat{\mu}$ in each of new samples. The standard error tells how much the $\hat{\mu}$ would vary across these samples given a fixed true $\mu$. From a decision-making perspective in investments, where we cannot re-run world (and asset market) history, we are not really interested in how estimates would vary if, hypothetically, we could re-run the world. Instead, we have one set of data from the history our world lived through that we want to use to assess $\mu$. From this viewpoint, the Bayesian perspective is more appropriate. We want to quantify how much uncertainty about $\mu$ we are left with, given the data we have been able to observe.${ }^{7}$ In fact, we would get something like this even if the $\varepsilon_{t}$ were not normal. A result in statistics called the (Bayesian) central limit theorem tells us that $\mu$ would still be well approximated by a normal distribution as long as we have a relatively large sample of data, i.e., $T$ is large, even if the individual draws of $\varepsilon_{t}$ are not from a normal distribution.
  
[^6]:    ${ }^{1}$ For those interested in some more (optional) detail: Using high-frequency data to estimate variances works perfectly, in the sense that we could get infinitely precise estimates in the limit of infinitesimally small return measurement periods, when [returns](Assets.md) are generated as a continuous-time diffusion (a continuous-time diffusion does not have any discrete jumps, no matter how small we make the return measurement interval). This point was shown in [Merton](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%205.md), Robert C., 1980, On estimating the [expected return](Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) on the market, Journal of Financial Economics 8, 323-361.
  
[^7]:    ${ }^{2}$ For those who are interested in how to show this: Take the decomposition of the covariance matrix that we used earlier, $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}=\boldsymbol{S C S}$. Let $\omega^{*}$ be the weights of the [risk parity portfolio](Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) which are proportional to $1 / \sigma_{i}$ for each asset class. The covariances of each asset class with the [risk parity portfolio](Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md), using (2.8), are $\boldsymbol{\Sigma} \omega^{*}$, which is proportional to $\boldsymbol{S} \boldsymbol{C} \boldsymbol{\iota}$ because the standard deviations in $\boldsymbol{S}$ multiply with their reciprocals in $\omega^{*}$. Premultiplying each covariance with the weight $1 / \sigma_{i}$ to get the total risk contribution of each asset class to the [portfolio](An Asset Allocation Primer.md), we get $\boldsymbol{C} \boldsymbol{\iota}$. As we discussed earlier, each element of the vector $\boldsymbol{C} \boldsymbol{\iota}$ is equal if $\boldsymbol{C}$ is an equicorrelation matrix. Therefore, the total risk contribution of each asset class is eqaual.

If we think of $Y$ as the information that investors have at $t+1$ and that investors at $t$ could not yet observe, then we can write this as $\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\mathbb{E}_{t+1}\left[X_{t+2}\right]\right]=\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[X_{t+2}\right]$. But this law does not apply to [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) of other people's future [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md) if there is disagreement. For example, if I expect that investors next period will be too optimistic about future earnings growth, then my expectation of their expectation of earnings growth is not the same as my own expectation of future earnings growth.

[^20]:    ${ }^{1}$ Why does the sentiment model produce lower expected long run [returns](Assets.md) when we switch from the cases with sentiment to the no-sentiment case? In these simulations, I hold the short-run expected log return constant. While return volatility is the same in all the different cases with sentiment, and hence the expected simple short-term return is the same in all those, return volatility is much lower in the case without sentiment. As a consequence, by (5.12), the expected simple short-term return, and hence also the arithmetic mean of short-term [returns](Assets.md), is lower in the the no-sentiment case. Hence, as the compounded expected simple short-term return is equal to the expected long-term return, the expected long-term return is lower.
  
[^21]:    ${ }^{2}$ For those interested in further details: The formula for an approximately unbiased estimate of the long-run [expected return](Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) in this case is
  $$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{T-h}{T-1} \times(1+\text { arithm. mean })^{h}+\frac{h-1}{T-1} \times(1+\text { geom. mean })^{h}-1 \tag{5.16}

which yields a high weight on the arithmetic mean when $T$ is much bigger than $h$ and a high weight on the geometric mean when $T$ is not much larger than $h$.

[^22]:    ${ }^{3}$ I'm calculating these 10-year log return variances from quarterly 10-year moving sums of log [returns](Assets.md). Since these moving windows are moved forward one quarter of a time, they have a large degree of overlap. As a consequence, the number of overlapping 10-year log return observations I have is greater than the number of independent 10-year log return observations. For this reason, the usual degrees-of-freedom correction by dividing by $T-1$ instead of $T$ that functions in python or statistical packages implement is not correct. To correct this, I multiply the variance that I receive based on the standard degrees-offreedom correction by $((T-40-1) /(T-80))$. I do the same when I calculate long-run return variances from empirical data in the table that follows.

Absence of such arbitrages is a fundamental [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) principle in finance.${ }^{2}$ And in turn, [futures contracts](../Financial%20Engineering/Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) are almost equivalent to forward contracts, with some differences about the way margining is handled.

[^26]:    ${ }^{3}$ For the European put options that we are considering here, it can happen that $P_{t}<K-S_{t}$ in extreme situations where it is virtually certain that the option will end up in the money and will be exercised at maturity, e.g., if the current index level is so far below the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md), that it's virtually impossible that the option expires out of the money. To see why, suppose $S_{t}$ is far below $K$. As owner of a put option, you basically know for sure that a combined position of the index and the put will be worth $K$ after you exercise the option at maturity. The present value of this combined payoff is $\left.\operatorname{Kexp}\left[-r_{f}(T-t)\right]\right]$, so it must be true that $\left.S_{t}+P_{t}=\operatorname{Kexp}\left[-r_{f}(T-t)\right]\right]$, and hence $\left.P_{t}=\operatorname{Kexp}\left[-r_{f}(T-t)\right]\right]-S_{t}$, which is smaller than $K-S_{t}$. But unless [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) are very high, even in this extreme scenario here, $P_{t}$ can be just a very small amount below $K-S_{t}$.

[^31]:    ${ }^{3}$ One caveat. The zero-coupon yields I am using here have been extracted from coupon-bond yields with a method that already induces some smoothing in yields. It may therefore understate a little bit the idiosyncratic variation in yields of individual-maturity bonds and overstate the explanatory power of these three factors. But smoothing only has a small effect, the $R^{2}$ is also very close to one if one uses methods of zero-coupon bond yield construction that do not involve such smoothing.

[^33]:    ${ }^{5}$ This is an approximation. We should really be setting expected simple [returns](Assets.md) equal. For example, if the short-term yield was conditionally log-normal, then setting expected [returns](Assets.md) equal would yield $y_{t, 2}=\lambda+\frac{1}{2}\left[y_{t, 1}+\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[y_{t+1,1}\right]+\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{var}_{t}\left(y_{t+1,1}\right)\right]$, i.e., there is an additional conditional variance term, also known as a [convexity](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) term, as it reflects the [convexity](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of $\exp \left(y_{t+1,1}\right)$. If the conditional variance term is constant, we can just absorb it in the $\lambda_{2}$ in (7.13), but if it's time-varying, it would generate deviations from (7.13). Plausible values of this distortion are relatively small, though. So we ignore them here.

[^35]:    ${ }^{1}$ This equation also demonstrates an important principle of valuation. To value an asset, we need to either discount nominal cash flows with a nominal [discount rate](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/PSET%207-%20Kohler.md), as done in this equation, or, alternatively, we can discount real cash flows with real discount rates. The latter approach would be to calculate $V_{t}=\frac{\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[D_{t+1}\left(C P I_{t} / C P I_{t+1}\right)\right]}{1+R^{r}}=\frac{\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[D_{t+1}\right] E_{t}\left[C P I_{t} / C P I_{t+1}\right]}{1+R^{r}}$ where we used the fact that for a nominal asset [cash flow](Preview of the Book.md) and [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) are uncorrelated so we can write the expectation of the product as the product of the [expectations](FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE.md). We can then divide numerator and denominator by $E_{t}\left[C P I_{t} / C P I_{t+1}\right]$ and we get the same expression as (8.5).

With [returns](Assets.md) and [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) in logs, i.e., $r_{t: t+12}^{r}=\log \left(1+R_{t: t+12}^{r}\right)$ and $\pi_{t: t+12}=\log \left(1+\Pi_{t: t+12}\right)$, it would be exact: $r_{t: t+12}^{r}=r_{t: t+12}-\pi_{t: t+12}$.
  
[^37]:    ${ }^{3}$ In this regression, the data is monthly, but the windows over which [returns](Assets.md) and [inflation](War Economies and Hyperinflation.md) are measured span 12 months. Hence, the observations are from overlapping measurement windows. In this case, the usual regression formulas do not provide the correct standard errors and $t$-statistics. I use a simple and somewhat conservative fix for this: I calculate the standard errors from a similar regression that uses only non-overlapping data, i.e., I use only every 12 th observation of $R_{t: t+12}^{r}, U E_{t: t+12}$, and $\Delta E_{t: t+12}$.
