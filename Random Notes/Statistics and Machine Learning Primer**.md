# **1. Foundations of Probability and Moments**

**1.1 Probability Basics and Random Variables:** Probability theory provides a mathematical framework for quantifying uncertainty. A _random variable_ $X$ associates numerical outcomes to random phenomena. Its **distribution** specifies how probabilities are assigned to outcomes. For a _discrete_ random variable, probabilities $P(X=x)$ sum to 1 over all possible values; for a _continuous_ random variable, a probability density function (PDF) $f_X(x)$ integrates to 1 over the real line. An intuitive view is that probability distributions describe the relative frequency of outcomes in the long run. We often distinguish between _probability mass functions (pmf)_ for discrete $X$ and _probability density functions (pdf)_ for continuous $X$, but in both cases the distribution function $F_X(x) = P(X \le x)$ (CDF) is well-defined. In formal measure-theoretic terms, if $X$ has a finite or countable range, the distribution is characterized by $P(X=x)$ for each value; if $X$ ranges over continuum, we describe $P(a < X \le b)$ via integrals of a density . Ultimately, probabilities obey Kolmogorov’s axioms: $0 \le P(A) \le 1$, $P(\Omega)=1$, and countable additivity for disjoint events.

**1.2 Expected Value and Variance:** The **expected value** (or expectation, mean) of a random variable $X$ is the long-run average outcome and is defined as $E[X] = \sum_x x,P(X=x)$ for discrete $X$, or $E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x,f_X(x) dx$ for continuous $X$. Intuitively, it’s a probability-weighted average of possible values . For example, if $X$ takes values ${x_i}$ with probabilities $p_i$, then $E[X] = \sum_i x_i p_i$. The expectation operator $E[\cdot]$ is linear: $E[aX + bY] = a,E[X] + b,E[Y]$. The **variance** of $X$ measures the spread of $X$ around its mean: $\displaystyle \text{Var}(X) = E!\big[(X - E[X])^2\big] = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$. Variance is the second central moment; its positive square root is the standard deviation. For instance, a fair die $X\sim{1,\dots,6}$ has $E[X]=3.5$ and $\text{Var}(X)=\frac{35}{12}\approx 2.92$. Key properties like $\text{Var}(aX+b)=a^2\text{Var}(X)$ and $\text{Var}(X+Y)=\text{Var}(X)+\text{Var}(Y)$ for independent $X,Y$ are easily derived. One can also use the **computational formula**: $\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$ , which often simplifies calculations.

**1.3 Higher Moments: Skewness and Kurtosis:** Beyond mean (first moment) and variance (second moment), higher moments characterize distribution shape. **Skewness** is the third _central_ moment normalized by $\sigma^3$: $\displaystyle \gamma_1 = E!\Big[\Big(\frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}\Big)^3\Big]$. Skewness captures asymmetry: a symmetric distribution has skewness 0, left-skew (long tail to left) yields negative skewness, right-skew yields positive skew . **Kurtosis** is the fourth central moment normalized by $\sigma^4$: $\displaystyle \gamma_2 = E!\Big[\Big(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\Big)^4\Big]$. It measures tail heaviness (and peak sharpness). By convention, often _excess kurtosis_ = $\gamma_2 - 3$ is reported so that the normal distribution has excess kurtosis 0 . A distribution with high kurtosis has heavy tails/outliers (e.g. Cauchy has very high kurtosis), while low kurtosis indicates light tails (e.g. a bounded uniform). For example, an exponential distribution is right-skewed (skewness 2) and has higher kurtosis (9) than a normal (skewness 0, kurtosis 3) . These shape parameters help diagnose deviations from normality and are useful in risk management (finance) or quality control where tail behavior matters.

**1.4 Discrete vs Continuous Distributions:** A _discrete distribution_ assigns probabilities to countable outcomes ${x_i}$ (like Binomial, Poisson). The total probability sums to 1: $\sum_i P(X=x_i)=1$. The **probability mass function** (pmf) $p_X(x) = P(X=x)$ describes these probabilities. In contrast, a _continuous distribution_ has an uncountable range and is described by a **probability density function** $f_X(x)$ such that probabilities are given by integrals (e.g. $P(a\le X \le b) = \int_a^b f_X(x) dx$). For continuous $X$, $P(X=x)=0$ for any fixed $x$; only ranges have non-zero probability. Continuous distributions (like Uniform, Exponential, Normal) have smooth CDFs and often arise as limits of discrete models. Some distributions (mixed type) have both a discrete and continuous component, but most common cases fit one category. Whether discrete or continuous, the **expected value** is defined via sum or integral accordingly . To illustrate: the Bernoulli($p$) distribution (discrete) takes values 0/1 with $P(X=1)=p$; $E[X]=p$. The Uniform(0,1) distribution (continuous) has $f_X(x)=1$ for $0<x<1$ and 0 elsewhere; $E[X]=0.5$. Both fit into the same expectation formalism, changing a sum to an integral.

**1.5 Law of Large Numbers (LLN):** The LLN formalizes the idea that empirical averages converge to expected values as sample size grows. In its **Weak** form, for i.i.d. random variables $X_1, X_2, \dots$ with mean $\mu=E[X_i]$, the sample average $\overline{X}_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ converges _in probability_ to $\mu$ as $n\to\infty$. In other words, for any $\varepsilon>0$, $P(|\overline{X}_n - \mu| > \varepsilon) \to 0$. Intuitively, the chance that the average deviates significantly from the true mean becomes negligible for large $n$ . The_ **_Strong LLN_** _strengthens this to almost sure convergence: $P(\lim_{n\to\infty}\overline{X}_n = \mu)=1$ . The LLN justifies using long-run frequencies to estimate probabilities and implies stability of sample means. For example, flipping a fair coin many times, the proportion of heads will be very close to 0.5 with high probability once $n$ is large. Formally, one common proof of the WLLN uses Chebyshev’s inequality: $\text{Var}(\overline{X}_n) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$, so $P(|\overline{X}_n-\mu|>\varepsilon) \le \frac{\sigma^2}{n\varepsilon^2} \to 0$. Thus the probability of a noticeable deviation goes to zero, confirming the LLN. The LLN underpins the idea that larger samples yield more reliable estimates.

**1.6 Central Limit Theorem (CLT):** The CLT is one of the most profound results in probability. It says that the distribution of properly normalized sums (or averages) of i.i.d. random variables tends toward the **normal distribution**as $n$ becomes large, regardless of the original distribution’s shape (under mild conditions, such as finite variance). More precisely, if $X_1,\dots,X_n$ are i.i.d. with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, then the standardized sample mean $\displaystyle Z_n = \frac{\overline{X}_n - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$ converges in distribution to a standard Normal $N(0,1)$ as $n\to\infty$ . Equivalently, $\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ is approximately $N(n\mu,,n\sigma^2)$ for large $n$. The CLT explains why the normal curve appears so frequently in nature and justifies using normal-based inference for large samples. Importantly, the convergence is typically fast – even $n\approx 30$ often yields a fairly normal-looking distribution of $\overline{X}_n$.

_Figure 1: Illustration of the Central Limit Theorem. Left: Original distribution of an Exponential(1) random variable (mean 1, highly skewed). Right: The distribution of the sample mean of $n=30$ such i.i.d. variables, based on $10{,}000$ simulations, overlaid with a Normal $N(\mu=1,\ \sigma^2=1/30)$ density (red dashed curve). As predicted by the CLT, the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal ._

This figure demonstrates the CLT in action: even though individual exponential observations are skewed (blue histogram, left), the distribution of their average (orange histogram, right) is bell-shaped and concentrates around the true mean 1. The red dashed line is the theoretical $N(1,,1/30)$ density, showing a close match. The CLT is why many statistics (e.g. sample means, errors) are treated as normal when sample sizes are large. It also underlies the use of normal-based confidence intervals and hypothesis tests via approximate normality . There are various versions (Lindeberg–Feller CLT for weaker conditions, Lyapunov CLT, etc.), but the essence is the same – _aggregation of many small independent effects yields a Gaussian outcome_. This provides a bridge between microscopic randomness and the macroscopic regularity of the normal law.

**Practice Problem 1:** Suppose $Y$ takes value 10 with probability 0.2, value 5 with probability 0.5, and value 0 with probability 0.3. (a) Compute $E[Y]$ and $\text{Var}(Y)$. (b) Let $Y_1,\dots,Y_{100}$ be i.i.d. copies of $Y$. Using the CLT, approximate $P(\overline{Y}_{100} > 6)$. (c) Simulate 1000 averages of 100 such $Y$ values (with a computer) and compare the empirical distribution to a normal distribution predicted by (b).

## **2. Bayesian Statistics**

**2.1 Bayes’ Theorem Derivation and Interpretation:** Bayes’ Theorem is the cornerstone of Bayesian inference, relating conditional probabilities $P(A|B)$ and $P(B|A)$. It follows directly from the definition of conditional probability: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$ and $P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$. Setting these equal gives $P(A|B),P(B) = P(B|A),P(A)$. Solving for $P(A|B)$ yields the classic formula:

P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A)\,P(A)}{P(B)} \,.

This holds for events or for probability densities in continuous form. In words: **posterior ∝ prior × likelihood**, where $P(A)$ is the prior belief about $A$, $P(B|A)$ is the likelihood of seeing $B$ if $A$ is true, and $P(A|B)$ is the updated (posterior) probability of $A$ after observing $B$ . The denominator $P(B)$ is the total probability of $B$ (acting as a normalization constant), often computed via the Law of Total Probability: $P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A)$ in the simplest two-hypothesis case . For example, in medical testing, let $A$ be the event “patient has disease” and $B$ the event “test is positive.” Bayes’ theorem allows computing $P(A|B)$ (probability of disease given a positive test) by combining prior disease prevalence $P(A)$ with test sensitivity $P(B|A)$ and false positive rate $P(B|\neg A)$. This formula often reveals that the _posterior_ probability of disease can be surprisingly low if the disease is rare (small $P(A)$), even with a positive test – a key insight in diagnostic testing . In Bayesian statistics, this theorem is elevated to a principle: **today’s posterior becomes tomorrow’s prior** – one updates prior beliefs in light of new evidence using this rule.

**2.2 Priors, Likelihoods, and Posteriors:** In Bayesian analysis, we treat unknown parameters $\theta$ as random variables with a **prior distribution** $\pi(\theta)$ encoding our beliefs before seeing data. We have a statistical model (sampling distribution) for observations $D$ given $\theta$, specified via a **likelihood** $L(\theta; D) = P(D \mid \theta)$ (viewed as a function of $\theta$ for fixed data). Bayes’ rule then yields the **posterior distribution** $\pi(\theta \mid D) \propto L(\theta;D),\pi(\theta)$ . In words: Posterior = Prior $\times$ Likelihood (up to normalization). The posterior $\pi(\theta|D)$ combines prior information and data evidence. Often we write $\pi(\theta|D) = \frac{L(\theta;D),\pi(\theta)}{\int L(\theta;D),\pi(\theta),d\theta}$ for continuous $\theta$, where the denominator ensures the posterior integrates to 1 (this integral is the marginal likelihood or evidence). The **prior** $\pi(\theta)$ can be informative (specific strong beliefs) or non-informative/reference (intended to have minimal influence, like a flat prior). The **likelihood** encapsulates the information from the data – how plausible each $\theta$ makes the observed data. The **posterior** is the revised belief after seeing data. We also define the **posterior predictive** distribution to predict new data $y_{\text{new}}$: $P(y_{\text{new}}|D) = \int P(y_{\text{new}}|\theta),\pi(\theta|D),d\theta$, averaging predictions over the posterior.

_Example:_ Suppose we are inferring a coin’s bias $\theta=P(\text{Heads})$. Prior belief is $\theta \sim \text{Beta}(1,1)$ (uniform on [0,1], expressing no strong prior preference). We observe $D$: 8 heads in 10 tosses. The likelihood (given $\theta$) is $\binom{10}{8}\theta^8(1-\theta)^2$. The posterior $\pi(\theta|D) \propto \theta^8(1-\theta)^2 \cdot 1$ (since Beta(1,1) prior is constant) is recognized (after normalization) as $\text{Beta}(8+1,;2+1) = \text{Beta}(9,3)$. The posterior mean is $\frac{9}{9+3}=0.75$, and a 95% credible interval can be obtained from the Beta$(9,3)$ quantiles. This Bayesian update yields a most likely $\theta$ around 0.75, reflecting both prior and data (in this case, data dominated because the prior was diffuse). If we had a different prior (say Beta(20,20) reflecting a prior belief $\theta\approx0.5$), the posterior would be tempered by that belief. Bayesian analysis thus provides a coherent mechanism to incorporate prior knowledge with empirical evidence.

**2.3 Conjugate Priors and Bayesian Updates:** A prior and likelihood are **conjugate** if the resulting posterior is in the same parametric family as the prior. Conjugacy greatly simplifies Bayesian updating by yielding closed-form posteriors. For example, in the coin toss case above, the Beta prior and Binomial likelihood form a conjugate pair: Beta$(\alpha,\beta)$ prior + Binomial$(n,p)$ data $\implies$ Beta$(\alpha+x,\ \beta+n-x)$ posterior . Generally, for a likelihood in an exponential family, one can often find a conjugate prior. Classic conjugate pairs include: Beta prior for a Binomial likelihood (as above); Normal prior for the mean of a Normal likelihood (with known variance) yields Normal posterior; Gamma prior for Poisson rate or exponential rate yields Gamma posterior; Dirichlet prior for Multinomial yields Dirichlet posterior . Conjugacy is an _algebraic convenience_ – it allows us to bypass numerical integration and get analytical posteriors. It also provides insight: e.g., seeing how prior hyperparameters and data counts combine. Conjugate priors can be interpreted as adding “pseudo-observations.” In the Beta-Binomial example: prior $\text{Beta}(\alpha,\beta)$ is as if we had $\alpha-1$ prior heads and $\beta-1$ prior tails before actual data . If $\alpha=\beta=1$, it’s as if we start with no pseudo-data (uniform prior). If $\alpha=20,\beta=20$, it’s like prior information of 19 heads, 19 tails (a fairly strong prior towards fairness). The **predictive distribution** in conjugate models is also tractable. For instance, prior Beta$(\alpha,\beta)$ implies the prior predictive for $X\sim \text{Binomial}(n,\theta)$ is a Beta-Binomial distribution. Conjugate priors are not always available for complex likelihoods, but when they are, they provide neat closed-form formulas and intuition about how data update beliefs.

**2.4 Hierarchical Bayesian Models:** In hierarchical models, we introduce multiple levels of uncertainty by allowing parameters themselves to have hyper-parameters with priors (often called **hyperpriors**). A **hierarchical Bayesian model** is one where some prior parameters are not fixed but drawn from other distributions . This is useful when data are grouped or there are multiple related parameters. For example, suppose we are modeling exam scores of students in different classrooms. Each class $j$ has an unknown mean $\mu_j$. Rather than assume all classes share the same $\mu$, or treat each $\mu_j$ independently a priori, we can assume $\mu_j$ themselves are drawn from a population distribution (say $\mu_j \sim N(\mu_0,\sigma_0^2)$). We then place priors on the hyperparameters $\mu_0, \sigma_0$. This yields a multi-level prior: $P(\mu_j|\mu_0,\sigma_0)$ at level 2 and $P(\mu_0,\sigma_0)$ at level 3 . Hierarchical models “share strength” across groups – the data from all classes inform the population hyperparameters, which in turn influence each class’s posterior. This often produces _shrinkage_ of estimates toward a global average, improving estimates especially for small-group sample sizes (reducing overfitting to noisy small-group data). Technically, a two-level hierarchical model might look like: $\displaystyle \theta_i \sim \text{Prior}(\phi)$ for each group $i$, and hyperparameter $\phi \sim \text{Hyperprior}$. The joint posterior for all $\theta_i$ and $\phi$ is then computed. In practice, hierarchical Bayes is very flexible – almost any complex dependency can be modeled. Examples: multi-level regression (random effects models), Bayesian shrinkage in baseball batting averages (the famous Efron–Morris example), or hierarchical latent variable models (topic models in NLP). The trade-off is that closed-form posteriors rarely exist for multi-level models, so one often uses computational methods (MCMC or variational Bayes) to perform inference. But conceptually, hierarchical models better reflect many real-world structures (data with grouping, spatial/temporal correlation, etc.) by treating model parameters themselves as random with higher-level distributions .

**2.5 Bayesian Inference Techniques (Analytic and MCMC):** When conjugacy is present or the model is simple, we can derive **analytic posteriors** as above. But for complex models, integrals for normalization or predicting new data may not have closed forms. In those cases, we resort to computational inference methods. Two main approaches are: (a) **Monte Carlo** methods, especially Markov Chain Monte Carlo (see Section 4), and (b) **approximate inference** such as Variational Bayes or Laplace’s method. **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** algorithms like Metropolis–Hastings or Gibbs sampling simulate draws from the posterior by constructing a Markov chain that has the posterior as its stationary distribution . By drawing a sufficiently long chain, one can approximate posterior expectations and credible intervals. MCMC is very general and, with modern computing, a standard tool for Bayesian inference – it can handle high-dimensional, correlated parameter spaces where direct integration is impossible. **Gibbs sampling** leverages conditional posteriors: if you can sample each parameter conditional on others, you iterate through parameters sampling from $P(\theta_j|\text{rest},D)$ which yields a chain converging to $P(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_m|D)$. **Metropolis–Hastings** is more general: propose a random move in parameter space and accept it with certain probability ensuring detailed balance . These methods are discussed more in Section 4. Another approach is **Variational Inference**, which poses inference as optimization: approximate the posterior with a simpler distribution $q(\theta)$ by minimizing KL-divergence between $q$ and the true posterior. This converts integration into an optimization problem (often easier for very large-scale problems). **Laplace’s method** approximates the posterior by a Gaussian centered at the posterior mode (using second derivative information). These approximations trade off some accuracy for speed. Finally, one can also use **Bayes factors** or other Bayesian model comparison metrics to compare models, which involve computing the _evidence_ $P(D)$ (marginal likelihood) – often challenging to compute, again requiring specialized techniques or approximation.

In summary, Bayesian inference provides a powerful, coherent framework. Its core steps are: specify a prior, write down the likelihood, apply Bayes’ rule to get the posterior, and then compute whatever summaries or decisions needed (often via integration or simulation). When direct calculation is infeasible, simulation (MCMC) or approximation methods step in. Bayesian methods shine especially when incorporating prior knowledge is crucial or when one needs full probabilistic descriptions of uncertainty (as opposed to point estimates). The price is often computational – but thanks to advances in algorithms and computing power, Bayesian approaches are now practical in many complex problems (from hierarchical models with hundreds of parameters to modern deep learning Bayesian neural networks with variational approximations).

**Practice Problem 2:** You have a biased coin and wish to estimate its bias $\theta$. You decide on a $\text{Beta}(2,2)$ prior (mean 0.5). You flip the coin 20 times and observe 14 heads and 6 tails. (a) Derive the posterior distribution for $\theta$. (b) Find the posterior mean and posterior mode. (c) If you were to predict the result of 10 future flips, what is the distribution of the number of heads (the posterior predictive)? (d) [Conceptual] How would results differ with a $\text{Beta}(10,10)$ prior versus a $\text{Beta}(1,1)$ prior, given the same data?

## **3. Statistical Inference and Hypothesis Testing**

**3.1 Point Estimation (MLE, Method of Moments):** Statistical inference often begins with estimating population parameters from sample data. A **point estimate** is a single number estimate of a parameter $\theta$. Two classical approaches are: the **Method of Moments (MoM)** – choose $\hat{\theta}$ such that the sample moments match the population moments (e.g. set sample mean equal to theoretical mean to solve for $\hat{\theta}$); and the **Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE)** – choose $\hat{\theta}$ that maximizes the likelihood function $L(\theta) = P(data \mid \theta)$. Under regular conditions, MLEs have appealing properties: they are consistent (converge to true $\theta$ as $n\to\infty$), asymptotically normal (CLT applies to $\hat{\theta}$), and often efficient (lowest possible variance asymptotically). For example, given i.i.d. $X_1,\dots,X_n \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$, the MLE for $\mu$ is $\hat{\mu} = \bar{X}$ and for $\sigma^2$ is $\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum (X_i-\bar{X})^2$. Method of moments in this case would equate sample mean to $\mu$ (giving same $\hat{\mu}$) and sample variance to $\sigma^2$ (unbiased MoM would use $1/(n-1)$ denominator though). In practice, MLE is widely used for its general applicability (just differentiate log-likelihood and set derivative to zero) and desirable large-sample behavior. However, MLE can be biased in small samples and sensitive to model misspecification. Other estimation methods include **Bayesian estimators** (e.g. posterior mean) and **minimax or unbiased estimators** under decision-theoretic criteria, but MLE and MoM form a foundational toolkit for parametric inference.

**3.2 Confidence Intervals and Interpretation:** A **confidence interval** (CI) provides a range of plausible values for a parameter with a certain confidence level (usually 95%). Formally, a 95% CI for $\theta$ is an interval $I(X_{1:n})$ computed from data such that $P(\theta \in I(X_{1:n})) = 0.95$ (under repeated sampling) . It’s crucial to interpret this correctly: **confidence 95%** means that in the long run, 95% of intervals computed from independent samples will cover the true $\theta$. It **does not** mean there’s a 95% probability the specific interval contains $\theta$ (the parameter is fixed, not random, in classical inference) . For example, suppose $\bar{X}=50$ is the mean of $n=100$ samples from a population with unknown mean $\mu$ and known $\sigma=15$. A 95% CI for $\mu$ is $\bar{X} \pm 1.96,\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = 50 \pm 1.96*(15/10) = 50 \pm 2.94 = (47.06,;52.94)$. We are “95% confident” $\mu$ lies in that interval in the sense that the procedure yields correct coverage 95% of the time . Confidence intervals are usually constructed as estimator $\pm$ (critical value) $\times$ (standard error). The critical value (like 1.96 for 95% with large $n$) comes from the sampling distribution of the estimator (often normal or $t$ distribution). For unknown variance, we use the Student-$t$ distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom for the mean’s CI: $\bar{X} \pm t_{n-1,0.975}, S/\sqrt{n}$. For proportions, a common large-sample 95% CI is $\hat{p} \pm 1.96\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/n}$. More advanced: we might invert hypothesis tests to get CIs (e.g. the set of $\theta$ not rejected by a test at level $\alpha$ forms a $100(1-\alpha)%$ CI). CIs provide more information than point estimates – they quantify uncertainty. A narrow CI indicates a precise estimate, while a wide CI indicates uncertainty (often due to small $n$ or high variability). Note: “95% confidence” is a statement about the procedure’s reliability, not about any single interval’s probability containing $\theta$ . In practice, we treat the interval as a plausible range for $\theta$. If a 95% CI for a difference in means is $(2.1,;5.3)$, we can say we’re highly confident the difference is positive (since the entire interval is above 0).

**3.3 Hypothesis Testing Framework (Null/Alternative, Errors):** Hypothesis testing is a structured way to use sample data to assess evidence about a claim regarding a population parameter. We formulate two complementary hypotheses: the **Null Hypothesis** $H_0$ (typically representing no effect or status quo) and the **Alternative Hypothesis** $H_1$ (indicating presence of effect or difference). For example, $H_0: \mu=0$ vs $H_1: \mu \neq 0$. We collect data and compute a test statistic (like a $Z$ or $t$ value) that measures deviation from $H_0$. We then obtain a **p-value**, the probability, assuming $H_0$ is true, of observing a test statistic as extreme as or more extreme than what we got. A small p-value indicates data are very unlikely under $H_0$ and thus provides evidence against $H_0$. If $p$ is below a predetermined significance level $\alpha$ (often 0.05), we **reject $H_0$** in favor of $H_1$. Otherwise, we **fail to reject $H_0$** (note: not “accept” – we simply don’t have evidence to reject). This framework controls the **Type I error**rate: the probability of rejecting $H_0$ when it’s actually true (false positive) is $\alpha$ by design . A **Type II error** is failing to reject $H_0$ when $H_1$ is true (false negative); its probability is typically denoted $\beta$ . The **power** of a test is $1-\beta$, the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when $H_1$ is true . There is a trade-off: lowering $\alpha$ (making the test more stringent) usually increases $\beta$ if we don’t increase sample size. A good test balances these, often by planning an $n$ that yields high power for a meaningful effect size. The paradigm of hypothesis testing can be illustrated by a courtroom analogy: $H_0$ is “defendant is innocent,” and evidence (data) must be strong enough (beyond reasonable doubt, analogous to p<0.05) to reject innocence in favor of guilt ($H_1$). If evidence is insufficient, we don’t convict (fail to reject $H_0$), which doesn’t prove innocence but indicates lack of strong evidence of guilt.

It’s important to report both the decision and the p-value or confidence interval, as a p-value conveys the strength of evidence. Misinterpretations are common: a p-value is _not_ the probability $H_0$ is true (it’s computed assuming $H_0$ true; it is a probability of data, not hypotheses). And $\alpha=0.05$ is a convention, not a magical boundary – context and consequences of errors should dictate significance levels.

**3.4 z-tests and t-tests:** These are among the simplest hypothesis tests for means. A **z-test** is used when the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is known (or sample size is large so that $S \approx \sigma$ by CLT). For testing $H_0: \mu=\mu_0$ vs some alternative, the test statistic is $Z = \frac{\bar{X}-\mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$. Under $H_0$, $Z \sim N(0,1)$ (approximately, if $n$ large). For a two-sided test at $\alpha=0.05$, we reject $H_0$ if $|Z| > 1.96$, equivalently if $p<0.05$. The corresponding 95% CI for $\mu$ is $\bar{X}\pm 1.96,\sigma/\sqrt{n}$ as discussed earlier. A **t-test** is used when $\sigma$ is unknown and sample size is not huge – we then use the Student-$t$ distribution. The one-sample $t$ statistic is $T = \frac{\bar{X}-\mu_0}{S/\sqrt{n}}$ which under $H_0$ follows a $t_{n-1}$ distribution. The rejection rule for a two-sided test at level $\alpha$ is $|T| > t_{n-1,1-\alpha/2}$, where $t_{\nu,p}$ is the $p$-quantile of a $t$ with $\nu$ degrees of freedom. The two-sample $t$-test compares means from two independent samples. If we assume equal variances, the pooled $t$ statistic is $T = \frac{\bar{X}_1-\bar{X}2 - \Delta_0}{S_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}}$, where $\Delta_0$ is hypothesized difference (often 0) and $S_p$ is the pooled std. dev. The degrees of freedom is $n_1+n_2-2$. If variances not assumed equal, Welch’s $t$-test is used with a modified $\nu$ via the Welch–Satterthwaite formula. Paired $t$-tests compare two measurements on the same subject (or matched subjects) by analyzing the differences $d_i = X{i}^{(1)} - X_{i}^{(2)}$ with a one-sample $t$ on the $d_i$. These tests are staple for small-sample inference on means. For proportions, an analogous test uses the normal approximation (or an exact test via Binomial). For variances, a **chi-squared test** can test a single variance (since $\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma_0^2} \sim \chi^2_{n-1}$ under $H_0$), and an **F-test** can compare two variances $H_0: \sigma_1^2=\sigma_2^2$ (since $S_1^2/S_2^2 \sim F_{n_1-1,,n_2-1}$ under $H_0$).

In all these tests, assumptions (normality, independent observations, etc.) should be checked or justified, especially for small $n$. With large samples, the $t$ and $z$ tests give similar results due to CLT.

**3.5 Chi-Square Tests and ANOVA:** The **chi-square ($\chi^2$) test** is commonly used in two contexts: (a) **Goodness-of-Fit** – testing if categorical data fit a claimed distribution; (b) **Independence in contingency tables**. For goodness-of-fit, suppose we have counts $O_i$ in categories $i=1,\dots,k$ and null hypothesis that probabilities are $p_{i}^{(0)}$. The expected counts are $E_i = N p_{i}^{(0)}$. The chi-square statistic $X^2 = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$ approximately follows $\chi^2_{k-1}$ (or $k-c-1$ if $c$ parameters estimated from data) under $H_0$. If $X^2$ is large (observed counts deviate significantly from expectation), we reject $H_0$. For example, testing if a die is fair ($p_i=1/6$ each, $k=6$) based on $N=150$ rolls: we compute $X^2$ from observed counts and compare to $\chi^2_{5}$ . For contingency tables (r×c table of counts for two categorical variables), $H_0$ is independence. Expected cell counts under independence are $E_{ij} = \frac{(\text{row i total})(\text{col j total})}{N}$. Then $X^2 = \sum_{i,j} \frac{(O_{ij}-E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}$, which under $H_0$ approximately $\sim \chi^2_{(\text{r}-1)(\text{c}-1)}$. This is the **chi-square test of independence**. It can also be used as a test of homogeneity (whether different populations have the same distribution across categories). Chi-square tests require sufficient expected counts (rule of thumb: $E_{ij}\ge 5$ for all cells for validity of $\chi^2$ approximation). If sample sizes are small, an **exact test** like Fisher’s Exact for 2×2 tables is preferred.

**ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** is used to compare means across **more than two groups**. For example, $H_0$: $\mu_1=\mu_2=\mu_3$ vs $H_1$: not all $\mu_i$ equal. ANOVA (one-way) partitions the total variability in data into _between-group_ variability and _within-group_ variability. We compute the **F-statistic**: $F = \frac{\text{Between-group MS}}{\text{Within-group MS}}$. MS = mean square = sum of squares / df. If $H_0$ is true, between and within variances estimate the same quantity and $F$ should be around 1 (with $F$ distribution $F_{df_1,df_2}$ degrees of freedom). If $H_0$ false, between-group variability will exceed within, making $F$ large. Specifically, for $a$ groups and total $N$ observations, $df_1 = a-1$ and $df_2=N-a$. We reject $H_0$ if $F$ is larger than $F_{a-1,,N-a}$ critical value. A significant ANOVA indicates not all means are equal, but further analysis (post-hoc tests) is needed to identify which pairs differ. ANOVA assumes (approximately) normal data in each group and equal variances (homoskedasticity). It’s robust to mild deviations, and there are Welch’s ANOVA for unequal variances and Kruskal-Wallis (non-parametric) if normality fails. ANOVA has extensions: **Two-way ANOVA** for two factors, possibly with interaction; and it connects to regression (ANOVA can be seen as a special case of linear model with categorical predictors).

**3.6 Non-Parametric Tests (Rank-Based, etc.):** When data are not normal or when dealing with ordinal outcomes, **non-parametric tests** offer inference without assuming specific distributions. Examples: The **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test** is a non-parametric analog of the one-sample $t$ (or paired $t$), testing if the median of a symmetric distribution is zero by ranking absolute values and assessing sign symmetry. The **Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test (Mann–Whitney U test)** is a two-sample test for difference in distributions (often used as test for median difference) – it compares ranks of combined samples under $H_0$ that populations are identical. It’s nearly as powerful as $t$ when distributions are shifted and more robust if distributions are non-normal or heavy-tailed. **Kruskal-Wallis** extends Mann-Whitney to $>2$ groups (like non-parametric one-way ANOVA) by comparing mean ranks across groups. **Chi-square tests** we discussed are also non-parametric (distribution-free) for categorical data. **Fisher’s exact test** gives an exact $p$ for 2×2 tables, useful for small counts. **Permutation tests** (a very general approach) construct a test statistic (like difference in means) and compute its distribution by resampling labels among observations – this is free of parametric assumptions and asymptotic approximations, relying on the data itself to infer significance. **Kolmogorov-Smirnov test** can test if a sample comes from a specified distribution or if two samples come from the same distribution (it looks at the maximum difference between empirical CDFs). Non-parametric methods often target medians or distributional differences rather than means, and their _null distributions_ are obtained via combinatorics or permutation arguments rather than formulaic normal/t distributions. They are valuable tools when data don’t meet assumptions required by parametric tests, though sometimes at the cost of power or specificity of what exactly is being tested (e.g. Mann-Whitney is sensitive to distribution shift which may not strictly be a median difference if distributions differ in shape).

**3.7 Power Analysis and Sample Size Considerations:** **Power analysis** involves calculating the probability that a test will correctly reject $H_0$ for a given effect size, significance level, and sample size. It’s used in experimental design to ensure the study is sufficiently sensitive. For instance, in planning a two-sample mean comparison, one might ask: “How large $n$ per group is needed to have 80% power to detect a difference in means of $\delta$ (with known or assumed $\sigma$) at $\alpha=0.05$?” Using the fact that the test statistic under $H_1$ will be normally distributed around some non-zero mean, one can solve for $n$. Specifically, for a two-sided test with known $\sigma$: power $= P_{H_1}{|Z| > z_{1-\alpha/2}}$. Under $H_1: \mu_1-\mu_2 = \delta$, the standardized difference is $\frac{\delta}{\sigma\sqrt{2/n}}$. We find $n$ such that $P(|N(\frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma\sqrt{2}},1)| > z_{1-\alpha/2})=0.8$ (for 80% power), leading to the required $n$. In simpler terms, one computes $\beta = P(\text{Type II error})$ for a given $\delta$, and solves $\beta=0.2$ (power 0.8). Many software have power calculators. For example, for a one-sample $t$ test: if true mean differs from null by $\delta$, $\text{power} = \Phi!\Big( \frac{\sqrt{n}|\delta|}{\sigma} - z_{1-\alpha/2}\Big)$ for two-sided (here $\Phi$ is std normal CDF) . For a difference in proportions, similar calculations use the normal approximation to the proportion’s sampling distribution.

Beyond formulas, one can simulate power by generating data under $H_1$ repeatedly and seeing proportion of rejections. Power analysis is critical: underpowered studies (too small $n$) may frequently miss real effects (Type II errors), whereas extremely large $n$ can detect even tiny, perhaps practically irrelevant differences. Good practice: decide the smallest effect size of practical importance and ensure the study has adequate power for that. Conversely, given a fixed sample size, one can compute the _detectable effect size_ with 80% power. In summary, power analysis helps align study design with research goals and resource constraints, preventing wasted effort on studies that are “too small to succeed” or calibrating expectations for how big an effect needs to be to be confidently detected.

**Practice Problem 3:** You plan a clinical trial comparing a new drug vs placebo on blood pressure reduction. You expect the drug to lower BP by 5 mmHg more on average than placebo, with standard deviation ~8 mmHg (assume equal SD in both groups). (a) Using a two-sample t-test at $\alpha=0.05$ (two-sided), how many patients per group are needed to have 90% power to detect a 5 mmHg difference? (b) If only 30 per group are available, what is the power for detecting a 5 mmHg difference? (c) Explain what “90% power” means in context of this trial. (d) If the observed difference in the trial ends up being 4 mmHg with p=0.12, what conclusions can be drawn, and what could be reasons for not achieving significance?

## **4. Simulation and Monte Carlo Methods**

**4.1 Monte Carlo Simulation Basics:** The term **Monte Carlo methods** refers to using random sampling to approximate mathematical or statistical quantities . At its core, Monte Carlo simulation is about generating a large number of random draws to simulate a process or estimate an expectation. This is especially useful when analytic solutions are difficult or impossible. For example, to estimate $\pi$ via Monte Carlo: throw darts at a unit square and count the fraction that land inside the quarter-circle of radius 1 – with enough random points, that fraction $\approx \pi/4$. More generally, if we want $E[g(X)]$ and can simulate $X$, we can approximate $E[g(X)] \approx \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^M g(x^{(m)})$ for large $M$ by the Law of Large Numbers. Monte Carlo methods are used in integration (numerical integration via random sampling), optimization, probabilistic modeling, etc. . The phrase “Monte Carlo” evokes the idea of a roulette wheel – using randomness to solve deterministic problems. Key to Monte Carlo is the generation of pseudo-random numbers, which in modern computing is done via deterministic algorithms that mimic randomness well.

**Basic Monte Carlo integration example:** Suppose we want to compute $I=\int_0^1 \sqrt{1-x^2} dx$ (which equals $\pi/4$). We can generate $x_1,\dots,x_N \sim \text{Uniform}(0,1)$, and compute $\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}\sqrt{1-x_i^2}$ to approximate $I$. The accuracy (error) will converge as $\sim O(1/\sqrt{N})$ by CLT. Monte Carlo is often not as efficient as deterministic numerical integration in low dimensions, but in high dimensions it shines, as error rate doesn’t degrade badly with dimension (whereas grid methods suffer the “curse of dimensionality” ). Another example: using Monte Carlo to estimate risk in a portfolio by simulating many scenarios for market returns and computing losses each time. Simulation gives flexibility – we can model complex systems (with conditional logic, multiple random inputs) and just let the computer draw many scenarios to empirically approximate distributions of outcomes.

**4.2 Monte Carlo Integration and Law of Large Numbers Demonstration:** Monte Carlo is essentially a computational embodiment of LLN (Section 1.5). If we simulate enough samples, the sample mean converges to the true expectation. For illustration, consider estimating the mean of a distribution by simulation. We know $E[X]$ analytically for some cases, but simulation provides a check. Below is a short Python code using Plotly to visualize convergence of the sample mean (demonstrating LLN):

```
import numpy as np
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Simulate cumulative average of random draws
np.random.seed(0)
data = np.random.exponential(scale=1.0, size=10000)  # exponential with mean 1
cum_avg = np.cumsum(data) / np.arange(1, len(data)+1)
fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(y=cum_avg, mode='lines', name='Cumulative Average'))
fig.add_hline(y=1.0, line_dash="dash", annotation_text="True Mean = 1"))
fig.update_layout(title="Convergence of Sample Mean to True Mean",
                  xaxis_title="Number of samples", yaxis_title="Cumulative average")
fig.show()
```

Running this would show a plot where the cumulative average of an Exp(1) sample starts noisy but settles near 1 as the number of samples grows . This visualizes the LLN: the Monte Carlo estimate of the mean becomes stable with large $N$.

Monte Carlo integration is widely used in high-dimensional integrals (e.g. Bayesian inference integrals for marginal likelihoods, option pricing in finance: expected payoff under risk-neutral measure, etc.). A powerful extension is **importance sampling** (next section), which reduces variance by sampling from a smarter distribution.

**4.3 Importance Sampling:** **Importance sampling** is a variance-reduction technique in Monte Carlo integration . The idea is: to estimate $I = E[h(X)] = \int h(x)f_X(x) dx$, we usually simulate $X$ from its distribution and average $h(X)$. But if $h(X)$ or $f_X(x)$ has regions that contribute a lot to the integral but occur rarely, naive simulation may waste samples. Instead, we draw from a different density $g(x)$ that places more samples where the integrand is large. We then correct the bias by weighting samples by the likelihood ratio $f_X(x)/g(x)$. Specifically, $I = \int h(x)f_X(x)dx = \int h(x)\frac{f_X(x)}{g(x)} g(x) dx = E_g[ h(X),w(X) ]$ where $w(x) = \frac{f_X(x)}{g(x)}$. We simulate $X_1,\dots,X_N \sim g$ and use $\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i} h(X_i)w(X_i)$ as estimator. If $g$ is chosen well (roughly proportional to $|h(x)f_X(x)|$), variance can drop significantly . Essentially, we sample more frequently from important regions and weight down those samples by how more likely they were under $g$ relative to $f$. A classical use: computing tail probabilities. Say $p = P(X>a)$ for some high $a$ might be tiny. Importance sample from a distribution that _forces_ more points in the tail (like a shifted distribution) and weight them appropriately, giving a more accurate estimate of $p$ than waiting for rare events in naive simulation.

Another example: to integrate a function that is sharply peaked, one might choose $g(x)$ concentrating near the peak so that most samples are in the critical region. The formula ensures unbiasedness. However, importance sampling requires knowing $f(x)$ (target) up to a constant and being able to sample from $g$. If $g$ puts zero where $f$ is non-zero, weights blow up – so support of $g$ must cover support of $f$. Also, if $g$ is poorly chosen, variance can be worse (if weights $w(X)$ vary a lot, that’s problematic). So good $g$ choice is key, sometimes done via trial runs or approximations. Importance sampling is fundamental in many areas, including Bayesian computation (e.g., **self-normalized importance sampling** to approximate posterior normalizing constants), and theoretical results such as bridging between distributions. The best scenario is if we can set $g(x) \propto |h(x)f(x)|$; then the integrand becomes roughly constant under $g$, minimizing variance.

**4.4 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) – Metropolis-Hastings:** When direct sampling from a complex posterior or distribution is infeasible, we often use **Markov Chain Monte Carlo** to generate dependent samples that still eventually represent the target distribution . Metropolis-Hastings (MH) is a general MCMC algorithm. It constructs a Markov chain in state space $\theta$ with stationary distribution $\pi(\theta)$ (the desired distribution, e.g. a posterior). The MH procedure: at current state $\theta^{(t)}$, (1) Propose a new state $\theta^_$ from a_ **_proposal distribution_**_$q(\theta^_|\theta^{(t)})$. (2) Compute acceptance probability

\alpha = \min\!\Big(1,\ \frac{\pi(\theta^)\,q(\theta^{(t)}|\theta^)}{\pi(\theta^{(t)})\,q(\theta^*|\theta^{(t)})}\Big)\,.

(3) Generate $u \sim \text{Uniform}(0,1)$. If $u < \alpha$, accept the move (set $\theta^{(t+1)}=\theta^*$); otherwise, reject (stay at $\theta^{(t+1)}=\theta^{(t)}$) . This algorithm satisfies detailed balance and ensures the chain has $\pi(\theta)$ as stationary distribution. Over many iterations (after a “burn-in”), the distribution of $\theta^{(t)}$ is (approximately) $\pi$. We can then treat the sequence as correlated draws from $\pi$, and use sample averages for expectations.

Metropolis-Hastings is very flexible: one must be able to compute $\pi(\theta)$ up to a constant (the ratio cancels the normalizing constant) and sample from a proposal. Common choices: symmetric proposals like $q(\theta^*|\theta^{(t)}) = N(\theta^{(t)}, \sigma^2)$, in which case the acceptance simplifies because $q(\cdot)$ cancels out. This is the **Metropolis algorithm**. If we choose $q$ cleverly, we move through parameter space efficiently. If proposals are too local (small steps), the chain moves slowly (high autocorrelation); too big steps, chain rejects often. **Tuning** of proposal distribution is thus important (for Gaussian proposals, adjusting $\sigma$ to get acceptance rates ~0.2–0.5 is a typical heuristic).

MCMC draws being correlated means effective sample size is lower than actual draws – we often thin or just account for correlation in computing errors. Ensuring convergence (the chain has reached stationary distribution) is critical: one usually discards an initial burn-in period and checks diagnostics (multiple chains with different starting points should mix and agree, $\hat{R}$ statistics near 1 , trace plots showing stationarity, etc.). Variants of MH exist: **Gibbs sampling** (special case where $q$ samples from exact conditional distributions coordinate-wise, acceptance always 1), **Metropolis-adjusted Langevin** (using gradient info in proposal), **Hamiltonian Monte Carlo** (uses momentum and gradients to propose distant points with high acceptance). These advanced methods often achieve better exploration of high-dimensional posteriors.

**4.5 Gibbs Sampling:** Gibbs is a type of MCMC where we cycle through parameters sampling each from its conditional distribution given the rest . It requires that these conditional distributions are known and easy to sample. For example, in a Bayesian hierarchical model with parameters $\theta$ and $\phi$, a Gibbs sampler might alternate sampling $\theta \sim P(\theta|\phi, \text{data})$ and $\phi \sim P(\phi|\theta, \text{data})$. Each conditional-sample step is effectively a MH step with acceptance probability 1 (since we sample exactly from the conditional). Gibbs simplifies multidimensional draws by breaking them into one-dimensional draws. The price is that one needs closed-form conditional posteriors – which often occur in conjugate models. A classic example is simulating from a bivariate distribution when we can derive $P(x|y)$ and $P(y|x)$ easily: e.g. $X|Y=y \sim \text{Pois}(\lambda y)$ and $Y|X=x \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha+x,\ \beta+1)$ form a Gibbs pair. By alternately sampling from these, the $(X,Y)$ chain converges to the joint posterior. Gibbs can also be used on blocks of parameters (blocking strategies to reduce correlation). It’s conceptually simpler – no rejection step – but limited to models with convenient conditionals.

**4.6 Convergence Diagnostics (Gelman-Rubin $\hat{R}$, etc.):** When running MCMC, verifying that the chain has converged to the target distribution is vital. One common diagnostic is the **Gelman-Rubin $\hat{R}$ statistic** . The idea: run multiple chains from dispersed starting values. For each parameter (or scalar summary) look at between-chain variance $B$ and within-chain variance $W$. If chains have converged to the same distribution, these should be about equal. $\hat{R}$ (sometimes called the potential scale reduction factor) is defined roughly as $\hat{R} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{V}}{W}}$, where $\hat{V}$ is a weighted average of $W$ and $B$ (more precisely $\hat{R} = \sqrt{\frac{W + B}{W} \frac{df}{df-2}}$ in one formulation). If $\hat{R} \approx 1$, convergence is indicated; if $\hat{R} > 1.1$ or so, the chains are giving inconsistent results and more iterations are needed . Updated versions (sometimes called “split-$\hat{R}$”) improve sensitivity by splitting chains and comparing first vs second halves. Another metric is **effective sample size (ESS)**: how many independent samples worth of information our autocorrelated chain contains. Low ESS indicates high correlation and possibly slow mixing. One can also inspect **trace plots**: a stable “caterpillar-like” trace (stationary with no apparent trend) suggests convergence, whereas drifts or sticking indicate issues. **Autocorrelation plots** can show how quickly the chain forgets its state (fast decay is good). Some use **geweke tests** or **Heidelberger-Welch** diagnostics that check if early and late parts of chain have same mean (should not differ if converged). It’s often more art than science – multiple diagnostics and practical judgment are used. Running very long chains or multiple shorter chains helps. Modern MCMC frameworks (Stan, PyMC3, etc.) implement $\hat{R}$ and ESS by default and will flag if $\hat{R}$ significantly above 1 or ESS very low .

A practical tip: if diagnostics suggest non-convergence, one might need to run longer, or reparameterize the model (some parameterizations mix slowly), or use a better sampler (e.g. Hamiltonian MC instead of random-walk MH). Sometimes multimodal distributions cause chains to get stuck in one mode; in such cases, specialized methods (simulated annealing, parallel tempering) might be needed to ensure thorough exploration. Ultimately, convergence diagnostics aim to give confidence that samples collected can be treated as draws from the true target distribution, so subsequent inference (means, credible intervals, etc.) is valid.

**Practice Problem 4:** You are using MCMC to sample from a posterior with two highly correlated parameters $(\theta_1,\theta_2)$. (a) Explain why a simple Metropolis random walk might mix slowly in this case. (b) Suggest a strategy to improve mixing (e.g. a different proposal covariance or a reparameterization). (c) If you run 4 parallel chains and get $\hat{R}\approx 1.3$ for some parameters after 1000 iterations, what does that indicate? What steps could you take? (d) After a long run, you have 10,000 correlated samples from the posterior. Describe how you would estimate the posterior mean and an associated Monte Carlo standard error for that estimate.

## **5. Causal Inference**

**5.1 Causation vs Correlation; Counterfactual Reasoning:** _Correlation does not imply causation_ is the mantra that motivates the field of causal inference. **Causal inference** is about identifying the effect of changing one variable (treatment/exposure) on another (outcome) in a setting often complicated by confounding factors. A **causal effect**answers a counterfactual question: “What would $Y$ be if $X$ had been different, holding all else equal?” **Counterfactual reasoning** imagines alternate worlds – e.g., what a patient’s blood pressure would have been _had_ they received a drug vs _had_ they not. Only one of these outcomes is observed for each individual (you either treat or not, not both) – this is the fundamental problem of causal inference (missing counterfactuals). Tools like the **potential outcomes framework** (Neyman-Rubin) and **structural causal models** (Pearl) formalize this. Essentially, to claim $X$ causes $Y$, we want that if we intervene on $X$, $Y$ changes as a result. This is stronger than correlation, which could arise due to confounding or reverse causation. For example, ice cream sales correlate with drowning deaths – but increasing ice cream consumption won’t cause more drownings; temperature is a confounder causing both to increase. Causal inference attempts to identify and adjust for such confounders or use designs that mitigate them (randomization, etc.).

Counterfactual notation: In potential outcomes terms, each unit $i$ has $Y_i(0)$ and $Y_i(1)$ – outcomes if untreated or treated . The _individual treatment effect_ is $Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)$, but we only ever see one of $Y_i(0)$ or $Y_i(1)$. We target population quantities like the **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)** = $E[Y(1)-Y(0)]$. Observationally, we see $Y_i = Y_i(T_i) = T_i Y_i(1) + (1-T_i) Y_i(0)$, where $T_i$ is treatment indicator. Without randomization, $T_i$ might be related to $Y_i(0)$ or $Y_i(1)$ (confounding). **Randomized experiments** get around this by making $T$ independent of potential outcomes (so treated and untreated groups are comparable on average). In observational studies, one uses methods like regression adjustment, matching, or instrumental variables to simulate a random assignment and estimate causal effects.

**5.2 Potential Outcomes Framework (Rubin/Neyman):** The **Rubin Causal Model (RCM)** defines causal effects via potential outcomes . For each unit (person, etc.), define $Y(0)$ and $Y(1)$ as above. The treatment effect for that unit is $\tau = Y(1)-Y(0)$. The fundamental problem: we can’t observe both for the same unit. However, if we have a population and an assumption like **SUTVA** (stable unit treatment value assumption – no interference between units and well-defined treatment), then under random assignment of treatment, the difference in average outcomes between treated and control equals the ATE. More formally, with $n$ units, ATE $= E[Y(1)]-E[Y(0)] = E[Y|T=1] - E[Y|T=0]$ if $T$ is randomized (or conditional on covariates, if unconfoundedness holds: $T \perp (Y(0),Y(1))$ given $X$). The potential outcomes approach encourages thinking in terms of **causal estimands** (like ATE, ATT – average treatment effect on the treated, etc.) and what assumptions are needed to identify them from data. It emphasizes design: e.g., if randomization is not possible, maybe we assume **selection on observables** (all confounders measured) and apply propensity score methods (next section). Or we seek an **instrumental variable** that affects treatment but not outcomes except through treatment (section 5.6). The key insight is that causation is a missing data problem: one potential outcome is missing for each individual, and all causal inference methods try to recover those missing pieces via assumptions or designs.

For instance, consider a job training program: $Y(1)$ = earnings if trained, $Y(0)$ = earnings if not. People who choose training might be more motivated (so $Y(0)$ for them would be higher than average too), so a naive comparison of trainees vs non-trainees will be biased. One approach: measure covariates like education, previous earnings, etc., and adjust (via regression or matching) to mimic a randomized experiment (propensity score matching would pair a trained individual with a similar untrained individual, hoping their $Y(0)$ would be similar). If done well and if all confounders are accounted for, one can estimate ATE or ATT.

**5.3 Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and Structural Causal Models:** **DAGs** are graphical representations of causal relationships between variables . Nodes are variables, directed edges $A \to B$ indicate $A$ is a direct cause of $B$ (with all relevant variables in the graph). Acyclic means no feedback loops (no cycles). DAGs help visualize assumptions about data-generating process and identify confounding paths. For example, a simple DAG: $X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y$ (here $Z$ is a common cause, a confounder of $X$ and $Y$). In this graph, there is a non-causal association between $X$ and $Y$ due to the backdoor path $X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y$. To get the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$, one must block that path (e.g., condition on $Z$ or adjust for it). This is the logic of **backdoor criterion**(Pearl): a set of covariates $S$ satisfies the backdoor criterion if $S$ blocks all paths from $X$ to $Y$ that go backwards into $X$ (i.e. confounding paths), without blocking any causal paths. If so, then $P(Y|do(X))$ (causal effect of setting $X$) equals $P(Y|X,S)$ (observational, adjusting for $S$). The $do(X)$ notation indicates an **intervention**(setting $X$ externally) .

Structural Causal Models (SCM) formalize DAGs with structural equations: each node = function of its parents + error. For instance, an SCM might be: $Z = U_Z$; $X = f(Z, U_X)$; $Y = g(X,Z,U_Y)$, where $U$ are exogenous noise variables. This yields a DAG $Z \to X \to Y$ and $Z \to Y$ (assuming $Y$ depends on $Z$ too, as written). In Pearl’s framework, the causal effect $P(Y|do(X=x))$ can be computed by **do-calculus** or by modifying the graph (remove incoming arrows into $X$, set $X=x$, propagate effects). With the DAG, one can apply rules: e.g., if we want $P(Y|do(X))$, find a backdoor set to condition on. In the example $Z \to X \to Y \leftarrow Z$ (where $Z$ influences both $X$ and $Y$), adjusting for $Z$ blocks the confounding. If a variable is a collider (two arrows into it, like $A \to C \leftarrow B$), conditioning on it _opens_ a path (collider bias), which DAGs clearly show. For instance, in a study of a treatment $X$ and outcome $Y$, if researchers stratify on an intermediate outcome or a common effect, it can induce false associations.

DAGs thus aid in deciding what to control for and what not to. They encode assumptions (you can’t tell causality from data alone; you assert causal structure, then see implications). The **structural causal model** approach (Pearl) with DAGs is complementary to potential outcomes (Rubin); they can be translated. Pearl’s $do$-operator and rules give criteria for identification of causal queries (like front-door, back-door criteria).

**5.4 Treatment Effect Estimation Methods:** Beyond conceptual frameworks, practical causal inference uses various statistical methods to estimate effects from observational data. Key scenario: estimate ATE or ATT of a binary treatment $T$ on outcome $Y$ with confounders $X$. If we assume **unconfoundedness**: $T \perp (Y(0),Y(1)) | X$ (all confounders measured), we can use methods like:

- **Regression adjustment:** regress $Y$ on $T$ and $X$. Coefficient of $T$ (possibly adjusting for $X$ non-linearly) estimates causal effect if model is correct.
    
- **Stratification or Matching:** compare treated vs control within strata of $X$ (or match each treated unit with a similar control based on $X$). If $X$ high-dimensional, exact matching is hard; one uses **Propensity Score matching** (section 5.5).
    
- **Weighting (IPTW):** weight each unit by inverse of $P(T|X)$ (the **propensity score**); this creates a pseudo-population where treatment is independent of $X$. Then a weighted difference in means consistently estimates ATE .
    
- **Doubly robust methods:** combine propensity score weighting and outcome regression. For example, **Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighted (AIPW)** estimators: $ \hat{\tau} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i \Big[\frac{T_i Y_i}{e(X_i)} - \frac{(1-T_i)Y_i}{1-e(X_i)} + \big(1-\frac{T_i}{e(X_i)}\big)\hat{m}_1(X_i) - \big(1-\frac{1-T_i}{1-e(X_i)}\big)\hat{m}_0(X_i)\Big]$, where $e(X)=P(T=1|X)$ and $\hat{m}_1,\hat{m}_0$ are estimated outcome models for treated and control. These give unbiased estimates if either the propensity model or outcome model is correct (hence doubly robust).
    
- **Instrumental Variables (section 5.6)**: when unconfoundedness fails, but an instrument exists.
    
- **Difference-in-Differences (section 5.7)**: for causal inference in panel data with a clear intervention time.
    

Choosing a method depends on context: If you trust you measured all confounders, propensity score methods or regression can work. If hidden confounders exist, one needs instruments or natural experiments.

**5.5 Propensity Score Matching:** The **propensity score** $e(X)=P(T=1|X)$ is the probability of treatment given covariates . Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) showed that if treatment is unconfounded given $X$, then treatment is also unconfounded given $e(X)$. In other words, conditioning on a scalar $e(X)$ is as good as conditioning on the whole $X$ . This is powerful because it reduces dimensionality: rather than match on many $X$ variables, we can match (or subclassify or weight) on the propensity score. **Propensity score matching** pairs or groups treated and control units with similar $e(X)$ . For instance, you compute each unit’s $e_i = \hat{P}(T=1|X_i)$ via a logistic regression. Then for each treated person, find one (or several) control(s) with close propensity score. Then estimate ATT by the average outcome difference within pairs. The logic is that matched units have similar covariates on average, approximating a randomized block.

Alternatively, **stratification on propensity**: divide $e(X)$ into bins (quantiles) and within each bin, compare outcomes (then average). Or **inverse probability weighting**: weight treated by $1/e(X)$ and control by $1/(1-e(X))$ to create a weighted sample where covariate distributions are balanced between treated and control . Checking **balance** after matching/weighting is crucial: one examines if the distribution of $X$ is similar for treated and control in matched sample (standardized mean differences should be small, etc.). If not balanced, the propensity model might need interactions or non-linear terms.

Propensity scores act as a summary of covariates relevant to selection into treatment. They don’t guarantee causal identification (you still need no hidden confounders assumption – _ignorability_). But they make the process of controlling for confounders more tractable, especially when $X$ is high-dimensional and sample sizes are limited . One caution: propensity models shouldn’t include post-treatment variables or instruments (just true confounders). And extreme propensity scores (near 0 or 1) can cause large variance (in weights, for example). Trimming or modeling to avoid that is common.

**5.6 Instrumental Variables:** When we suspect unmeasured confounders, **Instrumental Variables (IV)** can sometimes salvage causal inference. An **instrument** $Z$ is a variable that affects the treatment $X$ but has no direct effect on outcome $Y$ except through $X$ . Formally, (1) $Z$ is correlated with $X$ (relevance condition) , and (2) $Z$ is independent of any confounders of $X$ and $Y$, and does not appear in the structural error for $Y$ (exclusion restriction) . If these hold, $Z$ provides random-like variation in $X$ that can be used to estimate causal effect. Intuition: $Z$ “pushes” $X$ around in a manner unrelated to confounders, mimicking a randomized trial for the part of $X$ variation explained by $Z$.

A classic example: $X$ = years of education, $Y$ = earnings. Unobserved ability can confound this (more able individuals both get more education and higher earnings). As an IV, researchers have used quarter of birth. Quarter of birth influences compulsory schooling length (due to school start age laws) – e.g., those born just after cutoff have to wait an extra year to start, thus might get less education on average. Quarter should not directly affect earnings (assuming no seasonal effect on ability, etc.), making it a valid instrument (arguably). Using IV regression, one finds how quarter affects education (first stage), and how quarter (via affecting education) affects earnings (reduced form), then forms estimate of effect of education on earnings .

In practice, **Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)** is the usual IV estimator: First stage: regress $X$ on $Z$ (and other exogenous controls) to get $\hat{X}$, the part of $X$ predicted by instrument. Second stage: regress $Y$ on $\hat{X}$ to estimate causal effect. Algebraically, $\beta_{IV} = \frac{\text{Cov}(Y,Z)}{\text{Cov}(X,Z)}$ in simplest case (one instrument) . This is consistent for causal effect under assumptions, whereas OLS of $Y$ on $X$ would be biased by confounders.

Important conditions: The instrument must be relevant (Cov$(X,Z)\neq 0$) – a weak instrument (weak correlation) leads to imprecise and possibly biased estimates in finite samples . The instrument must be exogenous: essentially $Z \perp \varepsilon_Y$ (no direct path $Z \to Y$ except through $X$) . This exclusion restriction is untestable (requires domain knowledge). Sometimes multiple instruments are used (just more $Z$ variables, forming an over-identified system, allowing a test of instrument consistency if one assumes all but one are valid).

Instrumental variables estimate a particular causal effect: if treatment effects vary, 2SLS estimates the **Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE)** for compliers (units whose $X$ changes if $Z$ changes) . For instance, in schooling example, LATE = return to education for those whose education was affected by quarter of birth (compliers). Those who would get lots of education regardless (always-takers) or those who drop out early regardless (never-takers) are not affected by $Z$, so instrument doesn’t capture their outcomes.

**5.7 Difference-in-Differences:** **Diff-in-Diff (DiD)** is a method for causal inference in longitudinal (panel) data when a policy/treatment affects one group but not another, at a specific time . It differences out common trends. Basic setup: you have two groups (treatment and control) and two time periods (before and after). Treatment group gets intervention in period 2, control does not. We observe average outcomes: $Y_{treat, pre}$, $Y_{treat, post}$, $Y_{ctrl, pre}$, $Y_{ctrl, post}$. The naive difference post between groups $(Y_{treat,post} - Y_{ctrl,post})$ may reflect both treatment effect and any pre-existing difference. Diff-in-diff computes *_(Difference in outcomes between groups after) minus (Difference in outcomes between groups before)_ . Equivalently $(Y_{treat,post}-Y_{treat,pre}) - (Y_{ctrl,post}-Y_{ctrl,pre})$. This differences out the baseline gap and any time trend common to both groups . The key assumption is the **Parallel Trends Assumption**: in absence of treatment, the average outcome in treatment group would have changed over time the same as in control group . Under that, the difference in differences is an unbiased estimator of treatment’s causal effect on outcome.

In regression form, one often runs: $Y_{it} = \alpha + \beta \text{Treated}_i + \gamma \text{Post}_t + \delta (\text{Treated}_i \times \text{Post}_t) + \varepsilon_{it}$. Here $\delta$ is the DiD estimator . $\beta$ picks up any constant difference between groups, $\gamma$ picks up any common time change, and $\delta$ picks up the extra change for treated beyond what control experienced – which is the treatment effect if parallel trends holds.

Example: Suppose a new law (treatment) in state A in 2020, and state B is control with no law. If state A’s outcome rose 5 units from 2019 to 2021, and state B’s rose 3 units in same period, DiD would estimate effect = $5-3 = 2$ units. This assumes that in absence of the law, A would also have risen 3 (like B). One can extend DiD to more groups and times (multi-period DiD), though inference gets complex if treatment timing varies (recent advances handle staggered adoption and issues around heterogeneous effects). One can also include covariates or use matching to find a better control group. But the crux is controlling for time trends and constant group differences non-parametrically via differencing.

DiD is popular in policy analysis (minimum wage effects, etc.) because it uses before-after and control-treatment comparisons in observational data. One must check if pre-treatment trends look similar (an indication parallel trends may hold) . If not, the estimate might capture those trend differences rather than treatment.

**Practice Problem 5:** A new traffic law was implemented in State X in 2018 aimed at reducing accidents. State Y has similar characteristics but no law change (it’s our control). We have accident rates for both states for 2016 (pre) and 2019 (post). Outline how you’d estimate the law’s effect using difference-in-differences. What assumption must hold? If State X had a higher decrease in accidents than State Y, how do we attribute the difference to the law versus other factors? What checks or data would strengthen our causal claim?

## **6. Machine Learning Algorithms**

**6.1 Supervised Learning Overview:** _Supervised learning_ involves learning a function $f: \mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{Y}$ from labeled examples $(x_i, y_i)$, such that $f(x)$ predicts $y$ for new data. If $y$ is continuous, it’s a **regression** problem; if $y$ is categorical, a **classification** problem. The goal is typically to generalize well to unseen data (avoid overfitting). The fundamental trade-off is bias vs variance: simpler models may be biased (can’t capture complex patterns), whereas very complex models have low bias but high variance (overfit noise). Techniques like cross-validation help choose models and tune hyperparameters to balance this. We often split data into training set (to fit model) and test set (to evaluate generalization). Key algorithms span from linear models to very complex non-linear ones like neural networks and ensemble methods. We’ll cover a spectrum: **Linear Regression, Logistic Regression**(simple, interpretable), **Naive Bayes** (probabilistic, fast), **Decision Trees** (interpretable but can overfit), **k-NN** (simple but computationally heavy at prediction), **Support Vector Machines** (powerful for medium-sized data, uses kernel trick for non-linear decision boundaries), **Ensembles** like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting (often top performance), and **Neural Networks/Deep Learning** (state-of-art for many tasks, at cost of interpretability and training time). We’ll also discuss _regularization_ (Ridge, Lasso) which is crucial to prevent overfitting by penalizing model complexity .

Each algorithm has assumptions: e.g., linear models assume linear relationships (which might be mitigated by feature engineering or using polynomial features), Naive Bayes assumes feature independence given class , SVMs implicitly assume data can be separated in some high-dimensional space (via a kernel). In practice, one tries several and uses model selection criteria or cross-validation to pick the best for the task.

**6.2 Linear Regression (OLS Derivation):** _Linear regression_ assumes $y \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p$ (linear combination of features). The parameters $\beta$ are typically estimated by **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**: choose $\hat{\beta}$ minimizing the sum of squared residuals $\sum_i (y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_j \beta_j x_{ij})^2$. Solving the normal equations $X^T X \hat{\beta} = X^T y$ yields $\hat{\beta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y$ (assuming full rank $X$). This is the analytic solution for OLS . Geometrically, it projects $y$ onto column space of $X$. The fitted values are $\hat{y}=X\hat{\beta}$, the orthogonal projection of $y$. Under the standard assumptions (linear model is correct, errors $\varepsilon$ have mean 0, constant variance $\sigma^2$, uncorrelated, often normally distributed), $\hat{\beta}$ is unbiased and has variance $(X^TX)^{-1}\sigma^2$. By Gauss-Markov Theorem, OLS is the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) . If errors are normal, $\hat{\beta}$ is also the MLE and follows a multivariate normal. This facilitates inference: individual $\beta_j$ can be t-tested, CI: $\beta_j \pm t_{n-p-1,0.975}, \text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_j)$. We can assess fit by $R^2$ (fraction of variance explained).

If model assumptions don’t hold, OLS is still a projection, but might not yield meaningful inferences. Diagnostics (residual plots, checking normality, heteroscedasticity tests) are done. For multiple collinear features, $X^TX$ becomes near-singular, leading to unstable $\hat{\beta}$ (high variance). **Regularization** (below) helps by adding a penalty. Linear regression is often a starting baseline due to simplicity and interpretability of coefficients (each $\beta_j$ = change in $y$ per unit change in $x_j$, holding others constant). It’s also relatively fast to compute (especially with modern linear algebra libraries, even very large $n,p$ can be handled).

**6.3 Logistic Regression:** Despite its name, logistic regression is used for **classification** (binary, or generalized to multi-class). It models the **log-odds** of the positive class as a linear function of features . For binary outcome $Y\in{0,1}$, $\displaystyle \log \frac{P(Y=1|x)}{P(Y=0|x)} = \beta_0 + \beta^T x$ . Equivalently, $P(Y=1|x) = \sigma(\beta_0 + \beta^T x)$ where $\sigma(z) = 1/(1+e^{-z})$ is the **sigmoid** function. This ensures predictions are in [0,1]. Logistic regression is fitted typically by **maximum likelihood** (no closed form like OLS, so use iterative algorithms like Newton-Raphson or gradient descent). The likelihood for independent data is $\prod_i p_i^{y_i}(1-p_i)^{1-y_i}$ (where $p_i=\sigma(\beta_0+\beta^Tx_i)$). We maximize log-likelihood $\sum_i [y_i \log p_i + (1-y_i)\log(1-p_i)]$. The partial derivatives yield normal equations that are non-linear in $\beta$, solved iteratively. The result is a discriminative classifier: it gives $P(Y=1|x)$ estimates. Predictions: often classify as 1 if $P(Y=1|x)>0.5$ (or another threshold).

Logistic regression is popular for its probabilistic outputs and interpretability: $\exp(\beta_j)$ is the _odds ratio_ for a one-unit increase in $x_j$, holding others constant . E.g., if $\beta_j=0.7$, then odds of $Y=1$ multiply by $e^{0.7}\approx2.01$ for each 1-unit increase in $x_j$. It assumes log-odds linearity; interactions or non-linear effects must be manually included via features. It handles categorical features via dummy encoding easily. Being a generalized linear model (GLM with logit link), logistic regression allows using deviance (likelihood ratio) tests for significance, etc. For evaluation, accuracy is one metric, but because it gives probabilities, we often use **AUC-ROC** or **precision-recall** for imbalanced data. Logistic regression can be extended: **multinomial logistic** (softmax function for multi-class), **ordinal logistic** for ordered categories, etc. It’s a workhorse for many real-world classification tasks where interpretability and speed are valued (e.g., credit scoring, medical prediction). With many features, regularization (like L1/L2 penalty) is commonly added to avoid overfitting.

**6.4 Regularization: Ridge and Lasso:** Regularization adds a penalty to the loss function to discourage complex models (typically large coefficients). It fights overfitting by biasing estimates towards smaller magnitude. In regression context, **Ridge (L2) regularization** adds $\lambda \sum_j \beta_j^2$ to the OLS cost, and **Lasso (L1) regularization**adds $\lambda \sum_j |\beta_j|$ . The _tuning parameter_ $\lambda \ge 0$ controls the strength (picked often by cross-validation). Ridge solution is $\hat{\beta}^{ridge} = (X^TX + \lambda I)^{-1} X^T y$, a shrinkage of OLS solution . It doesn’t set coefficients to zero, but makes them smaller. Lasso, due to the absolute value penalty, yields sparse solutions – it can drive some $\beta_j$ exactly to 0, performing variable selection . This is a big advantage when you suspect many features are irrelevant: Lasso will remove them, yielding a simpler model .

In practice, one might use **Elastic Net**, which is a combination of L1 and L2 penalties, to get a mix of ridge and lasso benefits. Regularization isn’t just for linear models: logistic regression typically uses L2 or L1 as well (especially in high-dimensional text classification, etc.). For neural networks, weight decay is analogous to ridge on weights.

Regularization effectively imposes a prior that coefficients are near zero (in Bayesian view: ridge ~ Gaussian prior, lasso ~ Laplace prior on coefficients). It reduces variance at cost of some bias, often improving predictive performance on test data (since OLS or MLE can overfit training data, especially if $p$ is large or multicollinearity exists). Lasso’s ability to select features makes it useful in high-dimensional problems (p >> n), e.g., genomics. However, Lasso can be unstable when features are highly correlated (it might arbitrarily pick one of them). Ridge tends to share weight among correlated features.

Tuning $\lambda$ is critical: $\lambda=0$ recovers OLS, $\lambda \to \infty$ drives all $\beta$ to 0. Cross-validation finds an optimum $\lambda$ that minimizes validation error. The resulting models often have better generalization. There’s also a **bias-variance trade-off** knob: as $\lambda$ increases, bias rises (we underfit more), variance drops, typically improving test error up to a point then worsening (the classic U-shape).

**6.5 Naive Bayes Classifier:** **Naive Bayes** is a simple probabilistic classifier that applies Bayes’ theorem with a strong independence assumption among features . For class $C$ and features $X = (X_1,\dots,X_d)$, the classifier uses

P(C=k \mid X_1=x_1,\dots,X_d=x_d) \propto P(C=k)\, \prod_{j=1}^d P(X_j = x_j \mid C=k)\,.

The **naive assumption** is that features are conditionally independent given the class , which greatly simplifies computing the likelihood as a product of marginals. Although this assumption is often violated, Naive Bayes still works surprisingly well in many domains (especially text classification where features might be word counts – independence is not true but NB still often accurate and very fast/training). During training, we estimate $P(C=k)$ from class frequencies, and $P(X_j|C=k)$ from class-conditional frequencies (e.g., if $X_j$ is categorical, just counts; if continuous often assume a simple distribution like Gaussian – yielding **Gaussian Naive Bayes**). For text (bag-of-words features), $P(\text{word} | \text{class})$ can be estimated with smoothing. At prediction, we compute the posterior for each class (and often pick the argmax class).

Despite being “dumb” (it ignores feature correlations), NB often comes close to more sophisticated classifiers, especially when there are many features that each individually correlate with the class. It is a **generative model** (learns $P(X|C)$) as opposed to logistic regression’s discriminative approach. NB is very fast to train (just counts) and to predict. It requires very little data to estimate probabilities if features are simple. A drawback is if features are redundant or highly correlated, NB effectively “double counts” evidence, overweighting it. But in high dimensions, the independence assumption can be a reasonable approximation.

For instance, in spam filtering, features might be presence of certain words. NB assumes that, given an email is spam or not, the occurrences of different words are independent. Not true exactly, but it yields an easy way to combine word evidence. A word like “Viagra” strongly suggests spam, NB will multiply probabilities for each such indicative word. NB yields _calibrated_ probabilities poorly (because of independence assumption, probabilities can be overconfident), but as a classifier (0/1 decisions) it’s often decent. If one needs probabilities, one might calibrate NB output via Platt scaling or isotonic regression.

**6.6 Decision Trees and Overfitting/Pruning:** A **Decision Tree** is a flowchart-like structure where internal nodes test a feature (e.g., “$X_j < t$?”), branches split data based on the test, and leaf nodes output a prediction (class label or regression value). They are learned by recursively partitioning the data. For classification, a typical algorithm (like CART) chooses a split that maximizes improvement in purity (e.g., uses **Gini impurity** or **information gain** as criterion) . Gini impurity for a node = $\sum_k p_k(1-p_k)$ (probability of misclassification if we pick a label at random from node). A split is chosen that best separates classes, reducing impurity . For regression, splits minimize variance (mean squared error) within nodes.

Trees are very interpretable: one can follow a path and see conditions leading to a prediction. However, **unpruned decision trees can overfit heavily** – they can create many branches to perfectly fit training data (even noise) . This leads to poor generalization. To mitigate, we either stop growing the tree earlier (by requiring a minimum number of samples per leaf, maximum depth, etc.) or **prune** it after fully growing. **Pruning** can be done by complexity cost: e.g., CART uses a cost-complexity parameter $\alpha$ and prunes subtrees that don’t sufficiently reduce error beyond a threshold. Alternatively, cross-validation can determine the optimal tree size (number of leaves).

Even pruned, single decision trees often are not the most accurate models, but they form the base of powerful ensemble methods (Random Forests, Boosting). They can capture non-linear interactions easily (especially important in high dimensions – trees do automatic variable selection and interaction detection). But they tend to be unstable: small data changes can change the structure significantly (high variance learner). Ensembles average many trees to smooth that out (see 6.9, 6.10).

**Overfitting** in trees is evident if you let them grow until each leaf is pure (classification) or has one sample (regression): training error becomes zero, but test error likely is high unless data truly has that deterministic structure. **Regularization** of trees includes setting max depth, min samples per leaf, or requiring splits have a certain info gain. For example, requiring at least 5 samples per leaf prevents splitting outliers into separate leaves. Many tree implementations also have an option to prune after training (C4.5 algorithm prunes using error-based or rule-based methods). Another technique: **Ensemble averaging** (like bagging) drastically improves stability and generalization by averaging many overfit trees.

In summary, trees are useful for interpretability and handling of mixed data types (no need to normalize or dummy-code, can handle missing values, etc.), but one must control complexity. Modern use often directly goes to tree ensembles for performance, but understanding single trees is still important for explainability.

**6.7 k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):** k-NN is a simple **instance-based** learning method: to predict for a new point $x$, find the $k$ closest training points (neighbors) to $x$ (under some distance metric, typically Euclidean), and then predict by majority vote (classification) or average (regression) of their labels. No explicit model is trained; the “model” is essentially the stored data. k-NN is **non-parametric** and can approximate very complex functions given enough data. It naturally handles multi-class and multi-label tasks (just count neighbors’ labels). It has one hyperparameter: $k$ (and maybe distance metric, and sometimes a weighting scheme where closer neighbors have higher vote weight).

A small $k$ (like 1) means low bias but high variance – basically memorizing training data (1-NN has training error = 0 but likely overfits noise). Large $k$ increases bias (prediction is smoothed among many points, potentially ignoring fine structure) but reduces variance. Typically one chooses $k$ via cross-validation (e.g., $k=5$ or $10$ are common best choices). Another issue: the curse of dimensionality – in high dimensions, distance metrics become less meaningful (all points are “far” in some sense, nearest might still be not very near). Often some form of feature weighting or dimension reduction is needed. Also, if scales differ, we need to normalize features or use an appropriate metric.

k-NN’s computational cost can be high at prediction: naive search is $O(n)$ per query (which is fine for small/medium data, but for very large n, approximate neighbor search or spatial data structures like KD-trees or ball trees are used to speed it up). There are libraries that handle these efficiently.

k-NN can handle multi-modal distributions well (no averaging assumptions), and naturally adapts to the data density (predictions are locally defined). It is often quite effective if data has a lot of samples and not too many features. But it doesn’t produce a human-interpretable model or coefficients – it’s all in the data. Additionally, storing and searching in the entire training set can be memory and time expensive.

A variant: weighted k-NN, where each neighbor’s vote is weighted by 1/distance (or other kernel). This can improve smoothness of predictions. Another extension: using different distance for categorical features (Hamming distance) or even learned distances (through metric learning).

**6.8 Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** SVM is a powerful classifier (also extended to regression as SVR) that finds the **maximum-margin hyperplane** separating classes . In the simplest linear SVM for binary classification, if data are linearly separable, there are many hyperplanes that can separate classes; SVM picks the one that maximizes the margin (distance between hyperplane and nearest points on either side) . The intuition is that a larger margin gives better generalization (by VC theory). If data are not perfectly separable, SVM introduces slack variables to allow some misclassifications, controlled by a penalty parameter $C$ (or conversely a regularization parameter $\lambda=1/C$). The primal optimization: minimize $\frac{1}{2}|\mathbf{w}|^2 + C \sum_i \xi_i$ subject to $y_i(\mathbf{w}\cdot x_i + b) \ge 1-\xi_i$, $\xi_i \ge 0$. This quadratic program is convex; the solution has w as a combination of a subset of training points (the **support vectors** are those on or within margin that bear the weight of defining the boundary) . SVM’s predictive model is $f(x) = \text{sign}(\sum_{SV} \alpha_i y_i K(x_i, x) + b)$ where $K$ is the kernel.

**Kernel trick:** One of SVM’s most powerful aspects: we can implicitly map data to a high-dimensional (possibly infinite-dimensional) feature space via a kernel function $K(x,z) = \phi(x)\cdot \phi(z)$, and find a linear separator there . Common kernels: **Gaussian RBF** $K(x,z) = \exp(-\gamma |x-z|^2)$, **Polynomial** $K(x,z)=(x\cdot z + c)^d$, **Sigmoid kernel** (like a neural tanh). The kernel trick means the algorithm only uses inner products, which we replace with kernel, so we avoid explicitly computing $\phi(x)$ coordinates. This allows very complex non-linear boundaries. RBF SVM is a universal approximator in theory.

SVMs often deliver high accuracy, especially on medium-sized datasets with clear margins. They are less effective on very large datasets (scaling is roughly $O(n^2)$ for training in naive form, though SMO and other decomposition methods can handle tens of thousands of points, but millions might be an issue compared to, say, stochastic gradient descent training for logistic regression). Also, if $p$ is huge and $n$ is small, linear SVM might overfit unless regularization is strong or dimensionality reduced.

Choosing kernel and hyperparameters ($C$ and kernel parameters like $\gamma$ for RBF) is done via cross-validation or grid search. A too-large $C$ means low regularization (trying to classify everything correctly, risking overfit), too small $C$ means more margin at cost of errors (underfit perhaps). For RBF, $\gamma$ controls kernel width: high $\gamma$ means kernel is very localized – can lead to very wiggly decision boundary (overfitting if $C$ also large), small $\gamma$ means kernel nearly linear.

SVM output as distances to hyperplane can be turned into calibrated probabilities via Platt scaling (logistic reg on outputs), but inherently SVM doesn’t give probability, just decision and margin.

**6.9 Ensemble Methods: Bagging, Random Forests:** Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve predictive performance. The mantra is that a diverse set of weak learners, when aggregated, can produce a strong learner (reducing variance and possibly bias). **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)** is a simple but powerful ensemble technique : we generate many bootstrap samples from training data (each sample is drawn with replacement of size n), train a base model on each, and average their predictions (for classification, majority vote). Bagging’s primary effect: reduce variance of unstable learners like decision trees . Each model sees a slightly different dataset, so their errors are somewhat uncorrelated, and averaging cancels out noise. Bagging works best with high-variance low-bias models (like fully-grown trees). It’s less beneficial for stable models (like linear regression on a large dataset yields similar fits on different bootstraps).

A **Random Forest** is an extension of bagging applied to decision trees with an additional twist: random feature selection at each split . In a Random Forest, each tree is grown on a bootstrap sample (like bagging), and at each node, instead of considering all $p$ features to find the best split, we randomly select a subset of $m$ features (e.g. $m=\sqrt{p}$ for classification) . This decorrelates the trees further so that the average has lower variance. The resulting forest often significantly outperforms a single tree and plain bagging without feature randomness , especially when some features are very strong predictors – if not for feature bagging, all trees would pick that feature first and be correlated.

Random forests are among the most popular out-of-the-box classifiers/regressors: they handle default variable importance measures, are fairly robust to hyperparameters (only a couple matter: number of trees (large enough to stabilize, often 100-1000), number of features to sample at each split, tree depth (often let them fully grow and rely on averaging to generalize, though some modest pruning can help speed)), and they can model non-linear interactions well. They do not overfit as more trees are added (error converges to a limit as forest size grows) – more trees just reduce variance to that limit.

They also give useful insights: e.g. **feature importance** by seeing how much splitting on a feature reduces impurity on average (or by permuting features and seeing impact on error). While not as interpretable as a single small tree, they are more interpretable than say neural nets, and often you can glean which features matter.

Memory and speed: Training is parallelizable (each tree independent), and can be done in parallel. Predictions with many trees is slower than one tree but can still be relatively fast if trees are not huge (and they can be pruned or limited in depth if needed).

In classification, Random Forest tends to produce well-calibrated probabilities too (the vote fraction from many trees approximates probability). It tends to resist overfitting well due to averaging.

**6.10 Boosting and Gradient Boosting Trees:** **Boosting** is another ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, each trying to fix errors of the previous . The classic boosting algorithm is AdaBoost for classification: start with equal weights on data, train a weak learner (e.g., a shallow tree) to get predictions; increase weights of misclassified points and decrease weights of correctly classified; train next learner on this re-weighted data; continue for many rounds; final prediction is weighted vote of weak learners. AdaBoost tends to focus on hard cases and can often achieve low training error even with weak learners (like depth-1 trees, decision stumps). It has a statistical interpretation as minimizing an exponential loss.

**Gradient Boosting** generalizes boosting by viewing it as an optimization problem in function space . We want to fit $F(x)$ that minimizes some differentiable loss $L(y, F(x))$ (like squared error for regression, logistic loss for classification) . Gradient boosting proceeds in stages: at each stage, compute the gradient of loss with respect to current predictions $F_{m-1}(x)$ for each training point – these gradients indicate how we need to change predictions to reduce loss. Fit a weak learner (often a tree) to predict these residuals (the negative gradients) . Then update $F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \nu \cdot \text{(new tree’s prediction)}$ with some step size $\nu$ (learning rate). Essentially, each tree is trying to correct the remaining errors of the ensemble by fitting to the residuals . This yields a very flexible model – in the limit, if trees are large enough, it can fit data perfectly (so one must regularize: by limiting tree depth, using shrinkage (small $\nu$), possibly subsampling the data at each iteration (which yields **stochastic gradient boosting**)). **XGBoost** and similar implementations add many regularizations (L1/L2 on leaf values, column subsampling, etc.) and are optimized for speed.

Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) have achieved state-of-the-art results in many tabular data competitions (Kaggle etc.). They can handle mixtures of continuous and categorical features (with appropriate encoding or splitting strategies), and are often more accurate than random forests because boosting reduces bias as well as variance (whereas RF mainly reduces variance by averaging many fully grown trees). However, boosting is more prone to overfitting if not tuned properly – too many rounds or too complex learners can overfit. Using a small learning rate $\nu$ (like 0.1, 0.01) plus many trees (hundreds to thousands) tends to generalize well, reminiscent of optimization with small steps.

Boosting has hyperparameters: number of trees $M$, learning rate $\nu$, tree depth (often shallow, e.g., depth 3-8, to keep learners weak and bias high so boosting can reduce bias gradually), and regularization parameters. These are often tuned via cross-validation. One advantage: often a reasonably small ensemble can do very well (compared to random forest which might need hundreds of trees to converge).

**Advanced architectures**: With boosting one can also do boosting on other base learners, not just trees (basis functions, etc.), but trees are favored for their ability to capture interactions easily.

**Summary**: Bagging and Random Forest excel in reducing variance and are easy to parallelize; Boosting excels in reducing bias by sequentially improving the model, often achieving higher accuracy at the cost of being more serial and sensitive to tuning. Many modern libraries implement these (scikit-learn’s RandomForest, GradientBoosting; XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost for boosting with improvements like handling categorical features natively, etc.).

**Practice Problem 6:** You are given a dataset with 100 features and 10,000 examples to predict a binary outcome. Describe how you would approach this with (a) a logistic regression with L1 regularization, (b) a random forest, and (c) a gradient boosted tree model. What steps would you take to tune each (e.g., how to set regularization strength, depth of trees, number of trees)? How would you evaluate and compare their performance fairly? If the logistic regression selected only 5 features as non-zero, how might that insight be useful even if the boosted tree had a slightly better prediction accuracy?

## **7. Deep Learning and Advanced Models**

**7.1 Neural Network Fundamentals and Backpropagation:** A **neural network** is a function approximator inspired by biological neurons, composed of layers of linear transformations and non-linear activation functions. The simplest building block is an artificial neuron: given inputs $x_1,…,x_d$, it computes $z = w_1 x_1 + \cdots + w_d x_d + b$, then an output $a = \sigma(z)$ where $\sigma$ is an activation (like sigmoid or ReLU). A **multi-layer perceptron (MLP)** stacks such neurons in layers: each layer’s outputs feed into next layer’s inputs. For example, a 3-layer network might be: input $\to$ [dense layer 1: $\mathbf{a}^{(1)} = \sigma(W^{(1)} x + b^{(1)})$] $\to$ [dense layer 2: $\mathbf{a}^{(2)} = \sigma(W^{(2)} \mathbf{a}^{(1)} + b^{(2)})$] $\to$ [output layer: $\mathbf{y} = W^{(3)} \mathbf{a}^{(2)} + b^{(3)}$ (for regression or with softmax activation for classification)]. The **parameters** are all the weights and biases $W, b$ in each layer, often millions in modern deep networks.

The key algorithm for training is **Backpropagation** (backward propagation of errors) , which is basically a recursive application of the chain rule to compute gradients of the loss w.rt. each parameter. Specifically, one does a **forward pass**: compute outputs layer by layer up to loss $L$. Then a **backward pass**: compute $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W^{(L)}}$, $\frac{\partial L}{\partial b^{(L)}}$ for last layer, then propagate the gradient through non-linearities back to earlier layers successively . Backprop gives gradients in time proportional to network size (same order as forward pass), which is efficient. With those gradients, one uses an optimizer (like stochastic gradient descent or variants Adam, RMSprop, etc.) to update parameters in direction of negative gradient, thereby minimizing loss.

Mathematically, if layer $k$ has activations $a^{(k)} = \sigma(z^{(k)})$ with $z^{(k)} = W^{(k)} a^{(k-1)} + b^{(k)}$, backprop: compute $\delta^{(k)} = \partial L/\partial z^{(k)}$ (the “error” propagated to layer k). We have $\delta^{(L)}$ at output from loss derivative (e.g. $\delta^{(L)} = (y_{pred}-y_{true})$ for MSE or more complicated for cross-entropy combined with softmax gives $\delta = \hat{y}-y$). Then propagate: $\delta^{(k)} = ((W^{(k+1)})^T \delta^{(k+1)}) \odot \sigma’(z^{(k)})$. Then gradients: $\partial L/\partial W^{(k)} = \delta^{(k)} (a^{(k-1)})^T$ and $\partial L/\partial b^{(k)} = \delta^{(k)}$ (summed over training cases if doing batch). This is the core of backprop .

Neural networks can approximate extremely complex functions given enough hidden units (Universal Approximation Theorem: a single hidden layer with enough neurons can approximate any continuous function on compact input domain). But training is tricky: the optimization is non-convex, can have many local minima or saddle points, and is sensitive to initialization and learning rate. Techniques like proper weight initialization, activation function choices (ReLU helped a lot vs sigmoid which can saturate ), batch normalization, dropout (regularization), and sophisticated optimizers have made training deep nets feasible.

**7.2 Activation Functions (Sigmoid, ReLU, etc.):** Activation functions introduce non-linearity; without them, a stack of linear layers would collapse to one linear layer. Common activations:

- **Sigmoid $\sigma(x) = 1/(1+e^{-x})$:** outputs in (0,1), historically used in early networks and for binary classification output (for hidden layers it’s less used now because of vanishing gradient issues when saturated at 0 or 1 – gradients $\sigma’(x) = \sigma(x)(1-\sigma(x))$ become very small for large |x|, hampering learning in deep nets). Good for output probabilities though .
    
- **Tanh $(\tanh(x))$:** outputs in (-1,1), zero-centered which can be nicer than sigmoid for some architectures. It’s basically a scaled sigmoid ($\tanh(x) = 2\sigma(2x)-1$). Still saturates for large |x|.
    
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: $\text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0,x)$ . It’s now the default for hidden layers in many deep nets. It’s piecewise linear: passes positive inputs through, zeros out negatives. It is non-linear at 0 (so not a simple linear function overall, yet mathematically simpler and avoids saturation for positive inputs) . Benefits: gradient doesn’t vanish for $x>0$ (gradient=1 there), it promotes sparse activations (many neurons output 0, which can help avoid too diffuse representations), and is cheap to compute. Downside: neurons can “die” if they get into a regime where they output 0 for all training inputs (gradients 0, thus they never update – mitigated by good initialization or use of leaky ReLU).
    
- **Leaky ReLU:** same as ReLU but a small slope in negative region (e.g. 0.01 * x for x<0) to avoid dead neurons. There’s also **Parametric ReLU** where that slope is learned.
    
- **Softmax:** used in output layer for multi-class classification. Softmax$(z)_i = e^{z_i}/\sum_j e^{z_j}$ – gives a probability distribution over classes. It’s often combined with cross-entropy loss for training (which yields nice gradients).
    
- **Others:** **Softplus** (smooth ReLU: $\log(1+e^x)$), **ELU**, **Swish** (recently $x \sigma(x)$ by Google), etc. In practice, ReLU (or slight variants) dominate hidden layers usage in CNNs and dense nets, while tanh still sees use in RNN gates along with sigmoids.
    

Choice of activation can affect training speed and performance. Historically, networks with sigmoid/tanh had troubles with deep layers (vanishing/exploding gradients). ReLU significantly helped training of deep networks around 2010 . It’s not that ReLU is perfect: it’s not differentiable at 0, but in practice backprop can just pick a subgradient or treat gradient as 0 at 0. That hasn’t been an issue. The simplicity and ability to propagate gradients far (since gradient is 1 in positive region) enabled very deep networks.

**7.3 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** CNNs are tailored for data with spatial structure (like images, though also used for time series). A **Convolutional layer** performs convolution operation: it has a set of learnable filters (kernels) that are small (e.g., $3\times3$ or $5\times5$ for images), and it slides these filters over the input producing feature maps . Each filter detects a certain local pattern (like an edge, texture etc. in images). Key ideas: **local receptive fields** (neurons connect only to a local region of input, not the entire input – exploiting spatial locality) , **shared weights** (the same filter is applied across different positions – equivariance to translation) , and often **downsampling**(pooling) to reduce resolution and achieve some invariance .

A typical CNN architecture for image classification: Input image (e.g. 32x32x3 color channels) $\to$ conv layer (say 16 filters $5\times5$, stride 1) $\to$ ReLU $\to$ maybe pooling (2x2 max pooling) $\to$ conv (32 filters $5\times5$) $\to$ ReLU $\to$ pool $\to$ … eventually flatten to fully connected layers for classification. Convolution preserves spatial layout while pooling reduces it. Early layers learn low-level features (edges), deeper layers combine to higher-level (object parts) – essentially learning a hierarchy of features (like classic vision pipeline but learned end-to-end). This architecture leverages that **features at nearby pixels matter more** than far apart for e.g. edges, and that patterns can occur anywhere in image (hence weight sharing: same filter sliding over entire image picks up that pattern regardless of position) . CNNs achieved huge improvement in tasks like image classification (e.g. AlexNet 2012 success) and remain core in vision tasks (though now often combined with other modules).

Mathematically, a conv layer computing one feature map: $(f * X)(i,j) = \sum_{u=1}^{k}\sum_{v=1}^{k} W_{u,v} X_{i+u-1, j+v-1} + b$. That is, sum elementwise product of kxk kernel and the image patch. Multiple filters yield multiple output maps. Non-linearity (ReLU) then applied, often followed by **Pooling** (like max or average pooling) to aggregate responses over a region (pooling gives translational invariance within small region and downsamples to reduce computations and allow hierarchical combination). Some modern architectures replace some pooling with strided convolutions or use global average pooling at end.

**Training CNNs:** uses backprop like any network, but special in that many weights are shared – gradient accumulates from all positions the filter was applied . The spatial arrangement introduces hyperparams like filter size, stride (step size of sliding), and number of filters per layer.

Due to weight sharing, CNNs have far fewer parameters than an equivalent fully connected network handling images, making them easier to train and less prone to overfit, plus they encode prior knowledge of locality and translation invariance, which helps performance. They dominated image tasks until perhaps the recent advent of Vision Transformers (which use global self-attention).

CNNs also apply in 1D (signal processing, text as 1D sequence – text CNNs for certain NLP tasks), and 3D (volumetric data, video as 3D with time as third dimension), etc.

**7.4 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs:** RNNs are designed for sequential data (time series, language) where order matters and potentially sequences of variable length. An **RNN** has hidden state $h_t$ that gets updated as it reads sequence elements. A simple RNN update: $h_t = f(W_{xh} x_t + W_{hh} h_{t-1} + b)$, and output maybe $y_t = W_{hy} h_t$ . Here $W_{hh}$ is a recurrent weight matrix capturing influence of previous hidden state (thus previous inputs) on current. Essentially, it’s like applying the same neural network cell at each time step, taking input $x_t$ and previous state $h_{t-1}$, outputting new state (and perhaps an output). Because $W_{hh}$ is shared across time, an RNN can, in principle, retain memory of arbitrarily long contexts (though practically limited by vanishing/exploding gradients in basic RNNs).

Training RNNs uses backprop through time (BPTT): unroll the RNN for T steps (like a deep network of depth T with shared weights at each layer), compute loss (maybe sum of per-step losses), then backpropagate gradients through the unrolled network, then sum gradients for shared weights. Vanilla RNNs suffer from **vanishing gradients** for long sequences – as one backprops many steps, gradients can shrink exponentially (or explode if weights >1 in spectral radius) . This made learning long-range dependencies hard.

Enter **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber 1997) and **GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units)** mid-2010s, which are RNN variants with gating mechanisms to better control information flow and mitigate vanishing gradient . An LSTM cell has an explicit memory cell $c_t$ and gates: _input gate_ (how much new input to write to cell), _forget gate_ (how much of cell’s old content to keep), _output gate_ (how much of cell to expose as $h_t$) . Formulas:

f_t = \sigma(W_f [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) \text{ (forget gate)},

i_t = \sigma(W_i [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) \text{ (input gate)},

o_t = \sigma(W_o [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) \text{ (output gate)},

\tilde{c}t = \tanh(W_c [h{t-1}, x_t] + b_c) \text{ (cell candidate)},

c_t = f_t \odot c_{t-1} + i_t \odot \tilde{c}t,

h_t = o_t \odot \tanh(c_t).

_These gates enable the network to maintain long-term info in $c_t$ by letting $f_t \approx 1$ and $i_t \approx 0$ so $c_t$ is mostly previous $c_{t-1}$ (carry memory forward), or to flush it ($f_t$ small), or write new content ($i_t$ large). LSTMs effectively ameliorate vanishing gradients by providing more linear path for gradient flow (through $c_t$ memory with partial derivatives possibly staying near 1 if $f_t$ near 1) . They achieve impressive sequence memory and were state-of-the-art for sequence tasks (language modeling, translation) before attention mechanisms took over.

**GRUs** are a simplified LSTM (combine forget & input gate into one “update gate”, fewer parameters). They often perform similarly with a bit less computation.

RNNs can be used for many tasks: in language, an RNN can encode a sentence into a context vector (last $h_T$), or output a sequence (like translation, using an encoder RNN for source, and a decoder RNN to generate target language word by word, feeding previous output as next input – this was seq2seq with attention, replaced now by transformers). They can also do time series prediction, music generation, etc. They are Turing-complete in theory and can model very complex patterns.

Training RNNs is computationally heavier per data point (due to sequential processing, less parallelization than CNNs). There were tricks like truncated BPTT (limit backprop steps to manageable length) to reduce cost, at risk of losing long dependencies.

**7.5 Attention Mechanisms and Transformers:** **Attention** was introduced to let models dynamically focus on relevant parts of input sequence when generating output . Instead of fixed-size context vector in seq2seq, **attention mechanism**computes a weight for each source position based on how relevant it is to the current decoding step (like a learned alignment). The decoder then sees a weighted sum of encoder hidden states (context vector) that focus on relevant words . This improved translation quality by allowing model to look at source positions adaptively for each target word.

**Self-attention** goes further: in a sequence, each element attends to all other elements (the idea behind Transformer architecture) . A self-attention layer transforms a sequence of vectors $(x_1,…,x_n)$ to $(z_1,…,z_n)$ where each $z_i$ is a weighted sum of linearly transformed $x_j$‘s, with weights determined by compatibility of $x_i$ and $x_j$ via dot product (or a learned metric). Specifically, **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: for each position $i$, compute scores $s_{ij} = (Q x_i) \cdot (K x_j) / \sqrt{d}$ (where $Q,K$ are learned matrices, $\sqrt{d}$ for scaling), take softmax over j to get weights $a_{ij}$, then $z_i = \sum_j a_{ij} (V x_j)$ . Here $Q,K,V$ are the query, key, value projection matrices. Intuitively, each position queries the sequence for relevant information via key vectors, and values are aggregated. The result is that each output element $z_i$ can attend to any positions j (with how much weight determined by similarity of queries and keys), thus capturing long-range dependencies efficiently . It’s effectively O(n^2) to compute for sequence length n, but for moderate n (like n=512 words) it’s fine on GPUs.

The **Transformer** (Vaswani et al. 2017 “Attention is All You Need”) uses multi-head self-attention (multiple sets of $Q,K,V$ to capture info from different representation subspaces) followed by position-wise feedforward networks, plus positional encodings to give sense of order (since self-attention is permutation invariant without adding position info) . It forgoes recurrence entirely and relies on attention mechanism to propagate information globally. Transformers allow parallel processing of sequences (since you can compute attention for all positions in parallel, unlike RNN which is sequential). This led to much faster training and ability to train on very large corpora, enabling models like BERT and GPT.

**Transformers** have become the dominant architecture in NLP and are making inroads in vision (Vision Transformers), audio, etc. They scale well with data and computation. Key components: multi-head self-attention, feed-forward, residual connections (so gradients flow better), layer normalization. They typically require large memory for the O(n^2) attention, but recent research works on sparse or linear attention to handle longer sequences.

**7.6 Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** GNNs extend neural networks to graph-structured data (social networks, molecules, knowledge graphs). A common approach is **Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN)** where each node iteratively aggregates messages from neighbors to update its representation. One formulation: $h_v^{(k)} = \text{Aggregate}_{u \in N(v)}( W \cdot h_u^{(k-1)} )$ for some learned weight matrix $W$ and maybe including $h_v^{(k-1)}$ itself (and possibly edge features). After $K$ rounds, $h_v^{(K)}$ is the node’s embedding capturing up to $K$-hop neighborhood information. This is used for node classification, link prediction, or graph classification (where one might pool node embeddings or use a special global node).

Popular types: **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** (Kipf & Welling 2017) which essentially does $H^{(k)} = \sigma( \tilde{D}^{-1/2}\tilde{A}\tilde{D}^{-1/2} H^{(k-1)} W^{(k)} )$ where $\tilde{A}=A+I$ (with self loops), $\tilde{D}$ is degree matrix. It’s like a convolution on graph using normalized adjacency to mix neighbor features . **GraphSAGE** uses concatenation of own and neighbor mean. **GAT (Graph Attention Network)** uses attention to weight neighbors (learn weight for each neighbor rather than uniform or degree-based).

GNNs have shown success in social recommendation, protein interface predictions, chemical property predictions (treat molecule as graph of atoms), etc. They respect graph topology – permutation invariant/equivariant in appropriate ways (output maybe invariant to node relabeling, or in node classification output arrangement equivariant to input labeling). They often are limited by message passing radius – many use 2-3 hops due to computational or over-smoothing issues (where node representations of all nodes start to converge if too many hops, losing distinction). Over-smoothing is mitigated by residual connections or normalization.

**7.7 BERT and Pre-trained Language Models:** **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** is a landmark model (Devlin et al. 2018) . It is essentially a deep Transformer encoder trained on large corpus (like Wikipedia + books) in a self-supervised way: using tasks like **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**(predicting masked words in a sentence, requiring bidirectional context) and **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)** (predict if one sentence follows another) . BERT’s architecture: up to 12 or 24 layers of transformer encoder, with hidden size 768 or 1024 (base vs large), multi-head attention (12 or 16 heads), learned positional embeddings, etc. After pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned on a target NLP task with relatively small data, yielding state-of-the-art results because the model already learned a lot of language knowledge (grammar, facts, semantic relationships) during pre-training . It’s “bidirectional” in contrast to earlier GPT or others which were unidirectional (predict next word given past, but not future). BERT’s MLM trains the model to use both left and right context.

It’s **pre-trained** – akin to how computer vision uses ImageNet pre-trained CNN for other tasks, NLP now uses BERT (or its successors like RoBERTa, ALBERT, DeBERTa, etc.) to fine-tune on classification, QA, etc. BERT output yields contextual embedding for each token. For classification tasks, typically take the special [CLS] token’s embedding and feed to a classifier; for Q&A, have model output start and end positions.

One can also use BERT as a feature extractor (embedding sentences) but fine-tuning yields better results usually (because it adjusts representation for the task).

Following BERT, a family of large pre-trained models emerged, including **GPT** series for generative tasks (OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer – used decoder-only architecture for autoregressive generation, culminating in GPT-3 with 175B parameters that can few-shot learn tasks), and models like T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) that unify all tasks into a text-to-text format, etc.

These models are extremely large, trained on massive data, capturing surprisingly broad knowledge, effectively acting somewhat like knowledge bases. They raise interesting evaluation aspects: they often know facts (BERT was found to know capital cities, etc.), but also may hallucinate (especially generation models like GPT-3 can produce plausible but incorrect info).

**7.8 Learning Counterfactuals with Neural Nets (Causal ML):** There’s growing work at intersection of deep learning and causal inference. One theme: using representation learning to handle confounding. E.g., **counterfactual regression networks** (Shalit et al. 2017) learn a representation $\Phi(x)$ of covariates such that treated and control distributions look similar in that space (balancing), while also predicting outcomes well . They added a term to loss for distribution distance between $\Phi(x)$ distributions of treated vs control (like integral probability metric or MMD) to force balanced representations . The network has two heads (one predicting outcome if treated, one if control). This aims to reduce selection bias and predict individual treatment effects $Y(1)-Y(0)$. They found such representations improved causal inference from observational data.

Another angle: **Counterfactual explanation** – how to minimally tweak input to change model’s decision (like interpretability – “what would have to change for this loan to be approved?”). Methods use neural nets to generate counterfactual examples near the original input that flip the output while remaining plausible . They often optimize an objective mixing model prediction change and closeness to original input.

**Causal Discovery**: use neural nets to learn causal graph structure from observational data (often with differentiable score and enforcing acyclicity constraint – e.g., NOTEARS method uses a neural net approach to discover DAG structure).

**Reinforcement Learning** intersects with causality when considering learning policies and evaluating counterfactual outcomes (off-policy evaluation etc.), where deep RL might embed models that must infer effects of actions (like bandit feedback and counterfactual regret minimization net training in games like AlphaGo uses self-play to simulate counterfactual outcomes).

**Counterfactual Fairness**: using neural nets to adjust decisions such that protected attributes (like race) have no causal effect on outcome (ensuring fairness by training a predictor that is independent of protected attribute in a causal sense, requiring certain adversarial or disentangled rep learning).

In summary, neural networks in causal tasks either try to learn balanced representations for treatment effect estimation , or generate counterfactual data or explanations by leveraging generative models, or embed differentiable causal reasoning modules. It’s a cutting-edge area bridging black-box modeling with the need for causal interpretability and true generalization (beyond correlations).

**Practice Problem 7:** Consider an online advertising scenario. We want to know the causal effect of showing an ad (treatment) on whether a user purchases (outcome). We have many user features. We suspect that showing ads is more likely to users who have certain features that also predispose them to purchase (confounding). How might we use a neural network to adjust for confounders and estimate the treatment effect? (Hint: think about representation learning as in counterfactual regression, or training a neural net with a loss function that encourages balance between treated and control feature distributions). Additionally, if we have a trained model that predicts purchase probability, how could we generate a “counterfactual explanation” for a user who didn’t purchase (e.g., what minimal change in user features would likely have led to a purchase, according to the model)?

## **8. Applications and Case Studies**

**8.1 Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTMs):** Time series forecasting aims to predict future values based on past observations. Traditional statistical models include **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: AR(p) means regression on $p$ past values, MA(q) means moving average on past $q$ errors, and I(d) indicates differencing the series $d$ times to make it stationary. ARIMA models are specified by $(p,d,q)$. For example, ARIMA(1,1,1): $\nabla y_t = \phi_1 \nabla y_{t-1} + \theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$ where $\nabla$ is difference and $\varepsilon$ is white noise. Analysts examine autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) plots to choose p and q, ensure stationarity, etc. ARIMA fits well for linear dynamics, seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) adds seasonal terms. But ARIMA struggles with multiple seasonalities or complex patterns.

**Facebook Prophet** (now just “Prophet”) is a newer tool that fits time series with an additive model: $y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \varepsilon_t$ , where $g(t)$ is piecewise linear or logistic trend, $s(t)$ is periodic seasonal effects (they use Fourier series), $h(t)$ accounts for holidays by allowing specified events with extra adjustments . Prophet uses a regression with priors to fit these components, which makes it easy to capture common patterns (like a yearly seasonality, weekly seasonality, holiday spikes). It’s **automated forecasting** – user can supply historical data and it will fit and extrapolate the trend and seasonal terms. Prophet requires specifying typical seasonal periods (e.g., yearly, weekly) and any known change points or it will automatically detect change points in trend. It’s robust and user-friendly, trading some flexibility for interpretability (trend + season decomposition) . It’s not as good if series has complex autoregressive patterns beyond those components, but often business time series have trend+seasonality dominating.

**LSTMs for time series**: On long complicated sequences, or when there’s lots of external factors, RNNs or LSTMs can be used to forecast. For example, given a window of past values or even a sequence of exogenous inputs, an LSTM can learn to output next value or next sequence. LSTMs can capture non-linear relationships and long-term dependencies (like an effect that repeats after many lags, which AR might need many terms for). With enough data, an LSTM can outperform ARIMA for complex patterns, but it’s also more data-hungry and less interpretable (can’t easily say “seasonality = this much” though one could attempt to extract that).

**Ensemble/hybrid** approaches exist too (e.g., use ARIMA for linear part and an ANN for non-linear residuals). In Kaggle, often gradient boosting or deep nets with engineered features (like lag values, rolling stats) have done well for forecasting competitions.

**8.2 Tabular Data Regression & Classification:** Many practical tasks have data in tables: features could be numeric or categorical, not necessarily images/text. For classification (predicting discrete labels) or regression (continuous target), we often use methods like decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting (which excel on tabular data), or neural networks (less dominant on small tabular data but can work, especially with a lot of data or when using embeddings for categorical features). The challenge in tabular data is often feature engineering: creating meaningful features or encoding categorical variables properly (one-hot, target encoding, etc.). Ensemble methods reduce need for heavy manual feature interactions because trees handle interactions by splitting sequentially, and boosting does a form of feature combination implicitly.

For example, predicting house prices (regression) with features like size, location, number of rooms, etc.: one might try linear regression (with interactions like location*size if needed) or a random forest (which can naturally capture that maybe location affects price non-linearly). The **evaluation metrics** differ: regression uses RMSE or MAE; classification uses accuracy, precision/recall, AUC, etc.

One must watch for **overfitting** (especially if many features relative to data points). Techniques: cross-validate to tune complexity, or apply regularization (L1/L2 for linear, depth limit for trees, dropout or smaller network for NN). Also, data preprocessing like scaling numeric features (important for e.g. NN or k-NN, not needed for trees), and imputation for missing values, encoding categories.

**8.3 Model Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, AUC, Precision/Recall):** Choosing the right metric is crucial. **Accuracy** = $\frac{\text{# correct}}{\text{# total}}$ is simplest for classification, but can be misleading if classes are imbalanced. E.g., 99% negatives, a trivial model that predicts all negative has 99% accuracy but is worthless. So for imbalanced data, focus on **precision** (positive predictive value: $TP/(TP+FP)$) and **recall** (sensitivity: $TP/(TP+FN)$) . **F1-score**is harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing them. If missing one positive is very bad (like missing a disease case), recall is prioritized; if false alarms are costly, precision is key. **ROC AUC (Area Under ROC Curve)** measures discrimination: how well the model ranks positive vs negative. ROC plots TPR vs FPR at various thresholds; AUC is probability that a random positive is ranked above a random negative. AUC is threshold-independent (which is a strength and a weakness; if a specific threshold performance matters, PR curve or specific metrics might be more informative). For heavily imbalanced and when positives are rare, **Precision-Recall curves** and **Average Precision (AP)** can be more insightful. A classifier with AUC ~ 0.5 is random, ~1 is perfect; AP similarly 0 to 1.

**Calibration**: metrics like **Brier score** or explicit calibration curves measure if predicted probabilities reflect true probabilities (e.g., among all items model gives 0.8 probability, ~80% should be positive) . Random forests and boosted trees are fairly good on calibration (especially if many trees); Platt scaling or isotonic regression can calibrate an SVM or boosting if needed.

For regression: **MSE/RMSE** emphasises large errors (since squaring), **MAE** (mean absolute error) more robust to outliers (L1 norm), **$R^2$** (coefficient of determination) indicates percent variance explained, though in non-linear models $R^2$ can still be used as goodness-of-fit measure comparing to baseline mean model.

**8.4 Calibration and Reliability of Predictions:** We touched on calibration: e.g., in a medical risk model, if it says “10% risk”, we want about 10 out of 100 with that score to have the event. **Calibration curve** plots predicted probability vs actual frequency : ideally a diagonal line . Some models (like naive Bayes or boosted trees with few rounds) can output overconfident or underconfident probabilities. **Isotonic regression calibration** or **Platt scaling**(logistic reg on model log-odds) can adjust them using a validation set. **Reliability diagrams** are another name for calibration plots. For critical applications, being well-calibrated can be as important as high AUC: e.g., if you’re deploying a model to guide decisions, you want the probability to mean what it says.

**Decision curve analysis** is another technique: see net benefit at different threshold choices to assist threshold selection for classification (particularly in medical decision making).

**8.5 Overfitting, Cross-Validation, and Model Selection:** Overfitting arises when model learns noise or peculiarities of training data that do not generalize. It often shows as much better performance on train than test. Strategies to avoid: use simpler model (regularization, fewer features, smaller network, fewer trees, pruning, etc.), or gather more data, or data augmentation (especially in images, e.g., random flips, crops to effectively increase training set).

**Cross-validation** is a key tool: e.g., k-fold CV (split data into k sets, train on k-1 parts, validate on the held-out part, repeat so each part is once validation; average performance). It helps estimate generalization performance more reliably than a single train-test split, especially if dataset is not large. CV is used to choose hyperparameters: we search over grid or random values for, say, the depth of a tree or L2 penalty, using CV to evaluate each setting, then pick best and retrain on full training data with that. One must be careful to not leak test data into parameter tuning (so final test is only done once with chosen model to report performance). For time series, instead of random CV, we do a rolling origin or forward chaining (train on first part, test on next slice, etc., to respect time order).

**Ensemble selection**: sometimes combining models (averaging or stacking) yields better result than single best model. Kaggle winners often ensemble dozens of models to squeeze out extra performance (averaging helps reduce variance). But in deployment, ensemble complexity vs marginal gain must be weighed.

Finally, communicate results with not just metrics but also understanding of errors: confusion matrix (for classification) gives granular view, maybe inspect some mispredictions to see if there’s systematic issues (like model always confuses two particular classes or fails on a certain subgroup – which might point to collecting more data or adjusting features).

**Practice Problem 8:** You built a spam email classifier. On a test set of 1000 emails (100 spam, 900 not spam), your model predicts spam for 120 emails, of which 80 are actually spam and 40 are not. Compute precision, recall, and F1 for spam class. The model outputs a probability for each email; you notice many legitimate emails get scores around 0.4–0.5, and many spam emails get around 0.6–0.7, meaning there’s overlap. How might you improve the model’s precision without hurting recall too much? (Hint: adjusting threshold vs improving model). If the model’s predicted probabilities are not well-calibrated (say it outputs 0.9 for a lot of emails that are only 50% spam), how could you calibrate it? Finally, to ensure your model isn’t overfitting, how would you use cross-validation during development?

## **9. Visualizations, Tools, and Practical Tips**

**9.1 Data Visualization with Python (Plotly Example):** Visualization is key to understanding data and model behavior. Python offers many libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn for static, **Plotly** for interactive graphs, etc.). Plotly can create interactive charts like time series plots, 3D scatter, or even model decision boundary plots. For instance, to visualize a learned function, we could grid over input space and show predicted value as heatmap or contours. Or to illustrate CLT (as we did with matplotlib earlier but could with Plotly too).

Here’s an illustrative example of using Plotly to visualize the learning curve (train vs validation error over epochs in an NN):

```
import plotly.graph_objects as go

epochs = list(range(1, len(train_loss)+1))
fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=epochs, y=train_loss, mode='lines+markers', name='Train Loss'))
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=epochs, y=val_loss, mode='lines+markers', name='Validation Loss'))
fig.update_layout(title="Learning Curve", xaxis_title="Epoch", yaxis_title="Loss")
fig.show()
```

This would produce an interactive line chart. Visualizing learning curves can indicate overfitting (if validation loss starts rising while train continues falling). Similarly, we might visualize feature relationships: e.g., scatter plot of two features colored by class to see if model separation is plausible. For high-dim data, using techniques like t-SNE or PCA to reduce to 2D and plot can reveal clusters.

Plotly can also do **embedding visualizations**: you can embed images in the output (like we did for CLT demonstration). It is convenient in Jupyter notebooks or interactive dashboards.

**9.2 Example: Visualizing the Central Limit Theorem:** We already generated a figure using matplotlib showing histogram of sample means vs normal curve. We could do similar with Plotly to allow interactive exploration: e.g., slider for sample size to see distribution change as n increases.

Using code, one could simulate for various n, and update histogram accordingly. Or show side by side histograms for original distribution and distribution of mean (as we did). Interactivity might let user choose underlying distribution shape (e.g., exponential vs uniform) to see that CLT works for both.

**9.3 LaTeX/TikZ for Model Diagrams (Example Code):** TikZ is a LaTeX package for drawing high-quality diagrams, often used for neural network diagrams in research papers. For example, a small feed-forward network can be illustrated:

```
\begin{tikzpicture}[x=1.2cm, y=0.8cm]
% Draw nodes
\node[circle, draw, fill=blue!20] (x1) at (0,1) {$x_1$};
\node[circle, draw, fill=blue!20] (x2) at (0,-1) {$x_2$};
\node[rectangle, draw, fill=green!20] (h1) at (2,0) {$h_1$};
\node[rectangle, draw, fill=green!20] (h2) at (2,-2) {$h_2$};
\node[circle, draw, fill=red!20] (y) at (4,-1) {$\hat{y}$};
% Connect nodes
\draw[->] (x1) -- (h1);
\draw[->] (x1) -- (h2);
\draw[->] (x2) -- (h1);
\draw[->] (x2) -- (h2);
\draw[->] (h1) -- (y);
\draw[->] (h2) -- (y);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

This code draws two input neurons (circles), two hidden neurons (rectangles), and one output neuron, connecting inputs to hidden, hidden to output with arrows. With LaTeX compile, it yields a neat diagram. This helps communicate network architecture in documentation or publication. In our primer context, such a diagram can clarify the structure of a simple network.

TikZ can also illustrate other concepts: e.g., a Markov chain diagram, a Bayes net graph, or a support vector margin with points and a hyperplane.

**9.4 Mermaid for Workflow Diagrams (Example Code):** Mermaid is a markdown-like syntax to generate diagrams (flowcharts, sequence diagrams) that some Markdown editors and docs support (like in GitHub or knowledge wikis). For instance, to illustrate a machine learning pipeline, we could write:

````
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Raw Data] --> B[Data Preprocessing];
    B --> C[Train Model];
    C --> D[Evaluate on Test];
    D --> E{Performance OK?};
    E -- Yes --> F[Deploy Model];
    E -- No --> B;
````

````
This describes a flowchart: Raw Data -> Preprocessing -> Train -> Evaluate -> decision -> if yes, deploy, if no, loop back to preprocessing (maybe to get more data or adjust features). This high-level visual is great for explaining process to stakeholders. Mermaid is nice because it's text, version-controllable, and can be embedded in certain docs.

Another use: to depict a decision tree in text form:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Start]) --> Q1{Feature X > 5?};
    Q1 -->|Yes| Leaf1[Predict Y=1];
    Q1 -->|No| Q2{Feature Z < 0?};
    Q2 -->|Yes| Leaf2[Predict Y=0];
    Q2 -->|No| Leaf3[Predict Y=1];
````

This draws a simple tree. Not as clear as a drawn one but in text environment or documentation it’s useful.

**General Tips:** Always visualize your data before modeling (distributions, scatter plots) – it may reveal outliers or the need for transformations. When modeling, plot training history (especially for deep learning) to catch overfitting early. Visualize model results: confusion matrix heatmap to see where errors concentrate, or calibration plots to verify probabilities, or partial dependence plots for feature effect in complex models like boosting (though with caution, as these average out other feature influences).

**9.5 Practical Model Deployment:** Not asked in the primer explicitly, but worth noting: beyond modeling, deploying models to production requires considerations: model serialization (pickle, ONNX for interoperability, etc.), setting up an API or embedding into an application, monitoring model performance and data drift (so if incoming data distribution shifts, performance might degrade), scheduling retraining if needed, and logging predictions for analysis. Tools like TensorFlow Serving or PyTorch’s TorchServe or even simple Flask apps can serve models. Ensuring reproducibility (fix random seeds, record library versions) and testing on fresh data are important steps.

**Conclusion:** This comprehensive primer spanned from fundamental statistical theory (expectations, distributions, CLT), through inference and hypothesis testing, to machine learning algorithms and modern deep learning. We saw unifying threads – e.g., law of large numbers justifies Monte Carlo; bias-variance trade-off appears in linear models and in complex ones, regularization as a theme to manage complexity; and how new techniques (like attention) build on earlier ones (like sequence models). The field is vast, but a solid grounding in statistics (probability, distributions, inference) is crucial to correctly apply machine learning, and understanding machine learning methods mathematically (loss functions, optimization, generalization theory) helps to innovate and troubleshoot in practice. By studying both the rigorous theory and practical techniques, graduate students can develop the _deep conceptual mastery_ and _mathematical intuition_ needed to push the state of the art – or simply to apply these methods wisely in their own research and industry projects.
