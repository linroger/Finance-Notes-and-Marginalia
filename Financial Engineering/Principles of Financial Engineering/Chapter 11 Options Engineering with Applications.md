# 11.1 INTRODUCTION  

This chapter discusses traditional option strategies from the financial engineering perspective and provides market-based examples. It then moves on to discuss exotic options. We are concerned with portfolios and positions that are taken with a precise gain loss profile in mind. The players consciously take risks in the hope of benefiting or protecting themselves from an expected movement in a certain risk factor. Most investor behavior is of this kind. Investors buy a stock with a higher (systematic) risk, in anticipation of higher returns. A high-yield bond carries a higher default probability, which the bond holder is willing to bear. For all the different instruments, there are one or more risk factors that influence the gains and losses of the position taken. The investor weighs the risks due to potentially adverse movements in these factors against the gains that will result, if these factors behave in the way the investor expected. Some of the hedging activity can be interpreted in a similar way. This chapter deals with techniques and strategies that use options in doing this. We consider classical (vanilla) as well as exotic options tools.  

According to an important theorem in modern finance, if options of all strikes exist, carefully selected option portfolios can replicate any desired gain loss profile that an investor or a hedger desires. We can synthetically create any asset using a (static) portfolio of carefully selected options, since financial positions are taken with a payoff in mind. Hence, we start our discussion by looking at payoff diagrams.  

# 11.1.1 PAYOFF DIAGRAMS  

Let $x_{t}$ be a random variable representing the time- $t$ value of a risk factor, and let $f(x_{T})$ be a function that indicates the payoff of an arbitrary instrument at "maturity" date $T$, given the value of $x_{T}$ at time $T>t.$ We call $f(x_{T})$ a payoff function. The functional form of $f(.)$ is known if the contract is well defined. It is customary in textbooks to represent the pair $\{f(x_{T}),x_{T}\}$ as in Figure 11.1 or 11.2. Note that, here, we have a nonlinear upward sloping payoff function that depends on the values assumed by $x_{T}$ only. The payoff diagram in Figure 11.1 is drawn in a completely arbitrary fashion, yet, it illustrates some of the general principles of financial exposures. Let us review these.

# FIGURE 11.2  

Payoff of a linear exposure.  

First of all, for fairly priced exposures that have zero value of initiation, net exposures to a risk factor, $x_{T}$, must be negative for some values of the underlying risk. Otherwise, we would be making positive gains, and there would be no risk of losing money. This would be an arbitrage opportunity. Swap-type instruments fall into this category. If, on the other hand, the final payoffs of the contract are non-negative for all values of $x_{T}$, the exposure has a positive value at initiation, and to take the position an upfront payment will have to be made. Option positions have this characteristic.

Second, exposures can be convex, concave, or linear with respect to $x_{T}$, and this has relevance for an investor or market professional. The implication of linearity is obvious: the sensitivity of the position to movements in $x_{T}$ is constant. The relevance of convexity was discussed in Chapters 9 and 10. With convexity, movements in volatility need to be priced in, and again options are an important category here.  

Finally, it is preferable that the payoff functions $f(x_{T})$ depend only on the underlying risk, $x_{T}$, and do not move due to extraneous risks. We saw in Chapters 9 and 10 that volatility positions taken with options may not satisfy this requirement. The issue will be discussed in Chapter 15.  

# 11.1.1.1 Examples of $x_t$  

The discussion thus far dealt with an abstract underlying, $x_{t}.$ This underlying can be almost any risk the human mind can think of. The following lists some well-known examples of $x_{t}$:  

Various interest rates: The best examples are LIBOR rates and swap rates. But the commercial paper (CP) rate, the federal funds rate, the index of overnight interest rates (an example of which is EONIA, Euro Over Night Index Average), and many others are also used as reference rates. Exchange rates, especially major exchange rates such as dollar euro, dollar yen, dollar sterling ("cable"), and dollar Swiss franc. Equity indices: Here also the examples are numerous. Besides the well-known US indices such as the Dow, NASDAQ, and the S&P500, there are European indices such as CAC40, DAX, and FTSE100, as well as various Asian indices such as the Nikkei 225 and emerging market indices. Commodities are also quite amenable to such positions. Futures on coffee, soybeans, and energy are other examples for $x_{T}.$ Bond price indices: One example is the EMBI+ prepared by JPMorgan to track emerging market bonds.  

Besides these well-known risks, there are more complicated underlyings that, nevertheless, are central elements in financial market activity:  

[^1]: The underlying to the option positions discussed in this chapter can represent volatility or variance. If we let the percentage volatility of a price, at time $t$, be denoted by $\sigma_{t}$, then the time $T$ value of the underlying $x_{T}$ may be defined as
$$
x_{T}=\int_{t}^{T}\sigma_{u}^{2}S_{u}^{2}\mathrm{d}u
$$  

where $S_{u}$ may be any risk factor. In this case, $x_{T}$ represents the total variance of $S_{u}$ during the interval $[t,T]$. Volatility is the square root of $x_{T}$.  

[^2]: The correlation between two risk factors can be traded in a similar way.

[^3]: The underlying, $x_{t}$, can also represent the default probability associated with a counterparty or instrument. This arises in the case of credit instruments.

[^4]: The underlying can represent the probability of an extraordinary event happening. This would create a "Cat" instrument that can be used to buy insurance against various catastrophic events. 5. The underlying, $x_{t}$, can also be a nonstorable item such as electricity, weather, or bandwidth.

Readers who are interested in the details of such contracts or markets should consult Hull (2014). In this chapter, we limit our attention to the engineering aspects of option contracts.  

# 11.2 OPTION STRATEGIES  

We divide the engineering of option strategies into two broad categories. First, we consider the classical option-related methods. These will cover strategies used by market makers as well as retail investors. They will themselves be divided into two groups, those that can be labeled directional strategies, and those that relate to views on the volatility of some underlying instrument. The second category involves exotic options, which we consider as more efficient and sometimes cheaper alternatives to the classical option strategies. The underlying risks can be any of those mentioned in the previous section.  

# 11.2.1 SYNTHETIC LONG AND SHORT POSITIONS  

In this section, we show how options can be used in creating synthetic long and short positions. First, we will review the notion of long and short positions and highlight the limited gain aspect of short positions.  

Figure 11.3a shows the payoff obtained by a long position. This is the simplest example of a linear exposure. A long position in a cash instrument is one where the decision maker owns the cash instrument (i.e., has paid in full). If the asset is denoted by $S_{t}$, he will gain when the price of $S_{t}$ increases and lose when the price declines. Figure 11.3b shows the payoff diagram for a short position. A short position is opposite to the long position. An investor who is short the asset $S_{t}$ will gain when the price declines and lose when the price increases.4  

There is a fundamental asymmetry between the two positions. In a long position, the downside loss is limited by the price paid for the assetâ€”the most the asset value can decline is to zero. However, the upside gain is unlimited. With short positions, the upside gain is limited by the price at which the asset was shorted. The investor collects this price. But the downside loss is in principle unlimited, since the asset price, $S_{t}$, can increase without any theoretical limit. This means that risk management and pricing of short positions may require a significantly different approach from long positions.5  

![](efb99ff06e8177177ba7b8fc20f0f95f49b7b0b7cf8fe45e8e78b8b0c907b36e.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.3  

Payoffs: long and short positions.

The convention is that in a long position the asset is purchased at time $t_0$ for the price $S_{t_0}$, and then sold at time $T$ with price $S_T$. Since the long position is financed by a loan paying the rate $r$ during the period $T-t_0$, the total profit will be  

$$
\text{Profit} = S_T - S_{t_0}(1+r)^{T-t_0}
$$  

In case of the short position, the situation will be reversed. At time $t_0$, the asset $S_{t_0}$ is sold without owning it. This is done by borrowing the security and then selling it. The security has to be returned to the real owner at time $T$, and this is done by buying it at the price $S_T$.6 The total profit of the short position is  

$$
\text{Profit} = S_{t_0}(1+r)^{T-t_0} - S_T
$$  

since the original sale price is invested at the rate $r$ during the period $\Delta = T - t_0$. Clearly, short positions are somewhat more complicated and may involve additional technicalities that we have not included in the preceding formula.7 Short selling is occasionally more difficult than this simple characterization suggests, because the party from which the instrument is borrowed often retains the right to call back the instrument within short notice.  

Put-call parity indicates that:  

$$
S_T - K = (C_T - P_T)
$$  

where $S_T$ is, say, the spot exchange rate at the expiration time $T$ and where $K$ denotes the strike price of options that will expire at time $T$. This suggests a synthetic for long and short positions. In particular, Figure 11.4 shows the payoff of the portfolio (if $K = 0$):  

$$
\{C_t[^1] - P_t[^1]\}
$$  

which is a portfolio where one is long the European call and short the European put. The figure clearly has the same payoff as the traditional long position shown in Figure 11.3a. After all, as shown in Chapter 9, the put-call parity indicates that: if $K = 0$,  

$$
S_T = (C_T[^1] - P_T[^1])
$$  

This will synthetically replicate the long position. In terms of time-$t$ price,  

$$
S_t = C_t - P_t + K e^{-r(T-t)}
$$  

Thus, the portfolio  

$$
\{C_t^K - P_t^K + K e^{-r(T-t)}\}
$$  

is a synthetic long position in the asset $S_t$ even if the strike $K \neq 0$. These operations are shown in Figure 11.5.  

![](49a87ab1a2c44cc6d88a5c6b2b2a93c3af6b2c3ba1b7c97c936c4a614df3c37f.jpg)

# FIGURE 11.5  

Creating a synthetic long with K â‰  0.

Similarly, we may ask how to synthetically take a short position without really having to borrow the underlying instrument and then sell it. Using options, we can short the underlying by  

$$
\{P_t^K - C_t^K - K e^{-r(T-t)}\}
$$  

i.e., buy a put, sell a call, and short the risk-free bond.  

# 11.2.1.1 An application  

Synthetic short and long positions are strategies frequently used by market professionals.  

## EXAMPLE  

A corporation needs to buy 10 million British pounds to make payments on a U.K.-based project. The deadline is three months, hence the firm needs to have UK pounds in three months. The firm can hedge FX exposure by trading the spot cable. Alternatively, the firm can buy 10 million pounds forward against USD. But this may leave a foreign exchange risk mismatch at the corporate level. Instead, the corporation decides to buy three-month calls on sterling with a strike of 1.50.  

At the same time, it sells puts at the same strike to offset the 4% premium paid on the calls. The net position is zero cost, since the put and call premiums are the same. Yet, the position is equivalent to a long position in sterling. The example shows that the synthetic replication of elementary long and short positions using options may be a preferable trade, if there are mismatch risks or if the practitioner needs the leverage. For example, in the application just discussed, GBP forwards may be a better hedge instrument, given the lower liquidity of options. Options may have larger bid-ask spreads in addition.  

The existence of the strike price $K$ in option contracts provides an additional benefit. The long (short) position will have the same payoff as the standard long (short) position for movements of $S_T$ beyond $K$, but the domain of negative payoffs will be different. In this sense, the strike becomes another parameter that the market professional can adjust to meet the client's needs. This is shown in the next example.  

## EXAMPLE  

A corporation would like to sell USD against JPY. The corporation is expecting funds in dollars and needs to eventually pay yen. The spot rate is 110. The corporation can either (i) wait and sell the dollars in the market once these are received, or (ii) the corporation can sell forward dollars, or (iii) the corporation can buy an at-the-money (ATM) put on USD. ATM puts or calls are those whose strikes equal the current value of the underlying.  

Alternatively, the corporation buys the ATM yen calls and sells ATM yen puts. The company has thus created a synthetic short position in the dollar.  

The issue is that the position costs zero, since the ATM put and call will be approximately the same. The company can do better by buying 110 calls and selling puts with strike 105. This way, the company would sell dollars at least at the range of 105 to 110.  

The strategy is somewhat risky, if the realized value of $S_T$ turns out to be less than the lower strike. The payoff diagram in Figure 11.6 shows that if spot USD/JPY goes below 105, unlike the case of a regular short position, the payoff would change direction and the position would lose proportionally.  

![](93a5cc6e6e5e5c0e1a1a2b3c4d4e5f5g6h6i7j7k7l7m7n7o7p7q7r7s7t7u7v7.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.6  

Short position with different strikes.

This was a risk reversal. This position was taken because the company expects the dollar to depreciate somewhat, but still remain above 105. The company is willing to accept the risk that, if the dollar would go below 105, the short dollar payoff reverses and loses money in a long position in dollars.  

The use of options to get synthetic spot, forward, or futures exposures is common for several reasons:  

â€¢ The option strategy helps to get leveraged positions while at the same time limiting the downside risk.  
â€¢ The method may cost less in terms of transaction costs, bid-ask spreads, and commissions.  
â€¢ The strategy may be better when there are risks on other dimensions at the corporate or portfolio level.  
â€¢ The strategy permits the market professional to offer products that directly meet client's needs by adjusting the strike level(s).  

# 11.2.1.2 Arbitrage opportunity?  

The put-call parity discussed in Chapter 9 suggests that:  

$$
S_t - C_t^K + P_t^K = K e^{-r(T-t)}
$$  

where, as usual, $C_t^K$ and $P_t^K$ are European vanilla call and the put prices respectively. This relationship is "theoretical" and may not hold exactly in the real world. In fact, some practitioners may trade deviations from the put-call parity.  

## EXAMPLE  

On Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) S&P100 June expiration call and put options are trading with strike $K=370$. The actual S&P100 index is at $S_t = 370.65$. The puts are trading at $P_t^K = 5\frac{5}{8}$. Calls are at $C_t^K = 8$.  

The trader checks the put-call parity equation to see whether there is an arbitrage opportunity in holding positions for 20 days until expiration.  

According to the put-call parity, the following relationship should hold:  

$$
S_t - C_t^K + P_t^K = K e^{-r(T-t)}
$$  

With $r = 0.05$, the annual risk-free rate, and expiration $T - t = 20/365$, the relationship gives  

$$
[^370]: 65 - 8 + 5.625 = 370 e^{-r(T-t)}
$$  

The trader checks whether this relationship holds. After plugging in the numbers,  

$$
[^368]: 27 \ne 370 e^{-0.05\times20/365} = 368.992
$$  

If the two sides are not exactly the same, but they are close.9 If we include the bid-ask spread and commissions, the potential arbitrage gains due to violation of put-call parity may disappear completely.10 In fact, if options in the real world are American options, the relationship will change, and we need to incorporate the early exercise premiums.  

# 11.2.2 A REMARK ON THE PIN RISK  

One difference between the synthetic spot position and the actual spot position is the associated "pin risk". Suppose at expiration, the underlying asset ends up exactly at the strike level $K$, then neither the put nor the call will be in the money. This is actually a major risk if options are used for hedging. The hedger assumes he has a spot long or short position, but the position "disappears" at expiration. The underlying asset is said to have been "pinned" at the strike. In such cases, the hedge breaks down and the company needs to buy the required underlying in the open market at possibly unfavorable prices with short notice.  

# 11.2.3 RISK REVERSALS  

In foreign exchange markets, an important option strategy is known as risk reversal. Risk reversals can be used to create synthetic futures positions and for hedging volatility exposure.  

We begin with simple risk reversals. A foreign currency investor may have a long position in a foreign currency, or may be expecting a cash flow in the foreign currency at time $T$. These are shown in Figures 11.7a and 11.7b, respectively.  

![](41e2e3e4e5e6e7e8e9f0f1f2f3f4f5f6f7f8f9g0g1g2g3g4g5g6g7g8g9h0h1h2.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.7  

Long position in a currency.

The investor may sell a put and use the proceeds to buy a call to set up a hedge for the long position. It is possible that the call premium is more expensive than the put premium. The hedge may result in a net cost.  

A similar risk reversal is shown in Figure 11.8. This is the case of a strong dollar and the underlying risk is a long dollar position. The risk reversal is obtained by selling USD puts (i.e., buying foreign currency puts) and buying USD calls (i.e., buying foreign currency calls). If the 25-delta puts and calls in sterling are worth the same, the position will not cost anything. However, as we will see below, the premium paid for the GBP put may be lower than the GBP call premium. In this case, the risk reversal costs money. It is not a zero-cost transaction. The put and call premiums are not equal.  

![](84e5e6e7e8e9f0f1f2f3f4f5f6f7f8f9g0g1g2g3g4g5g6g7g8g9h0h1h2h3h4h5.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.8  

Risk reversal.

It should be clear that:  

â€¢ If the differences between prices of ATM calls and puts (i.e., $C_t^K - P_t^K$) is an indication of the expected direction of the spot exchange rate (i.e., the drift $\mu$ of the process), then the prices of 25-delta calls and puts indicate the expected movement in the spot rate. This is called the market sentiment.  
â€¢ In markets, if the cost of calls and puts are significantly different, the volatility of calls and puts will be different as well. Normally this is expressed as a volatility smile implying different implied volatilities for options with different moneyness. Risk reversals are therefore considered to be a way to trade the volatility skew.  

Risk reversals therefore offer a way to hedge expected receipts of foreign currency, while profiting from any extreme movements in the underlying.  

# 11.2.3.1 Uses of risk reversals  

Risk reversals are not only hedging instruments, but are also considered to be "arbitrage" strategies. We briefly discuss these two uses. A risk reversal for a long position is a strip of long calls and short puts. Such a position gains if the underlying rallies. The risk reversal for short positions is the reverse and gains if the underlying drops.  

## EXAMPLE  

A portfolio manager is expecting to receive a big allocation in a non-dollar-denominated fund. The foreign currency is currently at $S_t = 0.9860$ and the portfolio manager is long this foreign currency. Due to expected uncertainties around a referendum in the Euro zone, the portfolio manager secures some downside protection but does not want to pay a lot of premium for this protection and, as a result, sells some calls. In order to limit any gains in the foreign currency:  

â€¢ Buy 0.94 puts and sell 1.04 calls (three-month expiry)  

According to this, the portfolio manager retains a 5% gain should the foreign currency rally, and he/she does not lose anything for a 5% move below the current levels. On the other hand, should the foreign currency go below 0.94, the portfolio manager does not lose any more, but what is lost in the foreign currency value is made up by the gains on the option. The cost would be 0.5% of the notional amount as the puts are about 0.35% more expensive than the calls.  

Next, we see the use of a risk reversal as a volatility arbitrage, where the trader takes a position on the skew.  

## EXAMPLE  

Sell 0.95 put, buy 1.05 call for zero cost  
â€¢ Max profit: unlimited  
â€¢ Max loss: USD $1 - 0.95$ (assuming a base currency of 1)  
â€¢ Breakeven: $S_T = 0.95$  

If the risk reversal can be done for zero cost, the portfolio manager has obtained a volatility arbitrage. Implied volatility for the call is less than the put. If they equalize, then the trade makes money. This suggests that the trader expects the volatility skew to change. Of course, using risk reversals as a way to position on changes in the volatility smile involves significant risks. The trader is not trading volatility alone, but by having a view on the skew, this is a highly leveraged position on the underlying.  

# 11.2.4 YIELD ENHANCEMENT STRATEGIES  

Not all uses of options are for hedging the underlying exposures. At times, investors may use options to collect premiums. By selling insurance against possible adverse movements in asset prices, the investor immediately collects premiums. We consider two useful examples.  

# 11.2.4.1 Call overwriting  

Consider Figure 11.9. Suppose the investor owns an underlying asset, say a stock whose current price is $S_t$. This represents a long position. The investor decides to sell out-of-the-money calls on this stock with a strike $K_1$ in order to collect some premium. The sale (short) on the option will either expire out-of-the-money [OTM], in which case the original position is maintained and the investor has collected the option premium as an extra gain. Or, the option may be in-the-money (ITM), in which case the call is exercised and the investor delivers the stock at a price of $K_1$ to the option holder and collects $K_1$ plus any premium.  

![](91e2e3e4e5e6e7e8e9f0f1f2f3f4f5f6f7f8f9g0g1g2g3g4g5g6g7g8g9h0h1h2.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.9  

Call overwriting.

This is shown on the payoff diagram. The original payoff with slope +1 reaches a ceiling at $K_1$. The payoff then becomes flat. For strike prices $S_T < K_1$, the payoff equals that of the original long position, plus the premium collected. If the stock price exceeds $K_1$, the investor does not benefit from the stock's appreciation. On the other hand, as can be seen from the payoff diagram, this investor is still holding the original long position, so when the stock moves below $S_t$, any loss is shared by the investor one for one. Of course, the premium collected partially compensates these losses. Call overwriting, in other words, does not hedge the downside risk, but limits the upside gain by collecting some limited premium.  

## Put selling  

Selling puts can also be used for yield enhancement. For example, a portfolio manager with USD cash on hand to invest over the long term might sell ITM EUR puts, giving the buyer the right to sell EUR at a pre-agreed price. If the EUR trades higher than the put strike, the put expires worthless with no exercise and the portfolio manager would have increased returns by collecting the premium. If the puts were exercised, the portfolio manager has to buy the EUR at the pre-agreed price. If the put option is in the money, the manager's view is that the EUR is good long-term value against USD at the strike level, so he or she would be happy to own it.  

## Collars  

Another yield enhancement strategy is to buy a cap and sell a floor simultaneously or vice-versa. For instance, an investor buys an interest rate cap that limits the interest rate paid to, say, 5.5%. The investor then sells a floor, thereby obtaining an option premium to compensate for the cost of the cap. If the floor is set at, say, 2.25%, the investor will not benefit from falls in the interest rate below 2.25%.  

# 11.3 VOLATILITY-BASED STRATEGIES  

So far in this chapter we looked at traditional directional uses of options. The investor either took a view on market direction, or hedged the risk of markets moving into unwanted thresholds. Yet, one can use options to take positions on the volatility of the underlying. We remind the reader that in the case of the Black-Scholes formula, volatility was the only unknown variable that went into the pricing of the option. Obviously, the option's fair value is closely associated with the volatility (see Figure 11.10). That is, if the volatility of the underlying changes, the option's fair value will change. In this section, we look at ways of taking a position on anticipated volatility movements. We see how we can structure such positions so that our option portfolio is unlikely to lose value from movements in the underlying. The typical case is that the investor expects volatility to be significantly different from that which the market is currently expecting. This difference could be directional, i.e., rising or falling. The investor structures a trade using puts and calls with strikes and amounts such that the change in the option portfolio is not adversely affected by the change in the underlying.

The final outcome of the trade depends on the behavior of volatility. If the investor's expectation of volatility comes true, the trade makes money. The option portfolio will react to changes in volatility and benefit from it, while being "protected" from movements in the underlying.  

To see what would happen to an option if the underlying moved, we simply take the derivative

$$
\frac{\partial C}{\partial S} = \Delta = \text{Delta}
$$  

We see that if the change in the underlying $dS$ is multiplied by $\Delta$ (delta), then we get the change in the price of the option. Now we can structure portfolios with no sensitivity to movements in the underlying. If we compose a portfolio of options where the net delta equals zero, then the portfolio will be immune to movements in the underlying.  

$$
\Delta = \Delta_{\text{portfolio}} = 0
$$  

Such a portfolio is called delta-neutral. Market makers, on the other hand, use options to hedge their exposure to the underlying. If a market maker has an inventory of the underlying, then the delta of this inventory is just 1. It moves one for one with the underlying. If the marker maker now adds an option portfolio to this, such that the delta of the option is equal to minus one, then she has delta-hedged the position. The position is then delta-neutral.  

Of course, the only immutable law is change itself, and the moment the underlying moves, the delta of a delta-neutral portfolio will change. This is what we labeled gamma and the position would have gamma risk. To have immunity against small movements in the underlying, the delta-adjusted position must have a gamma of zero.  

$$
\Gamma = \frac{\partial \Delta}{\partial S} = \text{Gamma} = 0
$$  

Yet, there are other sources of risk as well. The option values change when the implied volatility, $\sigma_{imp}$, varies. This is measured by vega.  

$$
\text{Vega} = \frac{\partial C}{\partial \sigma}
$$  

Also, there is time decay of the option, measured by its theta. That is the risk that, as time passes, the option premium diminishes, everything else being equal.  

$$
\text{Theta} = \frac{\partial C}{\partial t}
$$  

Next, we look at how to structure volatility trades. Since we want to minimize the exposure against market movements, we focus on creating delta- and gamma-neutral portfolios.  

# 11.3.1 STRANGLES  

We know from the properties of the calls and puts:  

$$
\delta_{\text{call}} > 0, \quad \delta_{\text{put}} < 0
$$  

Further, we now have  

$$
\gamma_{\text{call}} = \gamma_{\text{put}} > 0
$$  

and  

$$
\text{vega}_{\text{call}} = \text{vega}_{\text{put}} > 0
$$  

Using these properties and equalities, we can create the required portfolios. Consider the following long strangle:  

â€¢ Buy an OTM put with strike $K_1$  
â€¢ Buy an OTM call with strike $K_2$  

where $K_1 < S_t < K_2$. The payoff of this portfolio is as shown in Figure 11.11.  

![](b3e4e5e6e7e8e9f0f1f2f3f4f5f6f7f8f9g0g1g2g3g4g5g6g7g8g9h0h1h2h3h4.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.11  

Long strangle.

To make this portfolio delta-neutral, we need to adjust the amounts of calls and puts. In fact, we have  

$$
\delta \times Q_{\text{call}} \times C + \delta \times Q_{\text{put}} \times P = 0
$$  

where $Q_{\text{call}}$ and $Q_{\text{put}}$ are quantities of calls and puts, respectively. This gives us the hedge ratio for the strangle:  

$$
h = \frac{Q_{\text{put}}}{Q_{\text{call}}} = -\frac{\delta_{\text{call}}}{\delta_{\text{put}}}
$$  

To make the portfolio gamma-neutral as well, we would need a third instrument, since we have two constraints with two unknowns. The portfolio would make money if implied volatility increased (goes up). The portfolio would have positive vega. The implied volatility smile and term structure matter significantly for the profitability, practical implementation, and hedging of such strategies.  

# 11.3.1.1 Uses of strangles  

Investors would use long strangles (straddles) when they expect implied volatility to increase. A market maker, on the other hand, may use the strangle to hedge a net short option position against movements in implied volatility.  

## EXAMPLE  

The use of strangles could be seen in the following FX barrier option example. USD/JPY is trading at 117.20, and a client needs protection against a weaker USD (USD/JPY going below 112.00).  

â€¢ One way to do this is to buy a USD put JPY call  
â€¢ Another is to buy a USD put JPY call knock-out (KO) at 124.00  

This would be the case where the option dies (is knocked out) if the spot goes above 124.00. Clearly, with such a possibility, the option would be cheaper. The client risks losing the option if the spot moves above 124.00.  

Now from the bank's perspective, the knock-out option is a barrier option. The bank has gamma exposure as in Figure 11.12.  

![](c4e5e6e7e8e9f0f1f2f3f4f5f6f7f8f9g0g1g2g3g4g5g6g7g8g9h0h1h2h3h4h5.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.12  

Gamma of a knock-out option.

Note that the bank has negative gamma near the barrier. To hedge this risk dynamically, the bank would have to sell low and buy high! This is clearly problematic.  

To cope with the negative gamma near the barrier, the bank buys a USD call struck at 126.00, that is, above the knock-out barrier. The result of adding the 126.00 call is shown in Figure 11.13. The result is a strangle with much less gamma exposure.  

![](d5e6e7e8e9f0f1f2f3f4f5f6f7f8f9g0g1g2g3g4g5g6g7g8g9h0h1h2h3h4h5h6.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.13  

Long strangle hedge.

# 11.3.2 STRADDLE  

A straddle is a long (short) position in a call and a put with the same strike. The special case is:  

â€¢ Buy an ATM call with strike $K$  
â€¢ Buy an ATM put with strike $K$  

The quantities are adjusted so that the portfolio is delta-neutral. Of course, the portfolio will be gamma-positive.  

# 11.3.2.1 Static or dynamic position?  

Using options to take a volatility position is not straightforward. In fact, if the options are held until maturity, the profitability of the position depends on the level of the underlying $S_T$. This seems contrary to our objective of structuring positions that depend on movement in volatility but not on the underlying. Delta neutrality, in other words, is not a sufficient condition.  

To see this, consider a long delta-neutral straddle. (This could, in fact, be any delta-neutral option position.)  

To make it realistic, consider the following setup. The underlying is $S_t = 100$. The straddle is obtained by buying ATM puts and calls with a strike of 100. To make the position realistic and simple at the same time, we start with equal numbers of the OTM call and put, and assume a zero interest rate. The ATM put has a delta of approximately -0.5; the call has a delta of approximately 0.5. This means that the at-the-money straddle is approximately delta-neutral with equal quantities of puts and calls. The put and call cost five each (these are three-month options).  

At expiration, the payoff of the straddle yields  

$$
\text{ATM call:} \quad \max(S_T - 100, 0)
$$  

$$
\text{ATM put:} \quad \max(100 - S_T, 0)
$$  

Let us calculate the payoff of this straddle at different values of the underlying at maturity. These are shown in Table 11.1.  

 | $S_T$ | Call payoff | Put payoff | Total | 
 | ------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------- | 
 | 85 | 0 | 15 | 5 | 
 | 90 | 0 | 10 | 0 | 
 | 95 | 0 | 5 | -5 | 
 | 100 | 0 | 0 | -10 | 
 | 105 | 5 | 0 | -5 | 
 | 110 | 10 | 0 | 0 | 
 | 115 | 15 | 0 | 5 | 

Table 11.1 Payoff from Straddle at Different Levels of the Underlying at Maturity  

From these calculations and the corresponding Figure 11.13 we see that, if the options are held until maturity (static position), then profitability depends on the level of the underlying at maturity. It is not fully hedged against movements in the underlying, even though the position was structured delta-neutral. The reason is that keeping options until maturity means that the delta of the position changes, and this would need to be corrected via dynamic hedging. The way to keep the position delta-neutral is to adjust the portfolio dynamically and maintain delta neutrality at all points in time.  

Suppose initial volatility in this example was 20% annual, and the trader expected this to increase to 30%. Now we can quantify the bet.  

Ignoring interest rates, the initial value of the portfolio is:  

$$
C_{20\%} + P_{20\%} = 5 + 5 = 10
$$  

If implied volatility goes up to 30%, the new values of the ATM call and put are (using Black-Scholes with zero interest rate and zero dividend yield)  

$$
C_{30\%} = 7.5, \quad P_{30\%} = 7.5
$$  

That is, the increase in volatility results in a value of the portfolio of 15 versus the original cost of 10. The bet would make money if volatility increased quickly enough (see the following section on theta).  

As a comparison, let us work out what happens to delta with this increase in volatility. The initial call delta is 0.55, while the initial put delta is -0.45. So, the combined delta (assuming unit quantities of the put and call) is 0.1. If volatility goes up to 30%, the new delta of the call is 0.57 and the put is now -0.43. The combined delta is 0.14. This change in delta (the gamma) would need to be hedged to maintain delta neutrality. In brief, straddles and strangles can be used to bet on views of volatility dynamically. The bet depends only on implied volatility if the position is kept delta-neutral at all times. This dynamic hedging problem is discussed further in Chapter 12.  

So, there is a significant difference between static and dynamic volatility positions. A static position held until maturity essentially requires the underlying to move by a certain amount. If the implied volatility incorporates this expected movement on average, then the position does not really depend only on the volatility.  

Dynamic positions maintained delta-neutral (i.e., delta-hedged) throughout their lives, imply bets on the implied volatility only. It is for this reason that option desks and risk managers calculate vega. This indicates the sensitivity to changes in implied volatility. They would also calculate a veta (vega decay), which is the change in vega as time passes.  

$$
\text{Veta} = \frac{\partial[^2] C}{\partial \sigma \partial t}
$$  

$$
\text{Veta} = \frac{\partial \text{vega}}{\partial t}
$$  

# 11.3.3 BUTTERFLY  

Yet another way to take positions on expected movements of implied volatility is via the butterfly. We consider a symmetric butterfly. This is made up of:  

â€¢ Buy 1 ITM call with strike $K_1$  
â€¢ Buy 1 OTM call with strike $K_3$  
â€¢ Sell 2 ATM calls with strike $K_2$  

where $K_2 = \frac{K_1 + K_3}{2}$. In other words, the center strike is equidistant from the two outer strikes. The value of this position is shown in Figure 11.14. Note that the payoff somewhat resembles the shape of a butterfly.  

![](e6e7e8e9f0f1f2f3f4f5f6f7f8f9g0g1g2g3g4g5g6g7g8g9h0h1h2h3h4h5h6h7.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.14  

Long butterfly.

The maximum payoff of a long butterfly position is at the center strike. Again to be fully delta-hedged, the butterfly position would need to be dynamically adjusted.  

However, there are other factors that need to be incorporated into the pricing and hedging of the long butterfly. This position has limited upside versus the straddle. So, butterflies are suitable when the underlying is not expected to move much. For this reason, the long butterfly for a realized payoff perspective is said to be "short volatility."11 See Taleb (1997).  

Further, different strikes have different implied volatilities (the volatility smile). The outer strikes usually have higher implied volatilities, and this needs to be hedged.  

The following example shows how a market maker would use a butterfly to hedge an exotic option exposure.  

## EXAMPLE  

Suppose the market maker sells a digital call that pays $1 if the spot is above the strike $H$. The market maker needs to hedge this risk.  

The market maker can approximate the digital call by using a call spread. He can buy a call with strike $(H-0.01)$ and sell a call with strike $(H+0.01)$. This would give the spread that approximates the payoff.  

However, the call spread doesn't hedge the risk exactly; it doesn't look exactly like the digital call. So we keep adding to the structure. The portfolio is:  

â€¢ Long 0.5 calls with strike $(H-0.02)$  
â€¢ Short 1 call with strike $(H-0.01)$  
â€¢ Short 1 call with strike $(H+0.01)$  
â€¢ Long 0.5 calls with strike $(H+0.02)$  

The approximation of the digital payoff by the butterfly is shown in Figure 11.15.  

![](f7e8e9f0f1f2f3f4f5f6f7f8f9g0g1g2g3g4g5g6g7g8g9h0h1h2h3h4h5h6h7h8.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.15  

Butterfly approximation to digital option.

# 11.4 EXOTICS  

The discussion thus far considered portfolios of vanilla options that were used for various objectives. The portfolios were static and did not require dynamic adjustments in continuous time.  

Next, we discuss structured products that require dynamic hedging. These are called exotic options. During the last decade, dealers began offering several types of options that have more complicated payoffs than plain vanilla puts and calls. Among the most liquid are barrier options, digital options, and emerging market exotics.  

Exotic options are generally more complicated to price and hedge than vanilla options. The challenge for trading and risk-managing desks is that the hedge parameters may be discontinuous (e.g., digital options) or may reverse sign and be unbounded (e.g., the gamma of a knock-out option near the barrier). Further, the hedge parameters usually exhibit a nonlinear dependence on volatility so the volatility exposure of exotic options is more complex. Not only does the exotic option depend on the implied volatility of the underlying, but the hedge parameters have a term structure, strike structure, and so on.  

# 11.4.1 BINARY, OR DIGITAL, OPTIONS  

Consider an option with the simplified payoff shown in Figure 11.16:  

$$
f(S_T) = \begin{cases} 
A & \text{if } S_{t_0} \leq K \\
A & \text{if } S_T < S_{t_0} \\
[^0]: & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$  

where $t_0$ is a base period and $S_{t_0}$ is the price at time $t_0$. This option pays the cash amount $A$ if the underlying price $S_T$ is in the range $(K, S_{t_0})$ and zero otherwise. Such an option is called a digital or binary option.  

![](g8e9f0f1f2f3f4f5f6f7f8f9g0g1g2g3g4g5g6g7g8g9h0h1h2h3h4h5h6h7h8h9.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.16  

Option on a range.

# 11.4.1.1 A binary call  

A binary call option pays $1 if the underlying settles above the strike price at maturity. The payoff of the binary option is  

$$
f(S_T) = \begin{cases} 
\$1 & \text{if } S_T > K \\
\$0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$  

This payoff is shown in Figure 11.17.  

![](h9f0f1f2f3f4f5f6f7f8f9g0g1g2g3g4g5g6g7g8g9h0h1h2h3h4h5h6h7h8h9i0.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.17  

Binary call option.

# 11.4.1.2 Replicating the binary call  

The payoff of the binary call looks quite different from the payoff of a vanilla call option and presents some challenges during pricing and hedging. As is well known, the binary call is not spanned by a single vanilla option if markets are complete and arbitrage-free. That is, we cannot perfectly replicate a binary option using a static position in vanilla options.  

For replication purposes, we need to use a portfolio of vanilla options. It turns out that the payoff of a binary call is approximately the same as that of a call spread.  

## Option 1  

The replicating portfolio contains  

â€¢ Long 1 call with strike $K$ with value $c(K)$  
â€¢ Short 1 call with strike $(K+\epsilon)$ with value $c(K+\epsilon)$  

where $\epsilon$ is small. The value of this portfolio is  

$$
V = c(K) - c(K+\epsilon)
$$  

The payoff of the portfolio is  

$$
\text{Payoff} = \max(S_T - K, 0) - \max(S_T - (K+\epsilon), 0)
$$  

Expanding this:  

$$
\text{Payoff} = \begin{cases} 
[^0]: & \text{if } S_T < K \\
S_T - K & \text{if } K < S_T < K+\epsilon \\
\epsilon & \text{if } S_T > K+\epsilon
\end{cases}
$$  

As $\epsilon \to 0$, the payoff of this portfolio approximates the payoff of a binary call that pays $\epsilon$. To get a payoff of $1, we would need to buy $1/\epsilon$ of these portfolios.  

## Option 2  

Another way to see this is to recall the following definition of a derivative:  

$$
\frac{\partial c}{\partial K} = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \frac{c(K+\epsilon) - c(K)}{\epsilon}
$$  

where we used the fact that $c(K+\epsilon) \approx c(K) + \frac{\partial c}{\partial K} \cdot \epsilon$.  

Since the binary call can be approximately replicated by buying $(1/\epsilon)$ call spreads, its value is  

$$
V_{binary} = \frac{1}{\epsilon}[c(K) - c(K+\epsilon)]
$$  

$$
V_{binary} = -\frac{c(K+\epsilon) - c(K)}{\epsilon}
$$  

As $\epsilon \to 0$:  

$$
V_{binary} = -\frac{\partial c}{\partial K}
$$  

Thus, the value of a binary call is the negative of the derivative of a vanilla call with respect to the strike.  

Using the Black-Scholes formula, we can compute  

$$
\frac{\partial c}{\partial K} = -e^{-r(T-t)} N(d_2)
$$  

where $N(.)$ is the cumulative standard normal distribution and  

$$
d_2 = \frac{\ln(S_t/K) + (r - \sigma[^2]/2)(T-t)}{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}
$$  

Therefore, the value of a binary call is  

$$
V_{binary} = e^{-r(T-t)} N(d_2)
$$  

# 11.4.1.3 Delta and price of binaries  

Given the derivation above, we see that the value of a binary call is just the discounted probability that the option ends up in the money. The delta of the binary is the derivative with respect to the underlying:  

$$
\Delta_{binary} = \frac{\partial V_{binary}}{\partial S} = e^{-r(T-t)} \frac{N'(d_2)}{S\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}
$$  

where $N'(.)$ is the standard normal density function.  

As seen from Figure 11.18, the delta of the binary option is quite large near the strike. Intuitively, for near-the-money binary options, a small change in the underlying can change the payoff from 0 to 1, leading to a large delta.  

![](i0i1i2i3i4i5i6i7i8i9j0j1j2j3j4j5j6j7j8j9k0k1k2k3k4k5k6k7k8k9l0l1l2.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.18  

Delta of binary option.

In fact, notice that as $\sigma \to 0$ or $(T-t) \to 0$ (near maturity), the delta of the binary option approaches infinity when $S_t = K$. From a risk management perspective, this can make binary options difficult to hedge near the strike.  

# 11.4.1.4 Time value of binaries  

The theta of a binary option has an interesting property. For options that are sufficiently out-of-the-money or in-the-money, the theta is negative, meaning the option loses value as time passes. This is intuitive since time decay works against the holder.  

However, for near-the-money binary options, the theta can be positive. This is because the high gamma near the strike means that time passing makes the option more valuable due to increased probability of finishing in the money.  

# 11.4.1.5 Uses of the binary  

Binary options can be used in various ways:  

[^1]: **Structured products**: Binary options can be combined with vanilla options to create various payoff profiles. For example, adding a binary option to a vanilla option can create a "booster" that enhances payoffs in certain ranges.

[^2]: **Correlation trades**: Binary options on one underlying can be combined with vanilla options on another to create correlation-dependent payoffs.

[^3]: **View expression**: Binary options provide a direct way to express a view that an underlying will be above or below a certain level at maturity.

The pricing and hedging of binary options is particularly sensitive to the implied volatility near the strike, as well as to jumps in the underlying. Market makers often charge wider spreads for binary options due to these hedging difficulties.  

# 11.4.2 BARRIER OPTIONS  

Barrier options are path-dependent options where the payoff depends not only on the final value of the underlying but also on whether the underlying touched a certain barrier level during the life of the option.  

The main types of barrier options are:  

â€¢ **Knock-out options**: These options cease to exist if the barrier is touched  
â€¢ **Knock-in options**: These options come into existence only if the barrier is touched  

Each type can be further classified as:  

â€¢ **Up-and-out/Up-and-in**: Barrier is above the current spot  
â€¢ **Down-and-out/Down-and-in**: Barrier is below the current spot  

For example, an up-and-out call option pays $\max(S_T - K, 0)$ if the barrier $H > S_0$ is never touched during the life of the option; otherwise, it pays zero.  

These options are popular because:  

[^1]: They are cheaper than vanilla options (for knock-outs)
[^2]: They provide more targeted hedging for specific views
[^3]: They can be structured to match natural business exposures

The pricing of barrier options must account for the possibility of the barrier being touched at any time during the option's life, making them more complex than vanilla options.  

# 11.4.2.1 A contractual equation  

An important relationship exists between knock-in and knock-out options. For a given barrier $H$ and strike $K$:  

$$
\text{Knock-in call} + \text{Knock-out call} = \text{Vanilla call}
$$  

This relationship, known as the barrier parity, states that a knock-in option plus a knock-out option with the same barrier and strike is equivalent to a vanilla option.  

This makes intuitive sense: either the barrier is touched (knock-in activates, knock-out deactivates) or it isn't (knock-in doesn't activate, knock-out remains active). In either case, you end up with one active option, equivalent to holding a vanilla option.  

## EXAMPLE  

Consider a one-year USD/JPY up-and-out call option with:  
â€¢ Current spot: 110  
â€¢ Strike: 115  
â€¢ Barrier: 120  

This option will pay $\max(S_T - 115, 0)$ only if USD/JPY never touches 120 during the year. If it touches 120 at any point, the option is knocked out and becomes worthless.  

Such options are useful for:  
â€¢ Corporates hedging FX risk but willing to forgo protection if rates move strongly in their favor  
â€¢ Investors expressing specific views on range-bound markets  
â€¢ Reducing hedging costs compared to vanilla options  

# 11.4.2.2 Some uses of barrier options  

[^1]: **Cost reduction**: Knock-out options are cheaper than vanilla options, making them attractive for hedging.

[^2]: **Natural hedges**: Some businesses have natural barriers in their exposures. For example, an exporter might only need protection if exchange rates stay within a certain range.

[^3]: **Yield enhancement**: Investors can sell knock-in options to collect premium, with the option only activating if markets move significantly.

[^4]: **Structured products**: Barrier options are key components in many structured products, providing customized payoffs for retail and institutional clients.

## EXAMPLE  

An oil producer wants to hedge against declining oil prices but is willing to forgo protection if prices rise above $80/barrel (they're happy with high prices). They buy a down-and-out put with:  
â€¢ Strike: $60  
â€¢ Barrier: $80  
â€¢ Current price: $70  

This provides protection against prices falling below $60, but only if prices never rise above $80. This is cheaper than a vanilla put and matches the producer's risk profile.  

# 11.4.3 NEW RISKS  

Exotic options introduce several new risks:  

[^1]: **Discontinuous hedges**: The hedge ratios of barrier and binary options can be discontinuous, making dynamic hedging challenging.

[^2]: **Model risk**: Exotic options are more sensitive to modeling assumptions, particularly regarding the dynamics of volatility.

[^3]: **Liquidity risk**: The market for exotic options is less liquid than for vanilla options, potentially leading to wider bid-ask spreads.

[^4]: **Correlation risk**: Many exotic options depend on correlations between different risk factors, which can be unstable.

[^5]: **Gap risk**: Markets can gap through barrier levels or binary strikes, leading to hedging losses.

These risks require sophisticated risk management systems and often result in wider profit margins for market makers.  

# 11.5 QUOTING CONVENTIONS  

Options markets have developed specific conventions for quoting prices that vary by asset class and market. Understanding these conventions is crucial for traders and risk managers.  

## Foreign Exchange Options  

FX options are typically quoted in terms of implied volatility rather than prices. The standard quotation includes:  

[^1]: **At-the-money (ATM) volatility**: Usually delta-neutral straddle volatility
[^2]: **Risk reversals**: The difference in implied volatility between OTM calls and puts
[^3]: **Butterfly spreads**: The average implied volatility of OTM options minus ATM volatility

This three-point volatility surface provides enough information to interpolate the entire volatility smile.  

## Equity Options  

Equity options are often quoted in terms of:  

[^1]: **Implied volatility** for liquid stocks
[^2]: **Price** for less liquid names
[^3]: **Delta** for some exotic structures

The quotation typically specifies whether European or American exercise is assumed.  

## Interest Rate Options  

Interest rate options use various quoting conventions:  

[^1]: **Normal (basis point) volatility** for options on rates
[^2]: **Lognormal (percentage) volatility** for options on prices
[^3]: **Forward premium** for some structures

These differences reflect the different dynamics of interest rates at various levels (negative rates require normal models).  

## Commodity Options  

Commodity options may be quoted in:  

[^1]: **Implied volatility**
[^2]: **Premium per unit** (e.g., cents per bushel)
[^3]: **Percentage of underlying**

The convention often depends on the commodity and the market participant (producer vs. financial investor).  

Understanding these conventions is essential for:  
â€¢ Comparing prices across markets  
â€¢ Implementing trading strategies  
â€¢ Managing risk in a portfolio  
â€¢ Communicating with brokers and counterparties  

# 11.5.1 EXAMPLE 1  

Consider a EUR/USD options market where:  
â€¢ Spot: 1.2000  
â€¢ ATM volatility (1 month): 10%  
â€¢ 25-delta risk reversal: -1% (EUR calls trade below EUR puts)  
â€¢ 25-delta butterfly: +0.5%  

From these quotes, we can infer:  
â€¢ The market expects EUR to weaken (negative risk reversal)  
â€¢ There's a volatility smile (positive butterfly)  
â€¢ OTM EUR puts have ~11% implied volatility  
â€¢ OTM EUR calls have ~10% implied volatility  
â€¢ ATM options have 10% implied volatility  

# 11.5.2 EXAMPLE 2  

An equity index option market might quote:  
â€¢ ATM implied volatility: 20%  
â€¢ Put skew: -2% per 10% OTM  
â€¢ Term structure: +0.5% per month  

This tells us:  
â€¢ Near-term ATM options trade at 20% volatility  
â€¢ 90% strike puts trade at ~22% volatility  
â€¢ Longer-dated options have higher implied volatility  
â€¢ The market is pricing in downside risk (negative skew)  

# 11.6 REAL-WORLD COMPLICATIONS  

# 11.6.1 THE ROLE OF THE VOLATILITY SMILE  

In practice, the Black-Scholes assumption of constant volatility is violated. The implied volatility varies with both strike and maturity, creating a volatility surface. This has several implications:  

[^1]: **Pricing**: Options must be priced using the appropriate implied volatility for their strike and maturity.

[^2]: **Hedging**: The hedge ratios must account for the movement of the volatility smile as the underlying moves.

[^3]: **Risk management**: Portfolios have exposure not just to the level of volatility but to the shape of the smile.

[^4]: **Arbitrage**: The smile must be arbitrage-free, imposing constraints on the relative prices of options.

The volatility smile is particularly pronounced in:  
â€¢ FX markets (due to jump risk and interest rate differentials)  
â€¢ Equity index options (due to crash risk)  
â€¢ Commodity markets (due to supply/demand shocks)  

Managing smile risk requires sophisticated models and systems, making it a key differentiator among options traders.  

# 11.6.2 EXISTENCE OF POSITION LIMITS  

Regulatory and exchange-imposed position limits create additional complications:  

[^1]: **Concentration risk**: Limits prevent excessive concentration in particular options.

[^2]: **Hedging constraints**: Large hedgers may need to use multiple instruments or markets.

[^3]: **Roll risk**: Positions may need to be rolled to different maturities to stay within limits.

[^4]: **Reporting requirements**: Positions above certain thresholds must be reported to regulators.

[^5]: **Market impact**: Large positions near limits can affect market dynamics.

Position limits vary by:  
â€¢ Asset class  
â€¢ Exchange  
â€¢ Participant type (hedger vs. speculator)  
â€¢ Account type (proprietary vs. customer)  

Understanding and managing position limits is crucial for:  
â€¢ Large trading operations  
â€¢ Market makers  
â€¢ Institutional hedgers  
â€¢ Risk managers  

# 11.7 CONCLUSIONS  

Options provide powerful tools for financial engineering, enabling:  
â€¢ Precise risk management  
â€¢ Leveraged speculation  
â€¢ Volatility trading  
â€¢ Structured product creation  

The key insights from this chapter include:  

[^1]: Options can replicate any desired payoff profile through appropriate portfolio construction.

[^2]: Directional strategies use options to express views on market direction with limited downside or enhanced leverage.

[^3]: Volatility strategies enable trading without taking directional risk when dynamically hedged.

[^4]: Exotic options provide more efficient ways to achieve specific objectives but introduce new risks.

[^5]: Real-world complications like volatility smiles and position limits must be carefully managed.

The successful application of options in financial engineering requires:  
â€¢ Deep understanding of pricing models and their limitations  
â€¢ Sophisticated risk management systems  
â€¢ Awareness of market conventions and regulations  
â€¢ Ability to dynamically hedge complex portfolios  

As markets continue to evolve, new option structures and strategies will emerge, but the fundamental principles of option engineering will remain essential for financial professionals.

# EXERCISES  

[^1]: Consider a stock trading at $100. Six-month ATM options have 30% implied volatility.
   a) Calculate the price of ATM calls and puts  
   b) Verify put-call parity  
   c) What is the delta of each option?  

[^2]: Design a strategy for an investor who:
   a) Expects the market to rise moderately  
   b) Wants to limit downside risk  
   c) Is willing to cap upside gains  
   What options would you use? Draw the payoff diagram.  

[^3]: Create a delta-neutral straddle when:
   â€¢ Stock price: $50  
   â€¢ Strike: $50  
   â€¢ Call delta: 0.55  
   â€¢ Put delta: -0.45  
   How many puts do you need per call?  

[^4]: A binary call option pays $1 if S_T > 100. Current stock price is $95.
   a) Replicate this using vanilla options  
   b) What happens to the hedge as we approach maturity?  
   c) Why might this be difficult to hedge in practice?  

[^5]: Compare and contrast:
   a) Long straddle vs. long strangle  
   b) Risk reversal vs. collar  
   c) Butterfly vs. condor  
   When would you use each strategy?
