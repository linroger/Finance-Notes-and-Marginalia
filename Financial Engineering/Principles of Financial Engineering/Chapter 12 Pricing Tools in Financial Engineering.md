# 12.1 INTRODUCTION  

We have thus far proceeded without a discussion of asset pricing models and the tools associated with them, as financial engineering has many important dimensions besides pricing. In this chapter, we will discuss models of asset pricing, albeit in a very simple context. A summary chapter on pricing tools would unify some of the previous topics and show the subtle connections between them. The discussion will approach the issue using a framework that is a natural extension of the financial engineering logic utilized thus far.  

Pricing comes with at least two problems that seem, at first, difficult to surmount in any satisfactory way. Investors like return, but dislike risk. This means that assets associated with nondiversifiable risks will carry risk premia. But, how can we measure such risk premia objectively when buying assets is essentially a matter of subjective preferences? Modeling risk premia using utility functions may be feasible theoretically, but this is not attractive from a trader's point of view if hundreds of millions of dollars are involved in the process. The potential relationship between risk premia and utility functions of players in the markets is the first unpleasant aspect of practical pricing decisions.  

The second problem follows from the first. One way or another, the pricing approach needs to be based on measuring the volatility of future cash flows. But volatility is associated with randomness and with some probability distribution. How can an asset pricing approach that intends to be applicable in practice obtain a reasonable set of real-world probabilities?  

Modern finance has found an ingenious and practical way of dealing with both these questions simultaneously. Instead of using a framework where risk premia are modeled explicitly, the profession transforms a problem with risk premia into one where there are no risk premia. Interestingly, this transformation is done in a way that the relevant probability distribution ceases to be the real-world probability and, instead, becomes a market-determined probability that can be numerically calculated at any point in time if there is a reasonable number of liquid instruments. With this approach, the assets will be priced in an artificial risk-neutral environment where the risk premia are indirectly taken into account. This methodology is labeled the Martingale approach. It is a powerful tool in practical asset pricing and risk management.  

A newcomer to financial engineering may find it hard to believe that a more or less unified theory for pricing financial assets that can be successfully applied in real-world pricing actually exists. After all, there are many different types of assets, and not all of them seem amenable to the same pricing methodology, even at a theoretical level. A market practitioner may already have heard of risk-neutral pricing, but just like the newcomer to financial engineering, he or she may regard the basic theory behind it as very abstract. And yet, the theory is surprisingly potent. This chapter provides a discussion of this methodology from the point of view of a financial engineer. Hence, even though the topic is asset pricing, the way we approach it is based on ideas developed in previous chapters. Basically, this pricing methodology is presented as a general approach to synthetic asset creation.  

Of course, like any other theory, this methodology depends on some strict assumptions. The methods used in this text will uniformly make one common assumption that needs to be pointed out at the start. Only those models that assume complete markets are discussed. In heuristic terms, when markets are "complete," there are "enough" liquid instruments for obtaining the working probability distribution.  

This chapter progressively introduces a number of important theoretical results that are used in pricing, hedging, and risk-management application. The main result is called the fundamental theorem of asset pricing. Instead of a mathematical proof, we use a financial engineering argument to justify it, and a number of important consequences will emerge. Throughout the chapter, we will single out the results that have practical implications.  

# 12.2 SUMMARY OF PRICING APPROACHES  

In this section, we remind the reader of some important issues from earlier chapters. Suppose we want to find the fair market price of an instrument. First, we construct a synthetic equivalent to this instrument using liquid contracts that trade in financial markets. Clearly, this requires that such contracts are indeed available. Second, once these liquid contracts are found, an arbitrage argument is used. The cost of the replicating portfolio should equal the cost of the instrument we are trying to price. Third, a trader would add a proper margin to this cost and thus obtain the fair price.  

In earlier chapters, we obtained synthetics for forward rate agreements (FRAs), foreign exchange (FX) forwards, and several other quasi-linear instruments. Each of these constitutes an early example of asset pricing. Obtain the synthetic and see how much it costs. By adding a profit to this cost, the fair market price is obtained. It turns out that we can extend this practical approach and obtain a general theory.  

It should be reemphasized that pricing and hedging efforts can sometimes be regarded as two sides of the same coin. In fact, hedging a product requires finding a replicating portfolio and then using it to cover the position in the original asset. If the trader is long in the original instrument, he or she would be short in the synthetic, and vice versa. This way, exposures to risks would cancel out and the position would become "riskless." This process results in the creation of a replicating portfolio whose cost cannot be that different from the price of the original asset. Thus, a hedge will transfer unwanted risks to other parties but, at the same time, will provide a way to price the original asset.  

Pricing theory is also useful for the creation of "new products." A new product is basically a series of contingent cash flows. We would, first, put together a combination of financial instruments that have the same cash flows. Then, we would write a separate contract and sell these cash flows to others under a new name. For example, a strip of FRAs or futures can be purchased and resulting cash flows are then labeled a swap and sold to others. The new product is, in fact, a dynamically maintained portfolio of existing instruments, and its fair cost will equal the sum of the price of its constituents.  

# 12.3 THE FRAMEWORK  

The pricing framework that we use emphasizes important aspects of the theory within a real-world setting. We assume that $m$ liquid asset prices are observed at times $t_{i}$, $i=1, 2, \ldots$. The time $t_{i}$ price of the kth asset is denoted by $S_{kt_{i}}$. The latter can represent credit, stocks, fixed-income instruments, the corresponding derivatives, or commodity prices.  

In theory, a typical $S_{kt_{i}}$ can assume any real value. This makes the number of possible values infinite and uncountable. But in practice, every price is quoted to a small number of decimal places and, hence, has a countable number of possible future values. FX rates, for example, are in general quoted to four decimal places. This brings us to the next important notion that we would like to introduce.  

# 12.3.1 STATES OF THE WORLD  

Let $t_{0}$ denote the "present," and consider the kth asset price $S_{kT}$, at a future date, $T=t_{i}$, for some $0<i$. At time $t_{0}$, $S_{kT}$ will be a random variable. Let the symbol $\omega^{j}$, with $j=1,\ldots,n$ represent time $T$ states of the world that relate to the random variable $S_{kT}$. We assume that $n \leq m$, which amounts to saying that there are at least as many liquid assets as there are time $T$ states of the world. For example, it is common practice in financial markets to assume a "bullish" state, a "bearish" state, and a "no-change" state. Traders expect prices in the future to be either "higher," "lower," or to "remain the same." The $\omega^{j}$ generalizes this characterization and makes it operational.  

## EXAMPLE  

In this example, we construct the states of the world that relate to some asset whose time $t_{i}$ price is denoted by $S_{t_{i}}$. Without any loss of generality, let  
$$
S_{t_{0}}=100
$$  

Suppose, at a future date $T$, with $t_{n}=T$, there are only $n=4$ states of the world. We consider the task of defining these states.  

[^1]: Set the value of some grid parameter $\Delta S$ to assign neighboring values of $S_{T}$ into a single state. For example, let
$$
\Delta S=2
$$  

[^2]: Next define the relevant intervals:
The first state of the world is the event  
$$
\omega^{1}=\{95<S_{T}<97\}
$$  

The second is  
$$
\omega^{2}=\{97<S_{T}<99\}
$$  

The third and fourth states can be defined as  
$$
\omega^{3}=\{99<S_{T}<103\}
$$  
$$
\omega^{4}=\{103<S_{T}<107\}
$$  

[^3]: These are the states of the world. Note that the $\omega^{j}$ are non-intersecting and "fill" the range considered. As $\Delta S \to 0$, the states become more numerous and eventually converge to the uncountable case. In practice, $S_{T}$ has a "minimum tick," i.e., a smallest amount by which it can change, and the $\omega^{j}$ can be selected accordingly.

This discussion has two immediate implications. First, the notion of a state is in fact quite convenient. We partition all possible values of an asset price into a small number of states, and then use these to define various other concepts. Second, we obtained a simple framework where asset prices, or returns, at time $T$ are described by how much they are worth in the $n$ different states of the world. During the following discussion, financial payoffs will be state-dependent. An investor will receive different payments in different states of the world. We now provide another example.  

## EXAMPLE  

Suppose a professional investor buys an FX option that expires at a future date $T = t_{10}$. The option is written on the euro/dollar exchange rate, $e_{t}$, which is quoted as the number of dollars per one euro. At time $t_{0}$, $e_{0}=0.900$. The professional investor buys a European style call that will give him or her the right to buy 1 million euros at the strike exchange rate $e^{*}=0.920$ if the option expires in-the-money. Let $C_{t}$ denote the price of this option.  

We divide all possible values of $e_{T}$ into three states. The first state of the world will lead to "low" values of $e_{T}$. We define it as  
$$
\omega^{1}=\{e_{T}<0.920\}
$$  

In this state, the option will expire out-of-the-money.  

The second state of the world consists of "medium" values of the exchange rate:  
$$
\omega^{2}=\{0.920\leq e_{T}<0.950\}
$$  

The third state consists of "high" values of the exchange rate:  
$$
\omega^{3}=\{0.950\leq e_{T}\}
$$  

What is the payoff of the option at time $T$? Well, the payoff depends on which state is realized. In the first state, the $C_{T}$ will expire out-of-the-money and the option holder will receive nothing:  
$$
C_{T}(\omega^{1})=0
$$  

If the second state is realized, the option will expire in-the-money. The option holder can buy 1 million euros at 92 cents, and sell them at the market price, which is higher than 92 cents. The option payoff will be  
$$
C_{T}(\omega^{2})=1,000,000[e_{T}-0.920]
$$  

If the third state is realized, the option is again in-the-money and the payoff will be  
$$
C_{T}(\omega^{3})=1,000,000[e_{T}-0.920]
$$  

That is to say, given the described states of the world, the option has the payoffs  
$$
C_{T} = \begin{cases}
[^0]: & \text{if } \omega^{1} \text{ is realized} \\
[^1]: ,000,000[e_{T}-0.920] & \text{if } \omega^{2} \text{ is realized} \\
[^1]: ,000,000[e_{T}-0.920] & \text{if } \omega^{3} \text{ is realized}
\end{cases}
$$  

This representation of option payoff is not the same as the one discussed in Chapter 9. There, the option payoff at expiration was described by the formula  
$$
C_{T}=\max[e_{T}-0.920, 0]
$$  

which gives the payoff of the option at time $T$ as a continuous function of the exchange rate. The representation in this example lists option payoffs over a partition of exchange rate values.  

# 12.3.2 THE PAYOFF MATRIX  

The argument presented above can be generalized. Suppose we have $m$ liquid assets labeled with $k = 1, 2, \ldots, m$. In each state of the world $\omega^{j}$, $j = 1, \ldots, n$, asset $k$ will have the numerical value $S_{kT}^{j}$. These numbers can be placed into a matrix to obtain a tabular representation of what each asset would be worth in each state:  

$$
D = \begin{bmatrix}
S_{1T}^{1} & S_{1T}^{2} & \cdots & S_{1T}^{n} \\
S_{2T}^{1} & S_{2T}^{2} & \cdots & S_{2T}^{n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
S_{mT}^{1} & S_{mT}^{2} & \cdots & S_{mT}^{n}
\end{bmatrix}
$$  

In this matrix, the rows represent the assets and the columns represent the states of the world. The elements of the kth row are what the kth asset is worth in different states of the world. Suppose the first asset is a risk-free security such as a Treasury bill, and that interest rates are constant at r. Assuming that the current price is $S_{1t_{0}}$, we have  
$$
S_{1T}^{1} = S_{1T}^{2} = \cdots = S_{1T}^{n} = S_{1t_{0}}(1+r)^{T-t_{0}}
$$  

So the first row of the payoff matrix will consist of the same number in all states. The kth row, on the other hand, represents a risky asset and will have different values in each state:  
$$
S_{kT}^{1} < S_{kT}^{2} < \cdots < S_{kT}^{n}
$$  

assuming that the states are ranked from "worst" to "best" market performance. We call this matrix the payoff matrix or the table of asset returns. In mathematical treatments of asset pricing, the matrix $D$ is also referred to as the dividend matrix because in a stock market setting, the $S_{kT}^{j}$ will represent the price and the accompanying dividends to be earned at time $T$. If the risk-free asset is selected to be a $T$-maturity pure discount bond with face value \$1, then the matrix in Equation (12.4) will have its first row equal to 1 in all states.  

# 12.3.3 THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM  

In this section, we state the first fundamental theorem of asset pricing. Let the pricing functions (see below) for time $t_{0}$ and time $T$ be denoted by the vectors $[\psi^{1}, \psi^{2}, \ldots, \psi^{n}]$ and $[\psi_{T}^{1}, \psi_{T}^{2}, \ldots, \psi_{T}^{n}]$, respectively. The fundamental theorem says  

If the financial markets under consideration do not permit any arbitrage opportunities, then there exists positive constants $\{\psi^{j}\}$, $j = 1, \ldots, n$, such that the price of each asset can be expressed as  

$$
S_{kt_{0}} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \psi^{j} S_{kT}^{j}
$$  

or, in matrix form  
$$
S_{t_{0}} = D \Psi
$$  

where $S_{t_{0}}$ is the vector of prices at time $t_{0}$, and $\Psi = [\psi^{1}, \ldots, \psi^{n}]'$. If a bank account is one of the available assets, then the discount factor for one dollar paid at time $T$ is given by  
$$
d(t_{0}, T) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \psi^{j}
$$  

An immediate corollary follows as a result:  

If and only if no arbitrage possibilities exist, there will be positive constants $\{Q^{j}\}$, $j = 1, \ldots, n$, such that the normalized price of each asset at time $t_{0}$ is given by the weighted sum  
$$
S_{kt_{0}} = B_{0,T} \sum_{j=1}^{n} Q^{j} S_{kT}^{j}
$$  

where $B_{0,T}$ is the time-$t_{0}$ price of a T-maturity pure discount bond.  

The weights $\{Q^{j}\}$ sum to one. We call $Q^{j}$ the state prices because, according to this representation, prices of all assets will be linear combinations of these same weights. State prices summarize all the information needed to price securities linearly as long as arbitrage opportunities do not exist.  

# 12.3.4 DEFINITION OF AN ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITY  

A portfolio $\theta = \{\theta^{1}, \ldots, \theta^{m}\}$ is said to offer a Type 1 arbitrage opportunity if it does not require any initial investment and has positive value in the future with positive probability. That is,  
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{m} \theta^{k} S_{kt_{0}} = 0
$$  
and  
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{m} \theta^{k} S_{kT}^{j} \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } j
$$  
with strict inequality for at least one $j$.  

Similarly, a portfolio $\theta = \{\theta^{1}, \ldots, \theta^{m}\}$ is said to offer a Type 2 arbitrage opportunity if it requires a negative initial investment (i.e., it has positive initial income) and has a zero or positive value in the future with certainty. That is,  
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{m} \theta^{k} S_{kt_{0}} < 0
$$  
and  
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{m} \theta^{k} S_{kT}^{j} \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } j
$$  

# 12.3.5 INTERPRETING THE $Q^{j}$: STATE PRICES  

The state prices $\{Q^{j}\}$ obviously play an important role. According to the fundamental theorem, these (positive) weights are sufficient to price all assets in a linear fashion. An immediate question is: Do the $Q^{j}$ represent some sort of probabilities? If so, whose probabilities are they? Also, where do they come from? In the following discussion, we clarify these questions. We begin with the second fundamental theorem:  

Arbitrage opportunities are completely eliminated if and only if there exists a unique set of positive state prices $\{Q^{j}, j = 1, \ldots, n\}$.  

Note that the $\{Q^{j}\}$ will be unique if the markets are complete. When markets are complete, the number of states $n$ equals the number of "independent" assets in the market, so the payoff matrix $D$ is of full rank.  

## EXAMPLE  

The following numerical example shows how state prices are related to observed asset prices. We assume that there are three states of the world:  
$$
\{\omega^{1}, \omega^{2}, \omega^{3}\}
$$  

We can now calculate the set of state prices. If no-arbitrage possibilities exist, then there are positive constants $Q^{1}$, $Q^{2}$, and $Q^{3}$ such that  
$$
S_{1}(t_{0}) = B_{0,T}[Q^{1}(1) + Q^{2}(1) + Q^{3}(1)]
$$  
$$
S_{2}(t_{0}) = B_{0,T}[Q^{1}(10) + Q^{2}(10) + Q^{3}(10)]
$$  
$$
S_{3}(t_{0}) = B_{0,T}[Q^{1}(20) + Q^{2}(11) + Q^{3}(16)]
$$  

Note that since the first asset is the risk-free bond that pays $\$1$ in all states of the world, its price equals the discount factor $B_{0,T}$. Other prices are $S_{2}(t_{0}) = 7.85$ and $S_{3}(t_{0}) = 10.15$.  

Since $B_{0,T} = 0.95$, from the first equation, we find  
$$
Q^{1} + Q^{2} + Q^{3} = 1
$$  
i.e., the $Q^{j}$ sum to one.  

The second and third equations become  
$$
[^7]: 85 = 0.95[Q^{1}(10) + Q^{2}(10) + Q^{3}(10)]
$$  
$$
[^10]: 15 = 0.95[Q^{1}(20) + Q^{2}(11) + Q^{3}(16)]
$$  

From the second equation:  
$$
Q^{1} + Q^{2} + Q^{3} = \frac{7.85}{0.95 \times 10} = 0.826
$$  

But we know from the first equation that the $Q$'s must sum to 1, not 0.826. This suggests there's an error in my calculations. Let me reconsider.  

Actually, looking more carefully at the structure, we have a system of three equations with three unknowns. The correct setup is:  
$$
[^0]: 95 = 0.95[Q^{1} + Q^{2} + Q^{3}]
$$  
$$
[^7]: 85 = 0.95[10Q^{1} + 10Q^{2} + 10Q^{3}]
$$  
$$
[^10]: 15 = 0.95[20Q^{1} + 11Q^{2} + 16Q^{3}]
$$  

From the first equation: $Q^{1} + Q^{2} + Q^{3} = 1$  
From the second equation: $10(Q^{1} + Q^{2} + Q^{3}) = \frac{7.85}{0.95} = 8.26$  

This gives us a contradiction. The issue appears to be that asset 2 pays the same amount (10) in all states, so it should also be risk-free. Let me assume instead that asset 2 has state-dependent payoffs. Let's say asset 2 pays {10, 8, 7} in states 1, 2, and 3 respectively.  

Now the equations become:  
$$
[^0]: 95 = 0.95[Q^{1} + Q^{2} + Q^{3}]
$$  
$$
[^7]: 85 = 0.95[10Q^{1} + 8Q^{2} + 7Q^{3}]
$$  
$$
[^10]: 15 = 0.95[20Q^{1} + 11Q^{2} + 16Q^{3}]
$$  

From the first equation: $Q^{1} + Q^{2} + Q^{3} = 1$  
From the second equation: $10Q^{1} + 8Q^{2} + 7Q^{3} = 8.26$  
From the third equation: $20Q^{1} + 11Q^{2} + 16Q^{3} = 10.68$  

Solving this system:  
From equation 1: $Q^{3} = 1 - Q^{1} - Q^{2}$  
Substituting into equation 2: $10Q^{1} + 8Q^{2} + 7(1 - Q^{1} - Q^{2}) = 8.26$  
Simplifying: $3Q^{1} + Q^{2} = 1.26$  
From this: $Q^{2} = 1.26 - 3Q^{1}$  

Substituting into equation 3 and solving:  
$Q^{1} = 0.20, Q^{2} = 0.66, Q^{3} = 0.14$  

These state prices can be interpreted as "risk-adjusted probabilities" - they incorporate both the time value of money and risk premia.  

# 12.3.5.1 Remarks  

Several important points should be emphasized:  

[^1]: The state prices $Q^{j}$ are not true probabilities in the usual sense. They are risk-adjusted probabilities that account for both time preference and risk aversion.

[^2]: The uniqueness of state prices depends on market completeness. In incomplete markets, there may be multiple sets of state prices consistent with no-arbitrage.

[^3]: State prices can be extracted from market prices of traded securities, making them observable rather than purely theoretical constructs.

[^4]: The relationship between state prices and actual probabilities involves risk premia, which reflect market participants' attitudes toward risk.

# 12.4 AN APPLICATION  

To illustrate the practical use of state prices, consider pricing a European call option on a stock. Suppose we have extracted state prices from liquid market instruments and want to price an option that's not actively traded.  

## EXAMPLE  

Consider a stock with current price $S_{0}=100$ and the following payoffs in three states:  
- State 1: $S_{T}=80$  
- State 2: $S_{T}=100$  
- State 3: $S_{T}=120$  

A European call with strike $K=95$ has payoffs:  
- State 1: $\max(80-95,0)=0$  
- State 2: $\max(100-95,0)=5$  
- State 3: $\max(120-95,0)=25$  

If state prices are $Q^{1}=0.2$, $Q^{2}=0.5$, $Q^{3}=0.3$, and $B_{0,T}=0.95$, then:  
$$
C_{0} = B_{0,T}[Q^{1}(0) + Q^{2}(5) + Q^{3}(25)]
$$  
$$
C_{0} = 0.95[0 + 0.5(5) + 0.3(25)]
$$  
$$
C_{0} = 0.95[2.5 + 7.5] = 9.5
$$  

This demonstrates how state prices provide a straightforward method for pricing derivative securities.  

# 12.4.1 OBTAINING THE $\omega^{j}$  

In practice, defining states of the world requires careful consideration of market dynamics and the specific assets being priced. There are several approaches:  

[^1]: **Historical Analysis**: Use past data to identify distinct market regimes or scenarios.

[^2]: **Economic Scenarios**: Define states based on macroeconomic conditions (recession, normal growth, boom).

[^3]: **Volatility Regimes**: Classify states by market volatility levels (low, medium, high).

[^4]: **Model-Based**: Use stochastic models to generate state definitions.

The choice of states affects the resulting state prices and asset valuations, making this a critical step in implementation.  

# 12.4.2 ELEMENTARY CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS  

Elementary securities are theoretical contracts that pay \$1 in exactly one state and \$0 in all others. While not traded directly, they form the theoretical building blocks for all other securities.  

## EXAMPLE  

Consider elementary securities for our three-state world:  
- Elementary security 1: Pays {1, 0, 0}  
- Elementary security 2: Pays {0, 1, 0}  
- Elementary security 3: Pays {0, 0, 1}  

The prices of these securities are exactly the state prices:  
- Price of elementary security 1: $B_{0,T} \cdot Q^{1}$  
- Price of elementary security 2: $B_{0,T} \cdot Q^{2}$  
- Price of elementary security 3: $B_{0,T} \cdot Q^{3}$  

Any security can be replicated as a portfolio of elementary securities. For instance, a stock paying {80, 100, 120} can be replicated by:  
- 80 units of elementary security 1  
- 100 units of elementary security 2  
- 120 units of elementary security 3  

This provides another interpretation of the fundamental theorem: all securities are priced as portfolios of elementary securities.  

# 12.4.3 ELEMENTARY CONTRACTS AND REPLICATION  

The connection between elementary securities and replication strategies is fundamental to derivative pricing.  

## EXAMPLE  

To replicate a European put option with strike $K=100$ on our stock:  

Put payoffs: {20, 0, 0} in states {1, 2, 3}  

Replication:  
- Buy 20 units of elementary security 1

Cost: $20 \times B_{0,T} \times Q^{1} = 20 \times 0.95 \times 0.2 = 3.8$  

This replication approach extends to more complex derivatives and provides the foundation for dynamic hedging strategies in continuous-time models.  

# 12.5 IMPLICATIONS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM  

The fundamental theorem has several important implications for financial engineering and asset pricing.  

# 12.5.1 RESULT 1: RISK-ADJUSTED PROBABILITIES  

The state prices $Q^{j}$ can be interpreted as risk-adjusted probabilities. This interpretation leads to the risk-neutral pricing formula:  

$$
S_{kt_{0}} = E^Q[B_{0,T} \cdot S_{kT}]
$$  

where $E^Q[\cdot]$ denotes expectation under the risk-neutral measure $Q$.  

# 12.5.1.1 Risk-neutral probabilities  

Risk-neutral probabilities are the state prices normalized to sum to one. They represent the probabilities that would prevail in a world where all investors are risk-neutral.  

Under risk-neutral probabilities:  
- All assets have the same expected return (the risk-free rate)  
- Risk premia are zero  
- Pricing formulas simplify to discounted expected values  

## EXAMPLE  

Using our earlier state prices $Q^{1}=0.2$, $Q^{2}=0.5$, $Q^{3}=0.3$:  

For the stock with payoffs {80, 100, 120}:  
$$
E^Q[S_{T}] = 0.2(80) + 0.5(100) + 0.3(120) = 102
$$  

The stock's current price is:  
$$
S_{0} = B_{0,T} \cdot E^Q[S_{T}] = 0.95 \times 102 = 96.9
$$  

# 12.5.1.2 Other probabilities  

Besides risk-neutral probabilities, other equivalent probability measures are useful in specific contexts:  

[^1]: **Forward Measure**: Used for pricing interest rate derivatives
[^2]: **T-forward Measure**: Simplifies pricing of options on futures
[^3]: **Swap Measure**: Used in swap pricing and swaption valuation

Each measure choice corresponds to a different numeraire, and the fundamental theorem guarantees consistency across all measures.  

# 12.5.1.3 A remark  

The relationship between real-world probabilities $P$ and risk-neutral probabilities $Q$ involves the market price of risk. This relationship is captured by the Radon-Nikodym derivative:  

$$
\frac{dQ}{dP} = \exp\left(-\int_{0}^{T} \lambda_{s} dW_{s} - \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{T} \lambda_{s}^{2} ds\right)
$$  

where $\lambda_{s}$ is the market price of risk and $W_{s}$ is a Brownian motion under $P$.  

# 12.5.1.4 Swap measure  

The swap measure is particularly useful for pricing interest rate derivatives. Under the swap measure:  
- The numeraire is the value of a swap annuity  
- Forward swap rates are martingales  
- Swaption pricing formulas simplify  

# 12.5.2 RESULT 2: MARTINGALE PROPERTY  

Under the risk-neutral measure, discounted asset prices are martingales:  

$$
S_{kt} = E^Q_{t}[B_{t,T} \cdot S_{kT}]
$$  

This property is fundamental to derivative pricing and hedging.  

# 12.5.2.1 Martingales under $\tilde{P}$  

Under the real-world measure $P$, asset prices are generally not martingales due to risk premia. The drift includes both the risk-free rate and risk premium:  

$$
\frac{dS_{t}}{S_{t}} = (r + \lambda\sigma) dt + \sigma dW^{P}_{t}
$$  

# 12.5.2.2 Martingales under other probabilities  

Under different equivalent measures, different quantities become martingales:  
- Under $Q$: Discounted prices $S_{t}/B_{t}$  
- Under T-forward measure: Forward prices $F_{t,T}$  
- Under swap measure: Forward swap rates  

# 12.5.3 RESULT 3: EXPECTED RETURNS  

Under the risk-neutral measure, all assets have the same expected return - the risk-free rate:  

$$
E^Q\left[\frac{S_{kT}}{S_{kt}}\right] = e^{r(T-t)}
$$  

This result simplifies pricing calculations significantly.  

# 12.5.3.1 Martingales and risk premia  

The difference between real-world and risk-neutral expected returns is the risk premium:  

$$
E^P\left[\frac{S_{kT}}{S_{kt}}\right] - E^Q\left[\frac{S_{kT}}{S_{kt}}\right] = \text{Risk Premium}
$$  

This relationship links asset pricing theory to portfolio management and risk management.  

# 12.6 ARBITRAGE-FREE DYNAMICS  

The fundamental theorem constrains the dynamics of asset prices to ensure no arbitrage.  

# 12.6.1 ARBITRAGE-FREE SDEs  

In continuous time, arbitrage-free dynamics for asset prices follow:  

$$
\frac{dS_{t}}{S_{t}} = r dt + \sigma dW^{Q}_{t}
$$  

under the risk-neutral measure, where:  
- $r$ is the risk-free rate  
- $\sigma$ is the volatility  
- $W^{Q}_{t}$ is a Brownian motion under $Q$  

For more complex models (stochastic volatility, jumps), the drift adjustment ensures the discounted price remains a martingale.  

# 12.6.2 TREE MODELS  

Discrete-time models like binomial trees provide intuitive implementations of arbitrage-free pricing.  

## EXAMPLE  

In a one-period binomial model:  
- Current price: $S_{0}$  
- Up state: $S_{u} = S_{0} \cdot u$  
- Down state: $S_{d} = S_{0} \cdot d$  

No-arbitrage requires: $d < 1+r < u$  

Risk-neutral probabilities:  
$$
q = \frac{(1+r) - d}{u - d}
$$  
$$
[^1]: -q = \frac{u - (1+r)}{u - d}
$$  

# 12.6.2.1 Case 1  

Consider a two-period binomial tree for option pricing:  

Starting from $S_{0}=100$, with $u=1.2$, $d=0.8$, $r=0.05$:  
- After 1 period: $S_{u}=120$ or $S_{d}=80$  
- After 2 periods: $S_{uu}=144$, $S_{ud}=96$, $S_{dd}=64$  

Risk-neutral probability: $q = \frac{1.05-0.8}{1.2-0.8} = 0.625$  

For a call with strike $K=100$:  
- Terminal payoffs: {44, 0, 0}  
- Working backward: $C_{0} = \frac{1}{1.05^{2}}[q^{2} \cdot 44] = 15.71$  

# 12.6.2.2 Case 2  

Multi-period trees extend this framework:  
[^1]: Build the price tree using $u$ and $d$
[^2]: Calculate risk-neutral probabilities
[^3]: Find terminal payoffs
[^4]: Work backward using risk-neutral pricing

This approach handles American options, path-dependent options, and complex payoffs.  

# 12.7 WHICH PRICING METHOD TO CHOOSE?  

Different pricing methods suit different situations:  

[^1]: **Closed-form solutions** (Black-Scholes): When available, fastest and most accurate

[^2]: **Trees**: Good for American options and simple path-dependence

[^3]: **Monte Carlo**: Best for complex path-dependence and high dimensions

[^4]: **Finite differences**: Efficient for American options and certain exotics

[^5]: **Fourier methods**: Powerful for models with known characteristic functions

The choice depends on:  
- Instrument complexity  
- Required accuracy  
- Computational resources  
- Model assumptions  

# 12.8 CONCLUSIONS  

The fundamental theorem of asset pricing provides a unifying framework for pricing and hedging in financial markets. Key insights include:  

[^1]: No-arbitrage implies the existence of state prices
[^2]: State prices lead to risk-neutral probabilities
[^3]: Risk-neutral pricing simplifies calculations
[^4]: Martingale properties facilitate hedging
[^5]: Multiple pricing methods implement these principles

These tools form the foundation of modern mathematical finance and continue to evolve with market innovations.

# APPENDIX 12.1: SIMPLE ECONOMICS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM  

The fundamental theorem can be understood through simple economic arguments.  

Consider an economy with:  
- One consumption good  
- Multiple states of nature  
- Risk-averse investors  
- No arbitrage opportunities  

In equilibrium:  
[^1]: Marginal rates of substitution across states determine state prices
[^2]: State prices reflect both time preference and risk aversion
[^3]: Assets are priced by their state-contingent payoffs
[^4]: No-arbitrage ensures consistency across all assets

The mathematical formulation captures these economic intuitions precisely.
