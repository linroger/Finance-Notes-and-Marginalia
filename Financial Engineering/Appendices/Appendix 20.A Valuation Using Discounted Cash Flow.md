# Appendix 20. A Valuation Using Discounted Cash Flow

For the special case where the stock follows [geometric Brownian motion](../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md),  and where the claim has the payoff $S^{u}$ ,  we can also use [discounted cash flow](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lehman%20Brothers%20Option%20Adjusted%20Spread.md) (DCF) to value the claim. In general,  there is no reason to use DCF when we can perform risk-neutral valuation,  bu it is instructive to see how DCF works in the case where a claim pays $S^{a}$ .We can value the claim by discounting the expected payoff under the physical measure at an appropriate [discount rate](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/PSET%207-%20Kohler.md). To do this we must compute the expected value of the claim and discount the expected payoff appropriately We know that the stock has a Sharpe ratio of $(\alpha-r)/\sigma$ . Equation (20.34) tells us that $S^{u}$ follows [geometric Brownian motion](../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md) with drift $a (\alpha-\delta)+0.5 a (a-1)\sigma^{2}$ and diffusion term $a_0 dZ$ gives us the process followed by $S^{a}$ . The requirement for equal Sharpe ratios tells that the [expected return](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) for a claim paying $S^{a},       \alpha_{a}$ must satisfy$$\frac{\alpha_a-r}{a\sigma}=\frac{\alpha-r}{\sigma}$$
This implies that $\alpha_{a}$ is$$\alpha_{a}=a (\alpha-r)+r$$
For the moment. Set $\delta=0.$ It is obvious that in general$$a (\alpha-r)+r\neq a\alpha+0.5 a (a-1)\sigma^{2}$$
The economic issue is that if $\alpha$ is the equilibrium return for the stock-that is,  it is the return for which investors are willing to hold the stock —then $a\alpha+0.5 a (a-1)\sigma^{2}$ is not generally the return for which investors are willing to hold a claim with the value $S^{u}$ . This is a consequence of Jensen’s inequality: Raising the [stock price](../Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Black–Scholes%20Model.md) to a power requires a particular change in the [expected return](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md),  which is not the same as the return generated by raising the price to a power. To make investors willing to hold a claim paying $S^{u}$ at time 7 ,  the clain must sell at a premium or discount prior to time $I$ .We have already valued the claim in Proposition 20.3,  but we will value the claim a second time,  illustrating the application of DCF valuation in this context We know that the expected value of $S (T)^a$ is$$\mathrm{E}_{0}\left[S (T)^{a}\right]=S (0)^{a}e^{[a (\alpha-\delta)+\frac{1}{2}a (a-1)\sigma^{2}]T}$$
The [expected return](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) on this claim,  which is also the appropriate [discount rate](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/PSET%207-%20Kohler.md),  is given by expression (20.46). The price at time 0 of a claim paying $S (T)^{a}$ at time 1 is therefore the discounted expected payoff:$$\begin{aligned}
F_{0,       T}^{P}(S^{a})& =e^{-[r+a (\alpha-r)]T}\mathrm{E}(S (T)^{a})  \\
&=e^{-[r+a (\alpha-r)]T}S (0)^{a}e^{[a (\alpha-\delta)+\frac{1}{2}a (a-1)\sigma^{2}]T} \\
&=S (0)^{a}e^{-rT}e^{[a (r-\delta)+\frac{1}{2}a (a-1)\sigma^{2}]T}
\end{aligned}$$
Note that the risk premium on the stock,       $\alpha-r$ drops out of the derivation. This illustrates that DCF yields the same answer as [risk-neutral pricing](../Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md). The use of a constant [discount rate](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/PSET%207-%20Kohler.md) works in this case because the payoff to the claim is relatively simple. In many cases computing a price using DCF will be more difficult than computing the price using [risk neutral](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%207-Exotic%20Options%20And%20Derivative%20Pricing%20By%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation.md) valuation.
