# Index Futures  

# Aims  

• To provide details of contract speci!cation, [settlement procedures](.md) and quotes for [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) contracts.   
• To demonstrate [index arbitrage](.md) and [program trading](.md) using [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md).   
• To price a [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) contract, when stocks which make up the cash market index (e.g. S&P 500), pay discrete dividends.   
• To determine the number of [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) to use when [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) various cash market positions (e.g. a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks or holding barrels of oil).   
• To outline the risks which remain, after [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) with index [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md).   
• To demonstrate ‘[tailing the hedge](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Pricing%20and%20Hedging%20Implications%20of%20Daily%20Sett.md)’.  

[Stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) (SIF) are contracts whose price depends on an underlying [stock market](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) index such as the S&P 500, FTSE 100 or Nikkei 225 indices. Such [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) are widely used in [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md), speculation, and [index arbitrage](.md).  

In a well-diversi!ed [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks, speci!c (idiosyncratic) risk of individual stocks has been largely eliminated and only ‘market’ (‘systematic’ or ‘non-diversi!able’) risk remains. [Stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) can be used to eliminate this ‘[market risk](.md)’ of the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks. In ‘normal times’ a fund manager might be quite happy to hold a diversi!ed [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks even though they are risky. But if a fund manager believes the market will become increasingly volatile over the next 3 months (i.e. could rise or fall substantially) and she wished to remove this uncertainty, she could sell [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) to eliminate the [market risk](.md). At the end of the 3-month period, she would have neither gained nor lost.1 If she believes the [stock market](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) has then returned to a ‘normal level of volatility’, she would close out her [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position and her stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) would again be subject to [market risk](.md).  

Alternatively, suppose you plan to invest cash that you will receive in 3 months’ time in a diversi!ed [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks but you are worried that the [stock market](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) will rise over the next 3 months. By buying [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) today you can !x the efective future purchase price of the stocks.  

Also, speculation on a bear or bull market is easier to achieve with [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) rather than incurring the cost of buying or selling a large number of stocks that make up your prospective speculative stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). Finally, if the quoted [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) price is not equal to the ‘correct’ (no [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md)) [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) then you can make a (near) risk-free [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) pro!t by simultaneously trading in the spot and [futures markets](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md). We elaborate on these ideas in this chapter and consider further strategies in later chapters.  

# 5.1 STOCK INDEX FUTURES (SIF)  

[Stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) contracts are written on aggregate [stock market](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) indices and are settled in cash. In the US index [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) traded on the CME (Chicago) include those on the S&P 500, the Mini-S&P 500, the Russel 1000 (large cap index), the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Nikkei 225 (Japanese index), as well as several other indices. Trading volume is highest in the S&P 500 [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract and taking all of these contracts together, the dollar volume of the underlying stocks traded in these index [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) exceeds the dollar volume on the [stock market](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) itself.  

On LIFFE2 (pronounced ‘life’), [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) are available on various UK stock indices including the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 indices, on European indices such as the FTSE Eurotop 100 and FTSE Eurotop 300 (including and excluding the UK), and several others. The reason for so many diferent index [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) is so that fund managers can efectively hedge their existing equity portfolios, using a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract which has an underlying [stock index](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) that most closely matches the composition of their own cash market stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). Details of some of these contracts are given in Table 5.1.  

# 5.1.1 Contract Multiple  

All [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) are settled in cash (with [settlement procedures](.md) difering between the diferent contracts) and nearly all contracts are closed out prior to their maturity date. [Cash settlement](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Swaptions.md) is based on the value of an index point $\$7$ (or the ‘contract multiple’ ), which is set by the exchange (for the S&P 500, $z=\$250$ ). For the S&P 500 index [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract, the smallest price change, a tick, is 0.1 index points, representing a $\$25$ change in value of one futures contract. Hence, a 1-point change in the S&P 500 futures index implies a change in the dollar value of one futures contract of $\$250$ . If the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) index on the S&P 500 is currently $F_{0}=2000$ , then:

# 5.1.2 Stock Indices  

The S&P 500 and FTSE 100 stock indices are value (market capitalisation) weighted indices. The S&P 500 and FTSE 100 indices ignore [dividend payments](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) and therefore do not truly refect the ‘total [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md)’ from the constituent shares (which include [dividend payments](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md)). Often a [stock index](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) will have both a ‘price version’ and a ‘total return’ version.  

# 5.1.3 Newspaper Quotes  

Newspaper quotes for diferent [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) contracts are very similar. An illustrative example of [price quotes](../Part%20III%20-%20Fixed%20Income%20Futures%20Contracts/Chapter%2011%20-%20Interest%20Rate%20Futures.md) (on 27 July) for [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) on the S&P 500 (traded on CME) with diferent maturities are given in Table 5.2.  

TABLE 5.2 Quotes, index [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) (27 July)

The settlement price (‘Settle’) is an average of [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) prices for trades at the end of the trading day – the settlement price is used in ‘marking-to-market’ and establishing margin payments. ‘Open interest’ is the number of contracts held (long or short) and is highest for the nearby September index [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract and tails of rapidly for longer maturity contracts. Note that for S&P 500 [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md), the longer maturity contracts have higher quoted settlement prices today, than the nearby maturing contracts (see the ‘Settle’ column, Table 5.2). There are also index [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) available on many other stock indices (e.g. on US ‘high tech’ stocks in the NASDAQ-100 (CME); the CAC-40 French [stock index](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) (traded in Paris on the MATIF exchange), and the DAX-30 German index (traded on the EUREX exchange in Frankfurt).  

# 5.2 INDEX ARBITRAGE  

In Chapter 3 we used ‘[cash-and-carry arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Dollar%20Rolls.md)’ to derive the correct (fair, no-[arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md)) [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) on a stock, which also applies to the [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) on a [stock index](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md):  
$$
\begin{array}{l}{F=S[1+(r_{s}-\delta_{s})T]\quad\mathrm{(using~simple~rates)}}\\ {F=S(1+r-\delta)^{T}\quad\mathrm{(using~discrete~compound~rates)}}\\ {F=S e^{(r_{c}-\delta_{c})T}\quad\mathrm{(using~continuouslycompounded~rates)}}\end{array}
$$  

where  
$\mathrm{S}=\mathrm{S}\&\mathrm{P}\ 500$ [stock index](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) (quoted on the NYSE)   $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{S}\&\mathrm{P}\ 500$ [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) index (quoted in Chicago)   ${\boldsymbol{\mathrm{T}}}=$ [time to maturity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract, number of years (or fraction of a year)   $\textbf{r}=$ (domestic) [risk-free interest rate](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) (proportionate, p.a.)   $\delta=$ dividend yield (proportionate, p.a)  

If the current [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md) $r$ is greater than the dividend yield (i.e. $r>\delta\bar{}$ ) then the current quoted [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) (in Chicago) will be above the current [stock price](../Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Black–Scholes%20Model.md) (on the NYSE), that is $F>S$ , and vice versa. In applying the ‘cost-of-carry’ model we have to make the following assumptions:  

• Investors can purchase or short-sell stocks, to ‘replicate’ the performance of all the stocks in the [stock index](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md).   
• Actual discrete dividends paid out from stocks in the S&P 500 index (over the life of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)) can be approximated by a constant (value weighted) dividend yield, $\delta$ , or actual discrete [dividend payments](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) from the stocks in the index are known with certainty (see   
below).  

# 5.2.1 Program Trading  

If the quoted [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) is not given by the equalities in (5.1), then [index arbitrage](.md) enables (almost) risk-free pro!ts to be made. In large !nancial institutions real time data on $r,\delta,T,S$ and the quoted [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) $F_{q}$ are fed into computers and when $F_{q}\neq F$ in Equation (5.1), an [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) strategy is applied.  

Borrowing or lending cash at $r$ to undertake the [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) transaction is usually done via the repo market. Suppose an arbitrageur is faced with the following data:  
$$
\delta_{c}=0.03\:(3\%\:\mathrm{p.a.)}
$$  
$$
\begin{array}{l}{r_{c}=0.10\ (10\%\ \mathrm{p.a.})}\\ {T=1/3\ \mathrm{year}\ (\mathrm{i.e.}\ 4\ \mathrm{months})}\end{array}
$$  

‘Fair’ [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md):  
$$

# 5.2.2 Discrete Dividend Payments  

In practice, [dividend payments](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) are clustered around certain months (particularly February and March in the US) so that the assumption of a constant dividend yield is an approximation.  

![](683dc6fac351482e3624d3b8b2669dcd0243ed38b2c2a0591e8443029f0fb15a.jpg)  
FIGURE 5.1 [Futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md): dividend paying stock  

However, the [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) relationship is similar when dividends are paid in discrete amounts. Assume there are $N\mathrm{.}$ -[dividend payments](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) of $D_{j}$ , each of which is paid $t_{j}$ years (or fraction of a year) from today $t=0$ (Figure 5.1).  

All of the individual discrete [dividend payments](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) at time $t=0$ are worth:  
$$
P V(D)=\sum_{j=1}^{N}D_{j}\ e^{-r_{c}t_{j}}
$$  

Each dividend payment $D_{j}$ payable $t_{j}$ years from today is discounted, which puts all [dividend payments](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) at $t=0$ , the same point in time as the [stock price](../Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Black–Scholes%20Model.md) $S_{0}$ . Hence the net cost of a [replication portfolio](../Part%20V%20-%20Options%20Pricing/Chapter%2022%20-%20BOPM:%20Implementation.md) at $t=0$ is $S_{0}-P V(D)$ , which accrues to $[S_{0}-P V(D)]e^{r_{c}T}$ at $T$ the maturity of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), so today’s [no-arbitrage futures price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Part%20II-Basis%20Trading%20and%20the%20Implied%20Repo%20Rate.md) is:  
$$
F_{0}=[S_{0}-P V(D)]e^{r_{c}T}
$$  

Above we assumed $r_{c}$ is constant for all maturities (i.e. yield curve is fat over $t=0$ to $T)-$ but if not, this is easily taken care of by using $r_{c,j}$ in place of $r_{c}$ .  

There is [basis risk](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md) in the [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) strategy for several reasons. First, traders might only buy (or sell) a subset of the 500 stocks which make up the S&P 500 index. Hence the change in value of the arbitrageur’s [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks might not exactly match the change in value of the S&P 500 [stock index](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md). Second, there are the arbitrageur’s transactions costs to consider and any uncertainty in the timing of [dividend payments](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) over the life of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract. Third, it might not be possible to execute trades in the index [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract and all the stocks (in the index) at exactly the same time – in the meantime the prices of some of the underlying stocks might change.  

Because [index arbitrage](.md) opportunities are calculated using computerised real-time data, it is also known as [program trading](.md) and is the subject of some controversy when the markets move rapidly (see Finance Blog 5.1).  

Academic studies suggest that [index arbitrage](.md) pro!ts are di\$cult to exploit but tend to occur more often in those contracts with a longer [time to maturity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md). This may be because these are the less liquid contracts where the ‘fair price’ and the quoted [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) might diverge because traders cannot obtain credit lines for these longer periods and therefore cannot instigate the [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) transaction.  

Over the past few years, replicating the movement in a [stock market](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) index has been made much simpler by the [introduction](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Introduction.md) of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These are ‘funds’ that closely track changes in a speci!c index and can be bought and sold (at all times of the day) in the ‘cash market’, usually on electronic platforms at low transactions costs. This means that it is nearly always the case that [index arbitrage](.md) ensures that the index [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) is given by $F_{0}=[S_{0}-P V(D)]e^{r_{c}T}$ .  

# Finance Blog 5.1 Program Trading and the 1987 Crash  

There was much discussion, particularly after the 1987 crash, of whether [program trading](.md) caused increased volatility in the [stock market](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md). If program traders are all selling stock via on-the-close orders on the maturity date of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract then this may increase volatility due to order imbalances. Other traders may also be trading [stock index](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) options, and options on [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md). If these options contracts expire at the same time as the [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md), then volatility in the cash market for stocks could be large – such periods are known as the triple witching hour.  

Stoll and Whaley (1986) !nd that the volatility on the [stock market](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) is greater on [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) maturity dates (by a factor of 3) than on other days – particularly in the last hour of trading. The Brady Commission (1988) also felt that [program trading](.md) exacerbated problems in the 1987 crash – but it is not clear that [program trading](.md) results in major problems in more normal periods. The policy suggestions at the time included imposing higher margin on [futures trading](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Mechanics.md) and more use of circuit breakers where the market is closed for ‘cooling of’ periods. Also, to some extent this problem has recently been overshadowed by the possibility that very high frequency trading using automated computer trades is causing excess volatility in the [stock market](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md).

# 5.3 HEDGING  

A well-diversi!ed stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) dramatically reduces ‘speci!c (idiosyncratic) risk’, while [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) contracts allow investors to hedge against changes in (overall stock) ‘[market risk](.md)’ which is usually assumed to be adequately measured by some broad [stock market](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) index, which we take to be the S&P 500 index.  

[Hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) relies on the positive correlation between spot and [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) prices. This implies that if you hold a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks (‘long in the cash market’), then [shorting](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Short%20Selling.md) [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) contracts ‘creates’ a negative correlation – what you lose on your cash market stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), you hope to gain on your index [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position. If a hedged [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) entirely eliminates [market risk](.md) then we might expect it to earn the [risk-free rate of return](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments.md).  

Suppose that on 28 December Ms Midas holds a $\$100$ diversi!ed portfolio of US stocks which exactly mirrors the composition of the S&P 500 index, so the beta of her stock portfolio $\beta_{p}=1$ . She feels the [stock market](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) is likely to be more volatile (than normal) over the next 3 months. This presents both opportunities for large price rises and large price falls. But let us assume that Ms Midas is very worried about a general fall in the [stock market](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) over the next 3 months, between 28 December and 28 March. This may be because she has already achieved the target return on her [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and is worried that her past gains are likely to be eroded over the next 3 months – which is the end of the period over which her performance (and bonus) will be evaluated by her superiors.  

She can use [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) to eliminate this [market risk](.md) (and earn the [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md) of interest) over the 3-month period. Of course, she could also earn the [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md) by selling all her stocks and holding T-bills. However, this would involve high transactions costs, as she would have to sell and then buy-back the stocks 3 months later. Continuing to hold the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks and [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) using [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) is far cheaper.  

To hedge over 3 months she requires a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract which has at least 3 months to maturity. Suppose on 28 December Ms Midas decides to use the June-[futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) (which has a maturity date towards the end of June). [Stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) (on the S&P 500) are cash settled with each index point (‘tick’) on the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is assigned a value of $\$250$ .  

Ms Midas can hedge on 28 December by selling ([shorting](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Short%20Selling.md)) the June-index [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) (on the S&P 500). For the moment, assume a perfect correlation between the underlying market index S and the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) index $\mathrm{~F~}$ (i.e. correlation coe\$cient of $+1$ ) and that both indices move by the same amount. If the S&P 500 index on the NYSE on 28 December is $S_{0}=2\mathrm{,000}$ and the market falls by $10\%$ over the next 3 months, the S&P index will fall to 1,800 (i.e. by 200 points). Ms Midas’s stock portfolio will fall in value by $\S1\mathrm{m}(=\S10\mathrm{m}\times10\%)$ . If we assume $F$ and $s$ move by the same absolute amount then the change in $F=200$ points and the change in value of one futures contract is $\$50,000($ . Hence the number of [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) to hedge your stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is:  
$$
N_{F}=\frac{C h a n g e~i n~\nu a l u e~o f s p o t~p o r t f o l i o}{C h a n g e~i n~\nu a l u e~o f~o n e~f u t u r e s~c o n t r a c t}=\frac{\mathfrak{G}1\mathrm{m}}{\mathfrak{G}50,000}=20~\mathrm{contracts}
$$  

So Ms Midas would hedge by [shorting](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Short%20Selling.md) 20 contracts on 28 December. The outcome of the hedged position on 28 March is therefore:  
$$
=\mathfrak{s}10\mathrm{m}\left(10\%\right)=\mathfrak{s}1\mathrm{m}
$$  
$$
=200\times\S250\times20=\Phi1\mathrm{m}
$$  

The reader can verify that a similar hedged outcome would ensue if stock prices rise by $10\%$ . Here, the capital gain on the stocks would be ofset by the loss on the short [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position – after $F$ increases Ms Midas has to buy back the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) at a higher price (i.e. at a loss). In this case, with hindsight it would have been better not to have hedged – but ‘hindsight’ is not ‘available’ on 28 December. In any case the whole idea of a hedge is to remove price risk and in doing so, you also forego any favourable outcomes if stock prices rise. ‘You can’t have your cake and eat it’ – you can be a hedger or a speculator in any given deal, but not both.  

If the beta of Ms Midas’s [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks is $\beta_{p}=1.5$ and the market falls by $10\%$ , the return on her [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) falls by $15\%$ $(=R_{p}=\beta_{p}R_{m})$ . Hence, she needs more [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) for an efective hedge. She would in fact need to short 30 [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md). This is because the change in the dollar value of her stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is now expected to be $\$100$ , so $N_{F}=(1.5\mathrm{m}/50,000)=30$ .  

The above example looks a bit too good to be true – a perfect hedge. Yes, this is too optimistic! The reason for this is that we assumed the absolute change in the two indices, $F$ and $s$ are exactly the same. In practice this is not the case. First, $F$ and $s$ do not move exactly together, ‘index point-for-index point’ – they do so only approximately. Second, because [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) might change over the life of the hedge, this slightly afects the relationship between changes in $F$ and $s$ – recall that $F=S(1+r T)$ – this is [basis risk](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md). Third, because the beta of your [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks is estimated with error, when the market moves by $10\%$ the value of your stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) might not move by exactly $15\%$ – this is probably the biggest source of error in the hedge.  

Let’s return to the case where $\beta_{p}=1$ and consider a more realistic scenario where there would be some [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) error. On 28 December the S&P 500 index $S_{0}=2\mathrm{,000}$ and the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) index price $F_{0}=2\mathrm{,040}$ . Over the next 3 months the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) manager’s worst fears are met and the S&P 500 index falls by $10\%$ (200 index points) to $S_{1}=1\small{,}800$ , so Ms Midas’s stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) falls in value by $\$10$ . On 28 March, the June-futures index falls to $F_{1}=1{,}818$ – a fall of 222 index points4 – the [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) are closed out (i.e. buy-back) and the outcome of the hedged position on 28 March is:  

Loss $\$100$ stock portfolio $(10\%)={\mathfrak{S}}1\mathrm{m}$  
$$
\tan\beta=222\times\oint250\times20\mathrm{contracts}=\oint1.11\mathrm{m}
$$  

Hence the hedge position has produced a small pro!t of $\$120,000$ $1.1\%$ of the portfolio value of $\$100$ ). But most importantly, it has averted a possible large loss of $\$10$ had the  

position remained unhedged. In practice hedge positions result in small pro!ts or losses but these average out to zero5 for a large number of hedges, implemented over time.  

# 5.3.1 Minimum Variance Hedge Ratio  

Instead of working out the number of [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) you need when you consider a particular fall (e.g. $10\%$ ) in the market index, perhaps the ‘best’ formula to use (known as the minimum variance [hedge ratio](../Part%20VI%20-%20The%20Greeks/Chapter%2027%20-%20Delta%20Hedging.md)) is to calculate the number of [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) using:  
$$
\begin{array}{c}{{N_{F}=-\left(\frac{\displaystyle\S V a l u e\ o f c a s h\ m a r k e t p o s i t i o n}{\displaystyle\S V a l u e\ o f o n e f u t u r e s\ c o n t r a c t}\right)\beta_{p}}}\\ {{=-\displaystyle\frac{V_{p}}{V_{F}}\beta_{p}=-\frac{\displaystyle\S10\mathrm{m}}{\displaystyle(\S250)(2,040)}=-19.6(=-20\ c o n t r a c t s)}}\end{array}
$$  

where, $\beta_{p}=1,F_{0}=2,040$ and $V_{F}=(\mathbb{\S}250F_{0})=\mathbb{\S}510,000$ . $V_{F}$ is the ‘dollar value of one [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract’ and is also sometimes referred to as the ‘[invoice price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%201/Accrued%20Interest.md)’ or ‘contract price’ of the [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md). But note that it is a purely notional amount, since this money is not paid at inception of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract (only a small margin payment is made).  

What is important in [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) is that the change in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) index is (approximately) matched by the change in the (underlying) S&P 500 [stock index](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md). The (arbitrary) use of $\$250$ simply converts a 1 point change in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) index to a dollar amount.6  

The negative sign means Ms Midas needs to short 20 contracts. The above formula gives an answer very close to our ‘simple’ method described above. But it also has the advantage that you can just ‘plug in’ the known value for the (index) [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), $F_{0}=2\mathrm{,040}$ , currently quoted in Chicago (or on your trading screen). A slight variant to Equation (5.7) is to use the dollar value of the S&P 500 [stock index](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) $(=\$250\times S_{0})$ in the denominator, where $S_{0}$ is the current level of the S&P 500 [stock index](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md), then:  
$$
N_{F}=-\frac{V_{p}}{(\S250)S_{0}}\beta_{p}=-\frac{\S10\mathrm{m}}{(\S250)(2,000)}=-20\mathrm{contracts}
$$  

Because $F_{0}$ and $S_{0}$ do not difer greatly, the above two formulas usually give similar answers for $N_{F}$ . Notice that in the above we used [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) contracts to hedge a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks – and this is usually the case in practice. But you might also wish to hedge your holdings of individual stocks (e.g. Microsoft). Here you have an alternative which is to use a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract on Microsoft stock, itself. The above formula still applies but of course here the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract on Microsoft has a beta of unity (with respect to Microsoft’s stock return). You can also use the above formulas (with slight modi!cations) to set up a hedge position for oil, wheat, foreign exchange, etc. (see Appendix 5).  

# EXAMPLE 5.1  

# Hedging, Key Decisions  

• If you are long (i.e. own) the spot asset (e.g. [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks, oil) then to hedge you sell (short) [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contacts, today.   
• If you are planning to purchase the [underlying asset](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) (e.g. [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks, oil) in the future (i.e. you are short in the cash market) then to hedge you purchase (go long) [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md), today.   
• [Hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) works because the actions of arbitrageurs ensures that $F$ and $s$ move together, almost dollar-for-dollar. Hence a [long position](Chapter%204%20-%20Futures:%20Hedging%20and%20Speculation.md) in the spot asset (e.g. stocks) and a short position in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract creates a (near perfect) negative correlation between the spot and [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) prices – so the net change in the value of the hedged position is (close to) zero.   
• Note that any losses on your (long or short) [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position may involve additional [margin calls](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md). Hence a hedger must have lines of credit or other collateral available to meet possible [margin calls](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md).  

# 5.3.2 Hedging in Practice  

Let us now consider a slightly more complex [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) example using SIF, where we explicitly calculate [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) prices, use the CAPM equation to work out the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) on the stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and where the stocks in the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) earn dividends. It is 28 December and Ms Midas holds a $\$100$ [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks and she wishes to hedge over the next 3 months (to 28 March). She uses the June-[futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) index to hedge.  

# 28 December, Ms Midas Portfolio (Hedge period $\mathbf{\lambda}=3$ months)  

[Portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) value $V_{p}=\mathfrak{F}10\mathrm{m}$ $\beta_{p}=1.5$ [Stock index](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) $S_{0}=2\mathrm{,000}$ index points $r=4\%$ continuously compounded  

# 28 December: Stock Index Futures  

Maturity of June-[forward contract](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) $=6$ months (i.e. $T_{0}=1/2$ year)  

Dividend yield on market index $\delta=6\%$ (continuously compounded)  
$$
\begin{array}{l}{F_{0}=S_{0}e^{(r-\delta)T_{0}}=2000e^{-0.02/2}=1980}\\ {V_{F}=(\S250F_{0})=\S495\mathrm{,000}}\end{array}
$$  
$$
N_{F}=-{\frac{V_{p}}{V_{F}}}\beta_{p}=-{\frac{\mathfrak{H}10\mathrm{m}}{\mathfrak{H}495,000}}(1.5)\ {\mathrm{(i.e.~short~}}30\ \mathrm{contracts)}
$$  

# 28 March (3 months later)  

Assume the S&P 500 has fallen by $10\%$ to $S_{1}=1\small{,}800$ and Ms Midas closes out her June-[futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md), which now have 3 months to maturity $\langle T_{1}=1/4$ year :  
$$
F_{1}=S_{1}e^{(r-\delta)T_{1}}=1800e^{-0.02/4}=1,791(F_{0}-F_{1})=189\mathrm{p}
$$  

The percentage return on the market [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) (S&P 500) $\boldsymbol{R_{m}}$ is the capital loss plus the dividend yield (over 3 months):  
$$
\begin{array}{l}{{R_{m}=[(S_{1}-S_{0})/S_{0}]+(\delta/4)}}\\ {{\ \qquad=((1,800-2,000)/2,000)+0.015=-0.085(8.5\%)}}\end{array}
$$  

The [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) on your stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) over 3 months (using the CAPM)7:  
$$
R_{p}=r+\beta_{p}(R_{m}-r)=1\%+1.5(-8.5\%-1\%)=-13.25\%
$$  

Expected value of the stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) after 3 month $\mathbf{\beta}_{\mathrm{3}}=\S10\mathbf{m}\left(1-0.1325\right)=\S8.675\mathbf{m}$  
$$
={\S}8.675\mathrm{{m}}+{\S}1.4175{\mathrm{m}}={\S}10.0925{\mathrm{m}}
$$  

Percentage change in hedged position (over 3 months $)=(\S10.0925\mathrm{m}/\S10\mathrm{m}-1)=0.925\%.$  

The hedged [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) has gained $\$92,500$ $(0.925\%$ of $\$100$ ) in value. Had Ms Midas not hedged she would have lost about $13.25\%$ on her stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).  

The risks in the hedge are:  

• beta of the stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) may be estimated incorrectly or it may change over the hedge period.   
• The stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is not well diversi!ed so that some speci!c risk is present – hence the return on the stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) will not be correctly measured by its beta and the market   
return.8   
• the [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md) and the dividend yield – the sources of [basis risk](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md) – may change over the hedge period (which will alter the correlation between $F$ and $S$ ).  

The !rst point is perhaps the most serious and may arise if beta is really time varying but the regression analysis assumes a constant value for beta, estimated using a long data period. The variability in beta can be analysed using recursive regressions – that is, to re-estimate beta as you add more data or you can simply estimate beta over diferent sample periods, to see how variable its empirical value appears to be. There are also methods for [forecasting](../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md) time varying parameters like beta (e.g. using the Kalman !lter). Alternatively, note that a time varying beta can also be directly calculated by using direct estimates of variances and covariances:  
$$
\beta_{p}=\frac{\sigma_{R_{p},R_{m}}}{\sigma_{R_{m}}^{2}}
$$  

The modelling of time varying variances and covariances using ARCH and GARCH models (see Cuthbertson and Nitzsche 2004, 2008) has been rather successful (especially with ‘high frequency’, daily data) and these models can also be used to forecast $\beta_{p}$ over the hedge period using (5.13). There is some evidence that this may improve the hedge outcome compared with using a !xed value for $\beta_{p}$ (see, for example, Baillie and Myers 1991). Also note that the [hedge ratio](../Part%20VI%20-%20The%20Greeks/Chapter%2027%20-%20Delta%20Hedging.md) given by Equation (5.7) implies that as stock prices change, we should re-calculate $V_{p}$ and hence $N_{F}$ periodically. The return on a stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is:  
$$
R_{p}=\alpha_{p}+\beta_{p}R_{m}+\varepsilon_{p}
$$  

The SIF hedge removes the [market risk](.md) $\beta_{p}R_{m}$ , (see Chapter 6) so one source of the [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) error is speci!c risk $\varepsilon_{p}$ . The dollar [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) error $d V$ and the variance of the [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) error are:  
$$
\begin{array}{c}{d V=V_{p}\varepsilon_{p}}\\ {\sigma_{d V}^{2}=V_{p}^{2}\sigma_{\varepsilon_{p}}^{2}}\end{array}
$$  

It is shown (see Chapter 6) that the variance of the (dollar) [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) error can also be expressed as:  
$$
\sigma_{d V}^{2}=V_{p}^{2}\sigma_{R_{p}}^{2}(1-R s q)
$$  

where is the ‘R-squared’ from the [OLS regression](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/BUS%2035130%20SPRING%202024%20SOLUTION%20TO%20HOMEWORK%201.md) (5.14). Equation (5.15c) can be used to calculate the expected error in the hedge.  

# EXAMPLE 5.2  

# Hedging Error – Stock Portfolio  

BigCapital, a mutual fund, has decided to hedge its $\$100,000$ stock portfolio using SIF over the next month and wants to measure the potential hedging error. The OLS regression of the portfolio monthly return on the market return, has $R s q=0.8$ and $\beta_{p}=1.4$ . The monthly  

(continued)  

# (continued)  

standard deviation of the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) return is $\sigma_{R_{p}}=10\%$ .

$$

$$  

The monthly (dollar) [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) error is therefore $\sigma_{d V}=\sqrt{20\mathrm{m}}=\S4{,}472$ ( $4.5\%$ of the initial value of the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of $\$100,000$ ). Over shorter horizons the dollar hedging error will be smaller. For example, the hedging error over 1 week uses the weekly standard deviations in (5.15c), where approximately, $\sigma_{d V,w e e k}^{2}=\sigma_{d V,m o n t h}^{2}/4$ .  

# 5.4 TAILING THE HEDGE  

There is one other practical issue we should deal with, namely adjusting the hedge to take account of interest paid or received on the margin account. This is called ‘[tailing the hedge](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Pricing%20and%20Hedging%20Implications%20of%20Daily%20Sett.md)’. Suppose you hedge with a short [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position. If the [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) rises, your short position will make losses, and you may have to make additional margin payments which will increase the overall cost of your hedge. You could ofset this increased cost, if you also held some additional long [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) positions which would increase in value, when [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) prices increase. Hence, if you are initially short (long) $N_{F}$ [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), then [tailing the hedge](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Pricing%20and%20Hedging%20Implications%20of%20Daily%20Sett.md) will involve going long (short) some additional [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md). The ‘tail’ is always an opposite position to the initial [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position (of $N_{F}$ [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)). One method of calculating this tail adjustment is:  
$$
N_{t a i l}=-N_{F}r T
$$  

where $N_{t a i l}$ is the number of contracts to tail the hedge, $N_{F}=$ the initial number of [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) (see Equation (5.7)), $r=8\%$ is the risk-free lending or borrowing rate on [variation margin](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Repurchase%20Agreements.md) payments (any surplus over the maintenance margin is assumed to remain in the margin account), $T=$ [time to maturity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). Suppose initially using Equation (5.7) you require $N_{F}=-100$ (short) [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) on the S&P 500 and the maturity of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) is $T=90/360.$ . If the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) index increases by one point, then the short-[futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position will lose value:  

Increased variation margi $\mathrm{1=(+1\point)\times(100\contracts)\times\S250=\S25,000}$ Loss of interest margin $)=\S25,000\times(0.08)\times(90/360)=\S500$ $N_{t a i l}=-N_{F}r T=-(-100)\times0.08\times90/360=+2$ Gain [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) ‘tail $\mathbf{\Sigma}^{\prime}=(+1\mathrm{point})\times(2\mathrm{contracts})\times\S250=\S500$  

Hence, with ‘the tail’ in place, the additional interest cost of the [variation margin](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Repurchase%20Agreements.md) is ofset by [tailing the hedge](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Pricing%20and%20Hedging%20Implications%20of%20Daily%20Sett.md). In practice, $r$ will vary over the life of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) and hence [tailing the hedge](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Pricing%20and%20Hedging%20Implications%20of%20Daily%20Sett.md) will not produce the perfect result given above. Of course, given the initial $N_{f}=-100$ contracts and $N_{t a i l}=+2$ contracts, then the actual initial hedge position taken would have been to short 98 contracts:  
$$
N_{n e w}=N_{F}-N_{F}r T=N_{F}(1-r T)
$$  

The value for $N_{n e w}$ , which ‘tails the hedge’ has to be recalculated periodically and the hedged position rebalanced as $r$ and $T$ change.

# APPENDIX 5: HEDGE RATIOS  

In this appendix we use a common methodology to derive the optimal number of [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) required in a variety of practical [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) situations. To calculate the hedge-ratio where the [underlying asset](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) to be hedged (e.g. crude oil) is the same as the [underlying asset](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract (i.e. [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) on crude oil), is straightforward. For example, suppose it is January and you expect to sell $10\mathrm{m}$ barrels of crude oil in 3 months’ time in April and you are worried that the oil price in the cash market might fall over the next 3 months. The contract size for one [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) on crude oil is for delivery of $z=1,000$ barrels, hence to hedge you would short:  
$$
N_{F}=-N/z=-\mathrm{{\o{N/z}}}=-\mathrm{{\o{N/z}}}=0\mathrm{{.000}}\mathrm{{barrels}}=-10,000\mathrm{{contracts}}\mathrm{{(short)}}
$$  

# Cross Hedge  

Now consider the case where the cash market asset you wish to hedge difers from the asset deliverable in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract – this is a cross hedge. To demonstrate a ‘quick method’ of deriving the [hedge ratio](../Part%20VI%20-%20The%20Greeks/Chapter%2027%20-%20Delta%20Hedging.md), assume the airline AirOFly wishes to hedge a future cash market purchase of jet fuel using heating oil [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). (We assume there are no highly liquid [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) on jet fuel).9 We have:  
$N=$ number of barrels of fuel required $P=$ cash market price of fuel barrel $R_{J F}\equiv d P/P$ the return fuel $V_{J F}=\$8$ -value of cash market position in fuel $(=N P)$ $F=$ price of heating oil futures gallon $z=$ contract size for futures heating oil delivery of $z=1,000$ gallons $V_{F}=\$8$ -value of [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract heating ${\mathrm{oil}}=z F_{0}$ $N_{F}=$ number of [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) for the hedge to determined  

The dollar change in the hedge-[portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is:  
$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{=N(P_{1}-P_{0})+N_{F}(F_{1}-F_{0})z}\\ {}&{=N P_{0}(d P/P_{0})+N_{F}(z F_{0})(d F/F_{0})=V_{p}(d P/P_{0})+N_{F}V_{F}(d F/F_{0})}\\ {}&{=V_{J F}R_{J F}+(N_{F}V_{F})R_{F}}\end{array}
$$  

The proportionate change in cash market jet fuel prices (i.e. the return on jet fuel) is $R_{J F}\equiv$ $d P/P_{0}$ . The return on heating oil [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) is de!ned as $R_{F}\equiv d F/F_{0}$ . But $F$ depends on the cash market price of heating oil, $s$ and [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) ensures [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) and [spot prices](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md) of heating oil move together. Hence $R_{F}=R_{H O}$ where $R_{H O}$ is the percentage change in the spot price of heating oil. We assume that the return on jet fuel and heating oil (spot) prices are linearly related, $R_{J F}=\beta R_{H O}$ . A hedge position should involve neither a gain nor a loss so we set $d V=0$ and after rearranging:  
$$
N_{F}=-{\frac{V_{J F}}{V_{F}}}\beta
$$  

This is the ‘quick method’ of obtaining the optimal [hedge ratio](../Part%20VI%20-%20The%20Greeks/Chapter%2027%20-%20Delta%20Hedging.md).10 It is !ne except that the relationship for beta, $R_{J F}=\beta R_{H O}$ will only hold ‘on average’ – so the hedge will not give $d V=0$ exactly – but over a number of hedges the dollar change in value $d V$ should be small. As we see below, given that prices are stochastic what we are really trying to do in the hedge is to choose that value for $N_{F}$ which minimises the variance of $d V$ . The correct expression for beta comes from a regression of spot jet fuel [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on the (spot) [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on heating oil:  
$$
R_{J F}=\alpha+\beta R_{H O}+\varepsilon
$$  

Sometimes for [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) over short time periods, absolute rather than percentage changes in prices are used to obtain an estimate of beta, $d P_{J F}=\alpha+\beta d S_{H O}+\varepsilon$ – but the two methods usually give similar estimates.  

# Hedging a Portfolio of Stocks  

We can use the above analysis with minor re-de!nitions to hedge a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks.  
$V_{p}=\mathbb{S}$ -value of cash market stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)   $F=$ index price of [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract underlying $\mathbf{\tau}=$ S&P 500 [stock market](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) index   $V_{F}=\S250F_{0}=\mathrm{nc}$ otional $\$1$ -value of futures contract $\$250$ is the value of an index point on the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract   $N_{F}=$ number of [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) in the hedge to determined  

# Long in the Cash Market  

The cash market position consists of $n$ -stocks with $V_{i}(>0)$ dollars in each stock and a total amount invested of $V_{p}$ dollars. The change in value of the stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is:  
$$
d V_{p}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}d V_{i}=V_{p}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(V_{i}R_{i})/V_{p}=V_{p}\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}R_{i}=V_{p}R_{p}
$$  

For example, if you hold $V_{p}=\$10$ in a diversi!ed portfolio of stocks and the return on the portfolio is $R_{p}=-10\%$ over 1 month (say) then your stock portfolio falls in value by $\$100,000$ . The change in the dollar value of a hedged [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) consisting of $V_{p}$ dollars held in a stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and $N_{F}$ , [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) (SIF) is:  
$$
\begin{array}{l}{d V=\nleq\mathrm{{s}-\mathrm{{change}~i n~s t o c k~p o r t f o l i o}+\nleq\mathrm{{s}-\mathrm{{change}~i n~f u t u r e s~p o s i t i o n}}}}\\ {=V_{p}R_{p}+N_{F}(F_{1}-F_{0})\S250}}\\ {=V_{p}R_{p}+N_{F}V_{F}R_{F}}\end{array}
$$  

where $V_{F}=\$250F_{0}$ and $R_{F}\equiv d F/F_{0}$ . We assume that the index futures price $F$ and the stock market index (S&P 500) move together (because of arbitrage) so ${\cal R}_{F}\equiv{\cal R}_{m}$ (and $R_{m}\equiv d S/S$  

where $S={\mathrm{S}}\&{{\mathrm{P}}~500}$ index). If we assume the return on our [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks is (exactly) linearly related to the market return, $R_{p}=\beta_{p}R_{m}$ and setting $d V=0$ in (5.A.4) then:  
$$
N_{F}=-\frac{V_{p}}{V_{F}}\beta_{p}
$$  

If you are long a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks then $V_{i}>0$ and hence $V_{p}>0$ and as the betas of nearly all stocks are positive then $\beta_{p}>0$ . Hence to hedge a [long position](Chapter%204%20-%20Futures:%20Hedging%20and%20Speculation.md) in a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of stocks, the minus sign in (5.A.5a) indicates that you will short [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md).  

Short-sell in the Cash Market  

Let a short-sale of stock- $j$ be represented by a positive (dollar) value $V_{j}>0$ . So a short-sale of say $\$100$ of stock- $j$ implies a positive value for $V_{j}=+100$ . If you short-sell $m$ -stocks then the total value of the short sales is $V_{S}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}V_{j}>0$ . As we always de!ne the return on a stock as positive (negative) when the price rises (falls) then $d V_{S}=-V_{S}R_{S}$ implies that your cash market short position will increase in value if stock prices fall that is $R_{S}<0$ (and vice-versa). The number of [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) to hedge your short position in stocks is then:  
$$
N_{F}=\frac{V_{S}}{V_{F}}\beta_{S}
$$  

Hence to hedge a short position in stocks, you go long (buy) [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md). (This is discussed further in Chapter 6.)  

Minimum Variance [Hedge Ratio](../Part%20VI%20-%20The%20Greeks/Chapter%2027%20-%20Delta%20Hedging.md) (MVHR)  

The correct (and slightly more involved) way to obtain the above expression for $N_{F}$ given that prices are stochastic, is to derive the minimum variance [hedge ratio](../Part%20VI%20-%20The%20Greeks/Chapter%2027%20-%20Delta%20Hedging.md) MVHR. From (5.A.4):  
$$
\sigma_{d V}^{2}=V_{p}^{2}\sigma_{R_{p}}^{2}+(N_{F}V_{F})^{2}\sigma_{R_{F}}^{2}+2V_{p}V_{F}N_{F}\sigma_{R_{p},R_{F}}
$$  

where $\sigma_{R_{p}}^{2}$ is the variance of the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) return, $\sigma_{R_{p},R_{F}}$ is the covariance between the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) return and the index [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) return. The value of $N_{F}$ which minimizes the variance of the hedge [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is the solution to $\partial{\sigma_{\scriptscriptstyle d V}^{2}}/\partial{N_{\scriptscriptstyle F}}=0$ , that is:  
$$
N_{F}=-{\frac{V_{p}}{V_{F}}}\beta_{p}{\mathrm{~}}{\mathrm{~where~}}\beta_{p}\equiv{\frac{\sigma_{R_{p},R_{F}}}{\sigma_{R_{F}}^{2}}}
$$  

It can be shown that the above expression for $\beta_{p}$ equals the slope coe\$cient in the [OLS regression](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/BUS%2035130%20SPRING%202024%20SOLUTION%20TO%20HOMEWORK%201.md):  
$$
R_{p}=\alpha+\beta_{p}R_{F}+\varepsilon_{p}
$$  

where $R_{p}$ is the proportionate return on the stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and $\varepsilon_{p}$ is a random error. For SIF we assume (because of [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md)) that the index [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) return $R_{F}$ (in Chicago) equals the return on the S&P 500 market index $R_{m}$ (on the NYSE). The ‘market return’ is simply the percentage change in the [stock market](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) index $s$ , so that $R_{m}\equiv d S/S$ where $S=\mathrm{level}$ of S&P 500 index.  

A time series regression of [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) $R_{p}$ on the market return (S&P 500) gives a direct estimate of $\beta_{p}$ . An alternative is to calculate the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) beta from the individual betas of the constituent stocks in the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) using $\begin{array}{r}{\beta_{p}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}\beta_{i}}\end{array}$ . The individual stock betas11 are obtained from a ‘beta book’ purchased from an [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) bank. The $w_{i}=V_{i}/V_{p}$ are the proportions held in each stock, where $V_{i}$ is the dollar amount in stock- $i$ and $V_{p}$ is the total value held in the stock [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). Note that replacing $V_{F}=\$250F_{0}$ in (5.A.7) by the dollar value of the S&P index $\mathbf{\Phi}=\$2505_{0}$ gives:  
$$
N_{F}=-\frac{V_{p}}{\S250S_{0}}\beta_{p}
$$  

which if $F_{0}\approx S_{0}$ gives approximately the same value for $N_{F}$ as (5.A.7).

# Question 2  

In January an investor has a $\$1.20$ long position in a share. The beta of the share is 1.1. The investor intends to close out her position in the share around mid-March and wants to hedge the price-risk using futures. The March Mini S&P 500 future is currently trading at 1,450 (for delivery of $\$50$ times the index). Outline the investor’s [hedging strategy](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%203%20Swaps-%20Financial%20Instruments/The%20Value%20of%20the%20Swap%20Contract%20after%20Initiation.md).
