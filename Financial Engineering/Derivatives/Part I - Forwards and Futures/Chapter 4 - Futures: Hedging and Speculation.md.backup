# Futures: Hedging and Speculation  

# Aims  

• To examine how [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) can be used for [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md).   
• To explain [basis risk](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md), cross hedge and rolling hedge.   
• To examine some novel types of [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md).   
• To show how [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) are used for speculation.  

# 4.1 HEDGING USING FUTURES  

[Futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) can be used for [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) an existing position in a spot (cash-market) asset. For example, an oil producer might have a large amount of oil coming ‘on stream’ in 3 months’ time and may fear a fall in the spot oil price over the next 3 months, so will have to sell their oil at a low spot price. Or, a US exporter who is receiving sterling from the sale of goods in the UK in 3 months, may fear a fall in the spot FX rate for sterling – which implies they will receive fewer dollars when they exchange sterling for dollars.  

In the above cases the seller (of oil or sterling) does not know what the spot/cash market price will be in 3 months’ time and their future (dollar) receipts are therefore subject to price-risk. [Hedging with futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md) can be used to reduce such risk to a minimum. In practice, using [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) cannot reduce price-risk to zero so a ‘perfect hedge’ is usually not possible.  

# 4.1.1 Short Hedge  

The basic idea behind [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) is very simple. If you are holding (i.e. long) the [underlying asset](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) (e.g. stock-ABC) then you need to take a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position (on stock-ABC) such that the monetary gain, after closing out the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract, largely o!sets any monetary losses in the spot market, over your chosen hedge period. [Futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) and [spot prices](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md) tend to rise and fall together (approximately) dollar-for-dollar because arbitrageurs ensure that $F=S(1+r T)$ at all times. Hence, on 25 June in order to hedge a [long position](.md) in stock-ABC with price $S_{0}=\$100$ (over the next 3 months, $T=1/4)$ , you need to short (i.e. sell) September-futures contracts today. If on 25 June the risk-free rate is $r=1\%$ , and the quoted September-futures price is $F_{0}=\mathfrak{S}100.25\left(=S_{0}(1+r T)\right)$ .  

If the spot/cash market price of the stock falls by $\$10$ (on the NYSE) to $S_{1}=\$90$ over the next 3 months, then arbitrageurs will ensure that the [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) (which matures close to 25 September) will also be close to $F_{1}=\$90$ . You initially sold the futures contract for $F_{0}=$ $\$100.25$ on 25 June and on 25 September you can ‘buy back’ the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract (i.e. close out your [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position) at $F_{1}=\$90$ . Your proft is $F_{0}-F_{1}=\$10.25$ – which you obtain from the clearing house in Chicago.  

A ‘sell’ followed by a ‘buy’ for [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) (with the same maturity date and [underlying asset](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md)) means that any delivery to you of the stock is nullifed. Closing out means ‘no delivery’ – just the [cash settlement](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Swaptions.md) of $\$10.25$ . Here, the gain on the futures hedge of $\$10.25$ more than o!sets the $\$10$ loss on your stocks. Without the hedge you would have lost $\$10$ .  

A hedge is designed to result in no change in the value of your overall position (i.e. stocks plus [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)). You therefore forego the prospect of any overall gains (or losses) when you use [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) for [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md).  

Let’s examine the above hedge in more detail. On 25 June Ms Long holds one stock-ABC with a spot (cash market) price $S_{0}=\$100$ . Normally Ms Long is willing to accept the price risk of stock-ABC. But suppose over the next 3 months $T=1/4$ year), she thinks the [stock market](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) will be more volatile than normal and in particular she fears an exceptionally large fall in stock prices by 25 September, when she might want to sell her stock-ABC or her trading position will be assessed.  

To remove any price risk she could sell stock-ABC on 25 June for $S_{0}=\$100$ and invest the $\$100$ in an interest bearing bank deposit until 25 September, when she could either (a) repurchase the stock-ABC possibly at a lower price $(S_{1}=\S90)$ ) or at a higher price ${}^{\prime}S_{1}=\$110,$ , or (b) continue to hold cash in the deposit account which will have accrued to $\$100.25=S_{0}(1+r T)$ .  

There are problems with this strategy. First, if she invests in the bank deposit on 25 June but later, on 25 September, she decides she wants to hold the stock, then she must repurchase stock-ABC at either the low price of $S_{1}=\$90$ which would be advantageous, or at the high price $S_{1}=\$110$ which would be expensive (relative to the initial price of $S_{0}=\$100$ on 25 June). But on 25 June she does not know which of these outcomes might occur, so this strategy has not removed price risk – if she subsequently wants to hold the stock. Also this strategy requires selling stock-ABC on 25 June and repurchasing stock-ABC on 25 September – so she will incur transactions costs in the form of bid–ask spreads and commissions. However, if she is certain she wants to hold cash on 25 September, then investing in the bank deposit guarantees she will have a cash amount of $S_{0}(1+r T)$ in her deposit account on 25 September.  

Instead of using the above strategy, Ms Long can hedge her existing stock position on 25 June by [shorting](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Short%20Selling.md) a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract. This means that if stock prices rise or fall dramatically between 25 June and 25 September, Ms Long will continue to hold her stocks-ABC (and hence avoid any transactions costs of buying and selling). In addition, with the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) hedge in place she will have neither gained or lost and hence has removed any price risk (unlike the case above). Although [hedging with futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md) allows Ms Long to o!set any losses from a fall in stock prices, it does not allow Ms Long to beneft from a rise in stock prices – but this is the outcome that [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) is designed to produce.  

The September-[futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) on 25 June is $F_{0}=\$100.25$ . Can Ms Long who holds stocks-ABC guarantee an outcome of (around) $\$100.25$ on 25 September? Note that on 25 June, the outcome Ms Long seeks to achieve is an e!ective value for her stocks of $F_{0}=\$100.25$ in 3 months’ time – she cannot lock in the current stock price $S_{0}=\$100$ .  

On 25 June Ms Long initiates the hedge by selling ([shorting](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Short%20Selling.md)) the September-[futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract at $F_{0}=\$100.25$ (but no money changes hands). Suppose that on 25 September the price of stock-ABC has fallen to $S_{1}=\$90$ and the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) to $F_{1}=\$90$ (Table 4.1).

On 25 September Ms Long closes out her [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position by buying (back) the September-[futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) at the lower price $F_{1}=\$90$ , making a proft of $(F_{0}-F_{1})=\$10.25$ – which approximately o!sets the loss in the spot market of $\$10$ (Table 4.2). The value $V_{1}$ (on 25 September) of Ms Long’s hedged [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is:  
$V_{\mathrm{1}}=\mathrm{Spot}$ price of stock- $\cdot\mathbf{ABC}+\mathbb{S}$ -Change in [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position  
$$
=S_{1}+(F_{0}-F_{1})=(S_{1}-F_{1})+F_{0}=\S100.25
$$

$F_{0}$ is known at the outset of the hedge on 25 June but $S_{1}$ and $F_{1}$ are not. Hence the risk in the hedge depends on ‘the basis’ where:  
$$
{\mathrm{Final~basis:}}b_{1}=S_{1}-F_{1}
$$  

In our example the value of the hedged [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is $\$100.25$ (on 25 September) and this equals the quoted futures price $F_{0}$ on 25 June – so Ms Long on 25 June has fxed the value of her portfolio, even if the stock price falls. This is a perfect hedge because we made the fnal basis, $b_{1}$ equal to zero – as we assume the futures contract matures on (or near) 25 September so that $S_{1}=F_{1}$ . In general, if the contract is closed out before the maturity date then $b_{1}$ will not be zero (but it will be small) – hence there is always some [basis risk](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md) in a hedge.  

Note that in the hedge, the price that is ‘locked in’ is the [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) $F_{0}$ and not the spot price $S_{0}$ . In fact, the spot price at the outset $S_{0}=\$100$ plays no direct role in the calculation of the value of the hedged position on 25 September (see Equation (4.1)). The only transactions cost you incur are in selling then buying back the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) and these costs are very small (and usually much lower in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) market than on the NYSE).  

If the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract had been on ‘live cattle’ and you require your cattle in Boston it should be obvious that it is better not to pay $F_{0}=100.25$ on 25 September and take delivery of cattle in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract near Chicago (the delivery point in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract). It is more convenient to take the cash proft on the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) of $\$10.25$ , buy your cattle on 25 September in the local market in Boston at the spot price $S_{1}=\$90$ , since then you do not have the additional cost of transporting the cattle between Chicago and Boston. Closing out (just before maturity) rather than delivery (on the maturity date $T$ ), also happens with many fnancial [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) (e.g. on stocks, bonds, FX). Also some [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) can only be cash settled at maturity rather than taking delivery (e.g. [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) on the S&P 500 index, where it would be extremely inconvenient and costly to ‘deliver’ 500 stocks).  

An alternative way of representing the hedge is to examine the net proft , that is, the loss (gain) on the spot position relative to the gain (loss) on the short [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position.  

Change in spot price Change in [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)  
$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{=(S_{1}-S_{0})-(F_{1}-F_{0})=(\S90-\S100)-(\S90-\S100.25)=+\S0.25}\\ &{=(S_{1}-F_{1})-(S_{0}-F_{0})=b_{1}-b_{0}}\end{array}
$$  

In this example, the gain on the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position is $\$10.25$ which more than o!sets the loss on the spot position of $\$10$ and hence the hedge is broadly successful. The proft from the hedged position depends on the change in the basis. The change in the basis is small because spot and [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) prices are highly correlated. Thus the hedge position is much less risky than the unhedged position – since without the hedge the loss (or gain) would be the much larger amount $S_{1}-S_{0}$ . Note also that the ‘initial basis’ $b_{0}$ is known and ‘fxed’ at the outset of the hedge. It is the ‘fnal basis’ $b_{1}=S_{1}-F_{1}$ that is the source of uncertainty in the net proft.

# 4.1.2 Long Hedge  

Suppose on 25 June, the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) manager of a [pension fund](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md), Ms Wait, knows she will receive a cash infow in 3 months’ time on 25 September (from contributors to the [pension fund](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md)), which she will use to purchase stocks. The [stock price](../Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Black–Scholes%20Model.md) on 25 June is $S_{0}=\$100$ – but she knows she cannot lock in this price by [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) – she can only lock in today’s quoted [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md).  

She is worried that stock prices will rise – so her stocks will cost more in 3 months, when the cash arrives to purchase them. To hedge, Ms Wait goes long (i.e. buys) a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract on 25 June at $F_{0}=\$100.25$ and takes delivery of the stocks in 3 months and pays $\$100.25$ per stock (in Chicago) on 25 September. Alternatively, Ms Wait could simply close out her position by selling the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract on 25 September (see Table 4.3).  

Suppose we have the same outcome as before, namely the stock prices falls to $S_{1}=\$90$ , as does the futures price $S_{1}=\$90$ . The cost of buying the stocks in the cash market (on the NYSE) is $S_{1}=\$90$ , but the cash loss from the long futures is $F_{0}-F_{1}=\S100.25-\S90=\S10.25$ , making a net cost of buying the stocks on 25 September $=\$90+\S10.25=\S100.25$ . Hence, the hedge when cash settled also ‘locks in’ the [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) $F_{0}=\$100.25$ . Again, this is because we have assumed the fnal basis $b_{1}=S_{1}-F_{1}$ is zero.  

Some might fnd it confusing that the hedge does not ‘lock in’ a price of $S_{0}=\$100$ on 25 September. But this is impossible since the price $S_{0}=\$100$ on the NYSE applies to 25 June – you can only ‘lock in’ the [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) $F_{0}$ (quoted on 25 June for maturity on 25 September).  

Note that with hindsight, it would have been better if the hedge had not been undertaken, since then the cost of buying the stocks on 25 September would have been $S_{1}=\$90$ . However, when the hedge was initiated in June, the hedger could not have known that the price would fall over the next 3 months – hindsight is a wonderful thing.  

# EXAMPLE 4.1

If the stock price on the NYSE rises by $\$10$ to  

(continued)  

# (continued)  
$S_{1}=\$110$ on 25 September, then $F_{1}\approx\$110$ in Chicago. ([Arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) ensures that $F_{1}\approx S_{1}$ close to the maturity date of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract.)  

# Outcome  

On 25 September Ms Wait closes out (sells) her [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) at $F_{1}\approx\$110$ making a cash proft of $F_{1}-F_{0}=\$9.75$ , credited to her by the clearing house in Chicago. Although the stocks cost $\$10$ more to buy on the NYSE on 25 September, this higher cost is mostly o!set by the $\$9.75$ proft from the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) trade – so the hedge is successful.  

The e!ective purchase price for the stocks on 25 September is $S_{1}=\$110$ minus the cash proft of $\$9.75$ from the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position, that is $\$100.25$ – which is the same as the quoted futures price on 25 June $F_{0}=\$100.25$ . Hence this hedge has locked in the known [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) quoted on 25 June.  

In the above examples we assume (for expositional clarity) that on 25 September, $F_{1}=S_{1}$ . In practice this equality only holds exactly on the delivery/maturity date of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract which might be a few days later at $T=28$ September (say). If $S_{1}=\$90$ on 25 September then $F_{1}$ might actually be equal to $\$90.1$ (say) rather than $F=\$90$ assumed above. Hence the fnal basis would be $b_{1}=(S_{1}-F_{1})=-0.1$ , so the above numerical results would be slightly di!erent but the general points made are still valid.  

# 4.1.3 Cross Hedge  

If the asset underlying the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is not the same as the asset held by the hedger then there is an additional source of [basis risk](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md). Let $S^{H O}$ be the cash market price of heating oil and $F^{H O}$ the price of a heating oil [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract.  

On 25 June, Cloud-9, an airline, knows that it is going to purchase jet fuel in 2 months’ time on 25 August, at its hub airport (LAX) at the cash market price $S^{J F}$ . But it fears a rise in jet fuel prices. Suppose there is no [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract available on jet fuel1 so Cloud-9 hedges by going long September-heating oil [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) (with a maturity date on 28 September). The e!ective cost $V_{1}$ of the jet fuel for Cloud-9 on 25 August (when the airline closes out its heating oil [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md)) is:  

V1 Spot price fuel cash proft heating oil [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) S퐽1+ F1() F0()  

which can be written:  
$$
\begin{array}{l}{{V_{1}=F_{0}^{H O}-[(F_{1}^{H O}-S_{1}^{J F})+(S_{1}^{J F}-S_{1}^{H O})]}}\\ {{\ =F_{0}^{H O}+b_{1}^{H O}+(S_{1}^{J F}-S_{1}^{H O})}}\end{array}
$$  

so there is an additional source of [basis risk](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md) arising from the di!erence between the [spot prices](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md) of jet fuel and heating oil on 25 August. Also since $b_{1}^{H O}=S_{1}^{H O}-F_{1}^{H O}$ equals zero only on the maturity date of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) (28 September), the choice of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) [delivery month](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/One-Month%20SOFR%20Futures.md) is important.  

Clearly if you are going to close out your [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position on 25 August, then on 25 June you must choose a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract that matures after 25 August. Also, the size of the fnal basis $b_{1}^{H O}=S_{1}^{H O}-F_{1}^{H O}$ is more uncertain, the longer the gap between the end of the hedge period $(t_{1}=25$ August) and the maturity of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract (here $T=28$ September). It is therefore best to choose a [delivery month](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/One-Month%20SOFR%20Futures.md) that is just after the hedge period – as this [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is likely to be heavily traded, with high [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) and low transactions costs.  

For example, suppose on 25 June when Cloud-9 initiates its hedge, heating oil [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) are available with maturity dates on 27 June, 28 September, 29 December and (next year on) 25 March. If you intend to close out the hedge on 25 August then you should probably use the September contract – this will ensure the fnal basis is reasonably small (i.e. $S_{1}^{H\bar{O}}\approx F_{1}^{H O\bar{\nu}},$ and the hedge will work reasonably well.  

# 4.1.4 Rolling Hedge  

Assume it is now 5 April 2019 and Ms Refner is holding 10,000 barrels of oil (i.e. she is long the underlying) which she will sell on 5 January 2020. She fears a price fall, so to hedge she needs to sell (short) oil [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), today. The contract size for oil [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) is for delivery of 1,000 barrels, so to hedge her cash-market position of 10,000 barrels she needs to sell (short) ten [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md). [Futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) are available with maturity dates on the 28th of the month for June-2019, September-2019, December-2019 and March-2020. However, on 5 April she feels that only the ‘nearby’ June-2019 contract is liquid enough (with low transactions costs) to use in the hedge.  

One possible scenario is that on 5 April 2019 she shorts ten June-2019 [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md). Towards the end of June she buys back the ten June-2019 contracts which are about to expire and she simultaneously shorts ten September-2019 contracts (which are now the ‘nearby contract’). Towards the end of September-2019 she closes out (buys back) these ten September-2019 contracts and then shorts ten December-2019 [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md). Finally, at the end of December-2019 she closes out (buys back) these ten December-2019 contracts – leaving her unhedged for a short period until 5 January 2020.  

Every 3 months, she hedges using the ‘next nearby contract’. This is a rolling hedge as she periodically ‘rolls over’ into the next nearby contract. Spot and [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) prices move approximately dollar-for-dollar. So, for example, if the spot price of oil falls continuously over the coming year, she receives less from selling her barrels of oil, but this is o!set by cash receipts $(F_{s e l l}-F_{b u y}>0)\$ when she closes out the ten short [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) by buying them back at a lower price, when each contract matures. She therefore executes a rolling hedge, over each 3-month period, always using the next nearby (liquid) contract.  

An example of a rolling hedge with energy [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) undertaken by the German frm Metallgesellschaft can be found in Finance Blog 4.1 – it illustrates some of the practical di\$culties of trying to maintain a hedge by rolling over short-dated [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md).  

# Finance Blog 4.1 Metallgesellschaft’s Rolling Hedge  

Perhaps the most famous calamitous rolling hedge was that undertaken by MGRM, a US subsidiary of the German frm Metallgesellschaft. Unfortunately, in 1993/94, this rolling hedge using various [commodity futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md) resulted in losses of around $\$1.30\mathrm{n}$ , with the result that the frm had to be bailed out by a consortium of banks.  

MGRM o!ered US frms long-term fxed-price purchase contracts on oil products (e.g. diesel fuel, heating oil and gasoline) for up to 10-year horizons, at prices around $\$4$ below current [spot prices](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md). MGRM had to deliver these oil products in the future at the agreed fxed price – and hence was vulnerable to a future rise in spot (cash market) oil prices. It therefore hedged (part) of its position by going long in the appropriate [commodity futures contracts](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/1.%20EXPLOITING%20AN%20APPARENT%20ARBITRAGE%20OPPORTUNITY.md) (e.g. contracts on unleaded gasoline, New York Harbour No. 2 heating oil and light-sweet crude oil – all traded on NYMEX, the New York Mercantile Exchange).  

However, because of illiquidity in the far-dated [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md), MGRM used short maturity contracts, which it then had to roll over. By September 1993 MGRM had sold [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) covering 80 million barrels of oil (equivalent to about 90 days of Kuwait’s output).  

A problem arose near the end of 1993 when [spot prices](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md) fell substantially. Therefore MGRM was making a potential notional gain on its future spot oil purchases but this was a gain it could not realise – since the negotiated fxed-price sale contracts applied to delivery in future years so MGRM was not currently purchasing all its oil requirements in the cash market – as [storage costs](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Primary%20vs.%20Secondary%20Commodities.md) would have been prohibitive.  

However, [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) prices fell along with [spot prices](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md) and as MGRM was long [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), it incurred [margin calls](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md). Remember that when [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md), there is nothing unusual about making a loss on [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md), since you should then be making a (notional) gain in the spot (oil) market – this is how [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) works. But the ‘immediate’ cash drain (of $\$900m$ in 1993) from the parent company, to pay [variation margin](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Repurchase%20Agreements.md) calls on all its [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) positions, was not o!set by actual cash profts by buying spot oil at low prices and selling at high fxed prices to its customers.  

Because of the cash drain from [margin calls](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md), the parent company eventually chose to close out their long [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) by selling them at a lower price and at a huge loss. Metallgesellschaft was saved from liquidation by a consortium of banks in January 1994, who lent the frm $\$1.2b n$ . Six months later, spot oil prices increased so that MGRM’s now unhedged position, incurred further potential losses.  

The lesson here is that in a hedge, there must be su\$cient cash resources to meet [margin calls](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md). Also, had a uniform fall in [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) prices of all maturities occurred, then MGRM would have continued to ‘roll over’ at a proft, but the move from backwardation to contango in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) market in November 1993 meant it was rolling over its [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) at a loss.

• If you are long the cash-market asset (e.g. stocks) and hence fear a price fall, then hedge by taking a short [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position today (i.e. sell [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md)).   
• If you are planning to purchase the asset in the future (i.e. you are short in the cash market) and hence fear a price rise, then hedge by going long today (i.e. buy a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract).   
• Choose a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract which is written on the spot (cash-market) asset in question. This maximises the correlation between $F$ and S. Otherwise use a cross-hedge where there is a high correlation between the cash market asset you are trying to hedge (e.g. jet fuel) and the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract used in the hedge (e.g. heating oil [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)).   
• For [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) over a relatively short period of time, choose a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract with an [expiration date](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) just longer than the hedge period. This minimises [basis risk](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md) since you close out just before the maturity date $(T)$ of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), so $F_{1}\approx S_{1}$ .   
• Suppose the hedge is for a long period and [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) with long maturity dates are either not available or illiquid with high transactions costs (bid–ask spreads, etc.). Then choose liquid, short-dated [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) (i.e. the next nearby contract) and ‘roll over’ the hedge as each ‘short-dated’ [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract approaches its maturity date.   
• Losses on the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position may involve payments of ‘[variation margin](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Repurchase%20Agreements.md)’ and therefore a hedger must have lines of credit or other assets available to meet these [margin calls](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md).   
• You need to choose the appropriate number of [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) to use in the hedge – this is discussed in Chapter 5.  

# 4.2 NOVEL FUTURES CONTRACTS  

This book is primarily concerned with [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) positions in fnancial assets (and to a lesser extent in tradable [commodities](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) such as oil and gas) but it is worthwhile refecting on the possibility of [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) more general risks that society faces. For example, almost all major countries such as the USA, UK, Japan, Australia, Brazil, and Asia have experienced booms and slumps in the housing and commercial property markets. If you have recently purchased a house only to fnd that its value has plummeted, this can be devastating. Conversely, if frst-time buyers fail to buy before a major housing boom, they can be excluded from homeownership for a long time (and maybe forever). Take another even more powerful example. Individuals cannot adequately insure against major changes in their real incomes – through no fault of their own (e.g. booms and slumps either nationally or regionally and in particular industries). There seems to be no adequate mechanism for individuals to insure against these social risks. Could [derivatives](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) markets be used to provide such insurance and hence ‘spread’ these risks across a wide number of participants – just like when we use [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) to hedge changes in commodity and stock prices?  

Robert Shiller of Yale University, who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2013 (along with Eugene Fama), favours the establishment of [futures markets](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md) based on house (and other real estate) price indices and on ‘perpetual claims’ on income. These contracts could be used to hedge the price risk involved in owning a home and the risk of unforeseen changes in income (e.g. your own occupational income or the real income (GDP) of the whole domestic economy). Shiller (1993) provides a provocative analysis of these issues, some of which are outlined in Finance Blog 4.2.  

# Finance Blog 4.2 Future Futures? Hedging House Prices  

In principle, the idea here is a straightforward application of [hedging with futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md). Suppose there is a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract based on your own house price. If you own a house, then to hedge you would short ‘house-price’ [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). If your house price falls then so would the [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) and you could close out your long [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position by buying back the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract at a proft – this would compensate for the loss in the (spot) market value of your house. Of course, if your house price increased you would lose on your short [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position, but this is exactly counterbalanced by the increase in the value of your property.  

If you are thinking of entering the market as a frst-time buyer in the future then you could hedge any potential rise in [house prices](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%206%20Mortgage%20Backed%20Securities.md) by today purchasing (i.e. going long) ‘house-price’ [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). If [house prices](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%206%20Mortgage%20Backed%20Securities.md) rise, then the cash proft after closing out your long [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position, could be used to o!set the increase in the purchase price of the house.  

Shiller notes that the matter is not so simple in practice. Because people are relatively unfamiliar with [futures markets](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md) then savings and loans associations (building societies, banks) would have to sell ‘standard’ house price [insurance contracts](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Risk%20Sharing.md) (rather like fre and theft insurance) to their customers – and it would be the fnancial institutions that would hedge their position using [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). Also, the [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) would have to be written on house price indices, not on the price of an individual’s house – this is to avoid ‘[moral hazard](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md)’ problems. For example, if the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is on your own house price and you have shorted [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), then you may have an incentive to allow your house to go into disrepair, since its spot price would then fall leading to a fall in the [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md). You could then close out your short [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position at a proft.  

Using [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) on house price indices would be a cross-hedge, with some [basis risk](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md) remaining. Of course, if this type of [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract became popular then they could be written on regional/local house price indices as well on indices of state-wide or economy-wide [house prices](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%206%20Mortgage%20Backed%20Securities.md).  

[Cash and carry](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Cash-And-Carry%20Arbitrage.md) [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) is needed to establish the correct (no-[arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md)) [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) but ‘delivery’ of a ‘homogeneous house’ (i.e. the [underlying asset](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract) is somewhat di\$cult! But if [stock price](../Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Black–Scholes%20Model.md) indices based on the performance of real estate companies are available, [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) becomes less problematic.  

In the actual co!ee [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) market (on CME-NYMEX) ‘expert tasters’ are used (along with more objective criteria) to establish the ‘quality’ of the delivered co!ee. However, since the quality of housing depends on such factors as site, neighbourhood, proximity of transport, schools, shops etc., it is unlikely that experts could agree on what constitutes a ‘homogenous house’. Hence the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract would have to be cash settled, based on a house price index that takes account of quality di!erences.  

The frm Case-Shiller-Weiss has developed such price indices for US property, using repeat sales prices and incorporating characteristics of the quality of the house, (known as hedonic price indices). The basic idea is to regress observed [house prices](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%206%20Mortgage%20Backed%20Securities.md) $p_{i t}(i=\mathrm{house},$ $t=$ time on a set of characteristics (e.g. square metres of foor space, whether the house has air conditioning units or not, number and quality of schools in the area, distance from retail centre, etc.). One can then estimate a predictive equation for house price indices (for a geographical area) or even obtain an estimate of the value of individual houses. Predictions of individual [house prices](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%206%20Mortgage%20Backed%20Securities.md) can be ‘tested’ against actual sales prices. The [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract can then be based on these ‘underlying’ hedonic house price indices.  

Another practical problem is margin payments. If you are short housing [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) and [house prices](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%206%20Mortgage%20Backed%20Securities.md) rise, you may receive [margin calls](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md). But you may not have su\$cient liquid assets to pay the [margin calls](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md). Although the value of your house has risen, you cannot sell part of it to obtain the cash to cover your [margin calls](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md). This problem is mitigated if it is a fnancial intermediary that is undertaking the [short hedge](.md) (and has sold a ‘house price’ insurance policy to the homeowner).

Shiller also considered the risks to individuals from changing household incomes as relative earnings change over long periods of time (for example, incomes in the industrial sector may fall relative to those in the information technology [IT] sector over a 10-year period).  

[Hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) using [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) based on an underlying index of national, regional or occupational incomes, works in much the same way as for [house prices](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%206%20Mortgage%20Backed%20Securities.md). (But note that Shiller’s actual proposal is more subtle being based on ‘long-run’ or perpetual income, rather than current or next year’s income). If your ‘own-income’ is positively correlated with regional income, then you (or more likely a fnancial institution who sold you an ‘income insurance policy’) would hedge by [shorting](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Short%20Selling.md) ‘regional income [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)’ contracts. If your income fell and along with it regional income, then you would receive margin payments (from the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) clearing house). These margin receipts could then be reinvested in a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of income claims in a wide variety of other countries, which would have less variability than your own income stream – hence reducing your overall income risk. The problem of a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)-hedger meeting margin payments remains a problem and requires banks to lend against future income – for the purpose of covering these margin payments.  

There are many other practical and provocative ideas in Shiller’s books Macro Markets (1994) and Finance and the Good Society (2013). Who knows, in the future, your children may use these types of [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract to hedge some of their key long-term ‘lifetime risks’.  

# 4.3 SPECULATION  

Speculation with [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) is relatively straightforward. Consider speculation using a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract on stock-ABC. (We deal with speculation using ‘[stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) contracts’ in Chapter 5.) You are using [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) to gamble on forecasts for the price of stock-ABC.  

If you think the price of stock-ABC will rise (fall) in the future (on the NYSE) then today you will speculate by buying (selling) a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract (on stock-ABC) at $F_{0}$ in Chicago. If you forecast the direction of change in stock prices and hence future prices, then you will be able to close out your [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position at a proft – if you forecast incorrectly you will close out your [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position at a loss. Speculation is risky.  

If you close out a long [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position before maturity then the proft/loss on each [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is $F_{1}-F_{0}$ (i.e. $F_{1}-F_{0}>0$ if $F_{1}>F_{0}$ and $F_{1}-F_{0}<0$ if $F_{1}<F_{0}\dot{.}$ ). On the maturity date $(T)$ of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), the [stock price](../Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Black–Scholes%20Model.md) and [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) must be equal (because of [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md)) $S_{T}=F_{T}$ . Hence, if a speculator holds the long [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contact to maturity $(=T)$ , she can pay $F_{0}$ , at $T_{:}$ , take delivery of the stock (in Chicago) and immediately sell it on the NYSE for $S_{T}$ . Hence her speculative proft at $T$ on her long [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position at maturity is $S_{T}-F_{0}$ (which can be either positive or negative).  

Similar arguments to the above apply if a speculator initially sells a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract, because she thinks the [stock price](../Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Black–Scholes%20Model.md) and hence the [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) will fall, on or before the maturity date of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract.  

# 4.3.1 Speculation with Stocks Versus Futures Contracts  

What are the institutional di!erences between speculating on changes in the price of stock-ABC on the NYSE and [speculating with futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) (on stock-ABC) in Chicago. If you speculate by buying stock-ABC on the NYSE you (may) have to use your ‘own funds’ to buy the stock and pay any transactions costs (bid–ask spreads and brokers’ commissions). If you use [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) on the stock, the long [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position provides [leverage](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md), since you do not have to use any ‘own funds’ when you initiate the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position (and transactions costs in [futures markets](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md) are generally much lower than those on the NYSE).  

When using [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) you have to place a relatively small ‘good faith deposit’ in your margin account. Of course, if you are long (short) the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) and the [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) falls (rises) then you may have to ‘top up’ your margin account and speculators therefore need ready cash or collateral (e.g. T-bills) available.  

For a speculator holding stock-ABC to beneft from a forecast rise in stock prices, she can (in principle) wait indefnitely for the price to rise. In contrast, when taking a speculative [long position](.md) in a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract, the [stock price](../Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Black–Scholes%20Model.md) must rise before the maturity date in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract. There is a ‘time limit’ when using a long [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position for speculation.  

When using stocks to bet on a fall in stock prices a speculator has to short-sell stocks. However, if she cannot ‘borrow’ the stock from her brokers for a long enough time period she may not be able to ‘hold’ her short position long enough to beneft from the predicted fall in stock prices. Similarly, when using a short [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position to gain from a fall in stock (and [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)) prices, the [stock price](../Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Black–Scholes%20Model.md) must fall before the maturity date in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract. In practice there is a ‘time limit’, either when short-selling a stock or when speculating using a short [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position – the former time limit is somewhat uncertain (depending on your relationship with your broker) and for the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), the time limit is fxed by the maturity of the contract.  

Speculators take an ‘open’ or ‘naked’ position and hence the transaction is risky. There are three broad types of speculator: scalpers/algorithmic traders, day traders and position traders.  

• Scalpers (Algorithmic traders, High Frequency Traders, HFT) transact (mainly) on electronic platforms and may close out their positions within milli-seconds or at most minutes. Traders who use graphs of tick-by-tick prices to predict changes in [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) prices come under the generic term ‘chartists’ of ‘technical analysis’. Algorithmic traders buy and sell based on complex mathematical formulas often based on very short-term price movements and volume/turnover in the market often helps predict future short-term price movements.   
• Day Traders usually close out their positions within a few hours, or at most within the trading day. They often trade, based on their views about ‘news items’ (e.g. future company dividend outcomes, forecasts of changes in [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) or FX rates) that may a!ect [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) prices.   
• Position Traders may hold their positions for as little as one day to one month, or more. An outright open (naked) position in [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) is extremely risky so ‘position traders’ often engage in spread trading. • Spread trading involves long-short trades in two di!erent [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md), so that there is a negative correlation between the two [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) positions and this reduces the risk exposure. The [margin requirements](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Case%20Study%20Mf%20Globals%20Repo-To-Maturity%20Trades.md) for spread trades are usually less than for open/naked positions. The two main types of spread trading in [futures markets](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md) are: – Intracommodity spread: a long and short position in two [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) on the same [underlying asset](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) – but with di!erent maturity dates. – Intercommodity spread: a long and short position in two di!erent [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) (e.g. on Microsoft and Apple stocks) – but with the same maturity date.  

An intracommodity spread relies on the fact that [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) prices on long maturity dated contracts, move more than [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) prices on nearby contracts, when there is a change in the [underlying asset price](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md).2 For example, if on 25 January you think a large rise in oil prices is likely over the next month, you would take a [long position](.md) in a long-maturity oil-[futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract (e.g. the December-[futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)) and a short position in a short-maturity contract (e.g. the March-[futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)). Even if the spread trader forecasts incorrectly and it turns out that prices of oil fall, the large loss on the long-[futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) is partly o!set by the gain on the short position.  

An example, of an intercommodity spread is when a US investor takes a [long position](.md) on 25 January in a sterling [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract (with December maturity date) and a short position in yen [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) (also with a December maturity date). The speculator is gambling on a sterling appreciation (against the US dollar) which exceeds that for the yen (against the US dollar) then the spread trader after closing out both contracts will make an overall proft. If the US investor’s forecast is incorrect, some (or all) of the losses on the long sterling contract may be o!set by the gains on the short yen contract.  

# 4.4 SUMMARY  

• If an investor is long the underlying cash-market asset (e.g. holds stocks, gold, oil, wheat, etc.) then to hedge, they should sell (short) [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) today (and vice versa), and close out the [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) at the end of the hedge period. Any change in price of the spot asset should be largely o!set by the proft/loss on the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position.   
• There is always some [basis risk](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md) in a hedge – the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) and [spot prices](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md) may not move exactly dollar-for-dollar because of changes in [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md), the yield on the [underlying asset](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) (e.g. dividend yield), [storage costs](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Primary%20vs.%20Secondary%20Commodities.md) and the convenience yield (for [commodity futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md)).   
• The maturity of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract used in the hedge is usually greater than the maximum horizon over which you want to hedge (e.g. 3 months, 1 year) but this will also depend on [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) and transactions costs associated with the specifc [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract chosen.   
• The most conventional hedge is to use a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract that matures just after the end of the chosen hedge period. However, when [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) over a long period, long-dated [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) may be illiquid and then short-dated (nearby) [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) can be used and ‘rolled over’ into the next short dated contract – this strategy has ‘roll-over risk’ and more [basis risk](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md) than a conventional hedge.   
• Speculation with [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) allows almost unlimited [leverage](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) (since any margin payments you have to provide are small and usually earn interest). Hence the proportionate gain (on any own-funds used) is higher for speculation with [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), than speculation by purchasing the underlying cash-market asset using your ‘own funds’.  

# EXERCISES  

# Question 1  

Explain how a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract on a stock-X can be used for [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) your current holdings in stock-X.  

# Question 2  

What is [basis risk](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md) in a hedge and is it ever zero?  

# Question 3  

Why might you need to ‘roll over the hedge’ when using [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md)?  

# Question 4  

Why would an oil consumer (Haulage Plc) use a ‘[futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) hedge’ to remove ‘price risk’ on its future purchases of oil in the cash market?  

# Question 5  

You hold a stock worth $S_{0}$ . Does a ‘perfect hedge’ using [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), involve locking in the current spot price, so the value of your [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in the future will equal its current value? Consider closing out the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) either before maturity or at maturity.  

# Question 6  

Discuss the basic idea behind Shiller’s approach to [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) house price changes by using ‘novel’ future contracts.  

# Question 7  

Suppose you hedge a [long position](.md) in stocks (currently worth $S_{0}$ ), using [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) (with current price $F_{0.}^{\mathrm{~\tiny~.~}}$ ). Do you ‘lock in’ a known value for your [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in the future? Alternatively, are any losses/gains in the value of your stocks exactly compensated by gains/losses, when you close out your [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md)? Assume you close-out your [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) just before maturity at $F_{1}$ (and your stocks are worth $S_{1}$ ). Explain.
