# T-bond Futures  

# Aims  

• To examine contract details for [UK Gilt futures](.md) and US T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) including the conversion factor, the [cheapest-to-deliver](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md) bond and wild card play. • To determine the optimal number of T-bond [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) for [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md). • To determine the fair price of a T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract using [cash-and-carry arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Dollar%20Rolls.md). • To analyse [speculative strategies](.md) using T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). This includes spread trades and altering the e!ective [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of a bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) to take advantage of market timing strategies.  

Some of the practical details of T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) are quite intricate. A long T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position allows the holder to take delivery of a long maturity T-bond at expiration of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract. As with all [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md), T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) can be used for speculation, [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md), and [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md). [Hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) allows the investor to [eliminate price risk](.md) of her bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).  

For example, suppose Ms Bond holds $\$200$ in (cash market) 20-year T-bonds and she fears a rise in long-term yields over the next 6 months. Ms Bond should hedge by [shorting](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Short%20Selling.md) (selling) T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). If long rates do subsequently rise, the price of her cash-market T-bonds will fall but so does the [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md). Hence, she can close out her short [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position at a proft by buying back the T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) at a lower price. The proft from the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position compensates for the loss in value of her cash market position in T-bonds.  

If Ms Bond wants to act as a speculator and she forecasts that long-term yields will fall in the future then today she would purchase T-bond [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md). If yields fall, then the [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) will rise and she can close out her [long position](../Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%204%20-%20Futures:%20Hedging%20and%20Speculation.md) in T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) at a higher price – hence making a speculative proft.  

Ms Bond gains [leverage](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) by purchasing the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract rather than purchasing T-bonds in the cash market (with her own funds) – because she only has to provide a relatively small initial [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) margin (and not the [full price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%201/Accrued%20Interest.md) of the cash market bond). Transactions costs (e.g. bid–ask spreads, clearing, and brokerage fees) in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) market might also be lower than those in the cash market.  

Naked [speculative positions](../../../International%20Finance/The%20Eurocurrency%20and%20Eurobond%20Markets%20Annotations.md) in T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) are highly risky, therefore speculators often use spread trades. For example, they might purchase one T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract with a long maturity date and simultaneously sell another T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) with a short maturity date. This provides possible speculative profts but also reduces risk compared with an outright long or short position in T-bonds.  

# 13.1 CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS  

T-bond [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) written on a number of government bonds are traded on several exchanges. The most liquid contracts are on US T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) (CBOT) quoted in US dollars. There are also Euro-Bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) – for example, on French and German bonds (‘Bunds’) which are both quoted in euros, and also [UK Gilt futures](.md) (quoted in sterling) – all traded on NYSE-Euronext. Somewhat less liquid T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) are those on Japanese government bonds, traded on NYSE-Euronext and in Tokyo.  

# 13.1.1 UK Long Gilt Futures Contract  

Details of the UK Long Gilt Future (on NYSE-EURONEXT) are given in Table 13.1. The bond deliverable in the contract is a ‘notional bond’ with a $4\%$ coupon (with a maturity between 8.75 and 13 years). Surprisingly, this notional $4\%$ bond does not actually exist! However, as we shall see, it provides a benchmark from which to calculate the price of possible bonds for delivery (which do exist).

In fact, the seller will select a bond which is known as the ‘[cheapest-to-deliver](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md)’ (CTD). The CTD bond can be shown to depend on the ‘conversion factor’ (CF) for each possible deliverable bond. (These concepts are explained below.)  

The [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract size is for delivery of $z=\pm100,000$ (face value) T-bonds and [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) quotes are expressed per £100 nominal (of deliverable T-bonds). The tick size is £0.01 per £100 nominal (e.g. 1-tick is a move from £95 to £95.01) – hence the tick value is £10 per contract $(=\pm0.01\times\mathrm{{\&100,000/\mathrm{{f100}}}})$ .  

# EXAMPLE 13.1  

# Face Value of Futures Contract  

On 27 July the September-[futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) has a closing (settlement) price quote of $F_{0}=£103.19$ per £100 nominal. Hence the ‘face value’1 of one [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is:  
$$
V_{F}=(\mathbb{\S}100,000)(F_{0}/100)=\mathbb{\P}103,190.
$$  

13.1.2 US ‘Classic’ and ‘Ultra’ T-bond [Futures Contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md)  

The principles underlying these [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) (traded on the CBOT) are very similar to those for the UK gilt-[futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract, except [price quotes](Chapter%2011%20-%20Interest%20Rate%20Futures.md) are in $1/32\mathrm{nd}$ of $1\%$ (see Table 13.2). Expiration months are March, June, September, and December. The last trading day is the business day prior to the last 7 days of the expiry month. The frst delivery day is the 1st business day of the [delivery month](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/One-Month%20SOFR%20Futures.md) but delivery can take place on any business day in the [delivery month](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/One-Month%20SOFR%20Futures.md).  

Note that the notional bond deliverable in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is assumed to be a $6\%$ -coupon bond. However, in practice the person with a ‘short’ [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position can choose from around 30 di!erent eligible bonds to deliver (which have coupons di!erent from $6\%$ and the CF adjusts the delivery price to refect the type of bonds actually delivered).  

For the ‘classic’ [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract the T-bonds delivered must have at least 15 years to maturity2 and less than 25 years to maturity (from the frst day of the [delivery month](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/One-Month%20SOFR%20Futures.md)).3 There are also [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) on 2, 5 and 10-year T-notes, which only di!er from the T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract in the maturity of the T-notes which can be delivered in the contract. As with most [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md), delivery rarely takes place but it is the possibility of delivery and hence [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) profts which keeps the T-bond [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) in line with the spot/cash market price of T-bonds.

# EXAMPLE 13.2  

# Tick Value of Futures Contract  

On 7 July, the US T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) settlement price quote (CBOT) for September delivery is ‘98-14’ $(=98+14/32)$ which corresponds to a price of $F_{0}=\$98.4375$ per $\$100$ nominal. With a contract size of $\$100,000$ , the face value of one contract (‘invoice’ or ‘contract’ price) is $V_{F}=\mathbb{5}100,000(F_{0}/100)=\mathbb{5}98,437.50.$ The tick size is $1/32$ of $1\%$ $(=0.0003125)$ which on a contract size of $\$100,000$ nominal, implies a tick value of $\$31.25$ per contract.  

# 13.2 CONVERSION FACTOR AND CHEAPEST-TO-DELIVER  

Before discussing [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) strategies we need to be clear about the use of the conversion factor (CF) and the concept of the [cheapest-to-deliver](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md) (CTD) bond. We do so with respect to the US T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract but similar principles apply to [UK Gilt futures](.md). There are a wide variety of bonds with over 15 years to maturity which can be delivered by the investor who is short T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). These will have di!erent maturities and [coupon payments](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) and hence di!erent values for CF and the CTD.

# 13.2.1 Conversion Factor (CF)  

This section assumes the reader is largely familiar with the [pricing](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) of bonds in the spot market and the conventions used in calculating [accrued interest](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md) (see Cuthbertson and Nitzsche 2008). The CF adjusts the price of the actual bond to be delivered, by assuming it has a $6\%$ yield, which makes it equivalent to the notional $6\%$ bond in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract.  

When computing the CF the maturity of the underlying bond is defned as the maturity on the frst day of the [delivery month](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/One-Month%20SOFR%20Futures.md). For example, if we assume the actual delivery date is 11 September 2018 and the underlying bond matures on 15 February 2038, then the maturity period used in the calculation of CF is 1 September (i.e. not 11 September) to 15 February 2038.  

The CF is best understood using a specifc example. To simplify matters we assume the counterparty who is short the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract does not yet hold a bond for delivery, so we are going to calculate the CF and CTD bond at the maturity date of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract $(=T)$ .  

Consider an actual 20-year US T-bond, paying semi-annual coupons of $8\%$ (i.e. $\$4$ per 6 months), with $n=40$ (6-month) periods to maturity (see Example 13.3). If the yield to maturity on this $8\%$ -coupon bond is assumed to be $6\%$ p.a. then its ‘fair’ or ‘theoretical’ price would be $\$123.1$ (per $\$100$ nominal) which gives a conversion factor $C F_{T}=\mathfrak{H}1.231$ . In essence the deliverable bond (with an $8\%$ coupon) is worth 1.231 times as much as the notional $6\%$ coupon bond (trading at par and hence with $Y T M=6\%$ ).  

# EXAMPLE 13.3  

# Calculation of Conversion Factor  

Bond for delivery is an $8\%$ -coupon T-bond with remaining maturity of 20 years (semi-annual coupons). What is the conversion factor of the bond?  

(continued)  

(continued)  

The theoretical price of an $8\%$ -coupon bond, with $\$100$ face value, if the YTM is assumed to be $6\%$ (i.e. the same as the notional bond in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract) is:  
$$
{\widehat{P}}={\frac{\S4}{(1.03)}}+{\frac{\S4}{(1.03)^{2}}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+{\frac{\S4}{(1.03)^{40}}}+{\frac{\S100}{(1.03)^{40}}}
$$  

Using the annuity formula for the present value of the coupons:  
$$
\widehat{P}=23.11(\S4)+0.3066(\S100)=\S123.1
$$  

The theoretical price of the actual $8\%$ -coupon bond to be delivered is $\widehat{P}=123.1$ and hence the conversion factor $C F=1.231$ (per $\$100$ nominal).  

The conversion factor adjusts the price of the actual bond to be delivered, relative to the notional $6\%$ coupon bond in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract:  

If coupon on the bond actually delivered $>6\%$ then $\mathrm{:}\Rightarrow C F>1$  

If coupon on the bond actually delivered $<6\%$ then $\iota\Rightarrow C F<1$  

The conversion factor will di!er for bonds with di!erent [coupon payments](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) and di!erent maturities. The CF for any specifc deliverable bond will change over time simply because the maturity date of the deliverable bond gets closer (although it will always exceed 15 years, otherwise it will cease to be an eligible bond). In calculating the CF the CBOT assumes the yield curve is fat at $6\%$ . But in practice this is rarely (if ever) the case. This means that the ‘true price’ of the deliverable bond, which should be priced using spot rates (see Cuthbertson and Nitzsche 2008) will not equal that used in the calculation of the CF. Hence, there will usually be eligible bonds for delivery that are actually cheaper than the ‘cheapest-todeliver’ bond.  

Let us now consider the cash amount received by a trader (Ms Short) who is short T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), when she delivers the underlying bond at maturity $T$ . Let $F_{T}$ be the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) settlement price (on the ‘position day’ – see below). When Ms Short delivers the $8\%$ -coupon, 20 year bond she will receive:  

Ms Short’s receipts at settlement  

Note that $F_{T}$ is the ‘settlement price’ at $T$ (and not the price initially agreed at the outset of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract). ${A I}_{T}$ is the [accrued interest](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md) at $T$ and is a fraction of the next coupon payment on the bond delivered against the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract. For example, if the maturity date $T$ of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) is 11 September 2017 and the deliverable bond matures on 15 February 2038, then the deliverable bond has semi-annual coupons each year on 15 February and 15 August. Assume there are 184 days between 15 August and 15 February. The short therefore delivers a bond at $T=11$ September 2017, which already has 27 days of [accrued interest](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md). Hence the long must pay the short for this loss of [accrued interest](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md) of $A I_{T}=\S0.73[=(27/184)\times10/2]$ .  

# 13.2.2 Cheapest-to-Deliver  

Suppose it is now $T$ ${\bf\tau}=11$ September 2017) and there are three bonds designated by CBOT for actual delivery in September whose CF are 1.044, 1.033, and 1.065. In practice, the calculation of the CTD bond is quite complex but a rough idea of the CTD bond can be obtained by choosing that bond with the smallest raw basis:  
$$
R a w b a s i s=B_{T}-F_{T}C F_{T}
$$  

where $B_{T}$ is the spot (‘clean’) price an eligible bond for delivery, $F_{T}$ is the settlement [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) and ${C F}_{T}$ is the conversion factor of a deliverable bond.  

Table 13.3 shows the calculation of the raw basis for three deliverable bonds. The fnal column indicates that Bond-C is the CTD. Although it is often the case that the bond actually delivered by the short is the CTD, nevertheless this is not always so since the seller may wish to preserve the [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of her own bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) or provide a bond, other than the CTD, in order to minimise her tax bill. We now examine how Equation (13.1) for the raw basis arises. At settlement the short receives:  
$$
C a s h r e c e i v e d b y s h o r t\left(p e r\:\mathcal{S}100\:n o m i n a l\right)=F_{T}C F_{T}+A I_{T}
$$  

where $A I_{T}$ is the [accrued interest](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md). The conversion factor adjusts the T-bond [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) for the fact that the deliverable bond has a coupon di!erent from the notional $6\%$ bond (stated in the T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract). The $8\%$ -coupon bond actually delivered would have a higher price when its coupons are discounted at the notional $6\%$ . To purchase the actual deliverable bond in the cash market, the short will pay:  
$$
C a s h p a i d b y s h o r t={"C l e a n P r i c e^{\prime}}+A c c r u e d I n t e r e s t=B_{T}+A I_{T}
$$  

Hence, the net cost to the short of providing the deliverable $8\%$ -coupon bond is just the raw basis defned above:  
$$
N e t c o s t=(B_{T}+A I_{T})-(F_{T}C F_{T}+A I_{T})=B_{T}-F_{T}C F_{T}
$$

Suppose [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) rise between 1 May and 1 August (Table 13.4B).

# 13.4 HEDGING: FURTHER ISSUES  

# 13.4.1 Cross Hedge: Corporate Bond Portfolio  

Suppose company-XYZ is going to raise funds by issuing corporate bonds in 6 months’ time, after the legal details of the bond issue are completed. The treasurer of company-XYZ may be worried by the possibility of a rise in [long-term interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/The%20Economist%20Margin%20Call%20of%20the%20Wild.md) over the next 6 months, which will raise the cost of issuing corporate bonds.

Regression techniques can be used but results may be subject to error, as changes in corporate ‘specifc risk’ (e.g. IT failures, results of patent applications, environmental issues, default) will a!ect changes in the corporate bond yield $d y_{s}$ – whereas changes in $d y_{f}$ (government T-bond yields) should be largely una!ected by these ‘corporate risks’.  

# 13.4.2 PVBP, Convexity, and Perturbation Analysis  

Instead of using the [duration-based hedge ratio](Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedging%20with%20Interest%20Rate%20Futures.md) we could obtain the same result using the ‘price value of a basis point’ (PVBP). This requires the calculation of the PVBP for the cash-market bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) to be hedged and the PVBP for the US T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract. This method usually uses the [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) approximation for the change in T-bond prices and therefore assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve and small changes in [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).  

Alternatively, we can calculate the PVBP of the cash-market (spot) bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) using the ‘[duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) $+$ [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md)’ approximation (for a parallel shift in the spot yield curve of 1 bp):  
$$
d V_{s}=-V_{s}[(D_{s}d y_{s})+(1/2)\chi_{s}(d y_{s})^{2}]
$$  

where $\begin{array}{r}{\chi_{s}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}\chi_{i}}\end{array}$ is the cash-market [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md), $w_{i}=V_{i}/V_{s}$ proportion of the total bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) held in bond- $i$ and $\chi_{i}=$ [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of bond- $i$ .  

Alternatively, we can use the ‘full’ (present value) [pricing](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) formula when considering the e!ect of a large change in [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) on the ‘total’ change in the cash-market value of a T-bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) – this will implicitly incorporate the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of the bonds. The ‘full valuation’ method can be done for either parallel or non-parallel shifts in spot yields – as spot rates might change by di!erent amounts.  

# 13.4.2.1 Non-parallel Shifts  

We can also calculate the change in dollar value of one [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract, ${\bf d V}_{F}={\bf V}_{F}(d F/F)$ using $F_{t}=S_{t}e^{r(T-t)}-F V C_{T}$ where the change is calculated with respect to changes in the spot  

yields which determine (a) the price of the deliverable bond $S_{t}$ and (b) the (future) value of any [coupon payments](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) $F V C_{T}$ . The number of [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) in the hedge is then:  
$$
N_{F}=-\left(\frac{^{\ast}T o t a l^{\ast}c h a n g e i n\nu a l u e o f c a s h m a r k e t,b o n d p o r t f o l i o}{C h a n g e i n\nu a l u e o f o n e T\cdot b o n d,f u t u r e s c o n t r a c t}\right)
$$  

This is a form of perturbation analysis because we choose the size of the change in each spot interest rate along the yield curve and then calculate the impact on the numerator and denominator in Equation (13.9).  

# 13.4.3 Hedging the Market Risk of an Underpriced Corporate Bond  

In Chapter 6 we discussed how a hedge fund that buys [underpriced stocks](../Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%206%20-%20Strategies:%20Stock%20Index%20Futures.md) can hedge the [market risk](../Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%205%20-%20Index%20Futures.md) of the stocks by [shorting](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Short%20Selling.md) [stock index futures](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md). Consider a similar situation where Ms Bond today, buys what she believes are underpriced corporate bonds (of several companies). She might believe the corporate bonds are underpriced because the rating agencies (and the average bond trader) have given the bond an A-rating but her assessment of their [default risk](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md) would suggest a higher AA-rating.  

She therefore expects a rise in the market price of the bond (even if risk-free government bond yields stay constant), as ‘market participants’ come to realise that the corporate bond is actually less risky than they frst thought. Then she can close out her long corporate bond position at a proft.  

However, Ms Bond is exposed to changes in long-term (risk-free) T-bond yields. If long-term risk-free yields increase, this will cause a fall in the cash market price of her corporate bonds, which may more than o!set the gains she makes when the ‘[credit risk](../../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) underpricing’ is corrected. To hedge against future changes in T-bond yields, Ms Bond should short $N_{F}$ , T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), today:  
$$
N_{F}=-\left({\frac{V_{p}}{V_{F}}}\right)\left({\frac{D_{s}}{D_{f}}}\right)\beta_{y}C F
$$  

where $V_{p}$ is the total dollar amount held in her [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of underpriced cash-market corporate bonds which have a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of $D_{s}$ . If the risk-free T-bond rate increases, then the T-bond [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) will fall and the proft after closing out the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) will just compensate for any loss in value of the cash-market bond position – solely due to changes in risk-free T-bond yields.  

Ms Bond can then capture any future rise in corporate bond prices due to the correction of the ‘[credit risk](../../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md)’ mispricing. However, her [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of underpriced corporate bonds is still subject to any (residual) ‘specifc risk’ (e.g. bankruptcy, regulatory changes, IT failures, reputational damage, etc.) of the bond issuers. The hedge using T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) does not protect the ‘mispriced’ corporate bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) from specifc risks – but overall, specifc risk may be small in a well-diversifed corporate bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).  

# 13.4.3.1 Long-Short Bond Portfolio  

As in the case of underpriced and overpriced stocks, a bond trader might take a [long position](../Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%204%20-%20Futures:%20Hedging%20and%20Speculation.md) in ‘underpriced’ corporate bonds and short-sell ‘overpriced’ corporate bonds.5 The dollar amount of cash-market bonds held long $V_{L}>0$ or short $(V_{S}<0)$ , determine the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) durations $D_{L},D_{S}$ and hence the number of T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) to go long and short, using Equation (13.10). The net position in [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) depends on the sign of $N_{L}-N_{S}$ , but this ensures the long-short bond speculator is then hedged against parallel shifts in the yield curve, while she waits for the mispricing of the cash-market bonds to be corrected.  

# 13.4.4 Risks in the Hedge  

A hedged bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) will not provide a perfect hedge because:  

• the hedge period (e.g. 3 months from May to August) may not match the maturity date of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract (e.g. September contract) – this gives rise to [basis risk](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md).   
• calculating price changes in [futures markets](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md) are subject to error, in part because it is di\$cult to ascertain the CTD bond (and hence its [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)).   
• shifts in the yield curve may not be parallel (there may be twists in the yield curve), so we cannot always assume [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) or [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) plus [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) provides a good approximation to changes in T-bond cash-market prices.   
• If we are [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) a corporate bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) then the change in the value of the corporate bonds due to changes in risk-free T-bond yields can be hedged using T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) but changes in corporate bond prices due to any change in (residual) specifc/[credit risk](../../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) will not be hedged.  

However, academic studies fnd that [hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) using T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) can [reduce price risk](../Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%204%20-%20Futures:%20Hedging%20and%20Speculation.md), with the [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) based [hedge ratio](../Part%20VI%20-%20The%20Greeks/Chapter%2027%20-%20Delta%20Hedging.md) performing particularly well. [Hedging](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) cash-market positions in corporate bonds using T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) is also found to be e!ective, even though this is a cross-hedge and involves possible changes in [credit risk](../../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md).  

# 13.5 MARKET TIMING  

Suppose a trader Ms Bond currently holds a bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and over the next month she expects [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) to fall sharply. Today, to take advantage of this interest rate forecast she might move out of low [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) bonds and into high [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) bonds, because the latter will rise in price more than the former. However, this is likely to be costly because it involves ‘high’ transaction costs of selling low [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) bonds and buying high [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) bonds – and then reversing these trades in one month’s time (when she [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) to her ‘normal long-run’ position in bonds).  

A less costly strategy is to continue to hold the original cash market bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and alter the e!ective [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) using T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). Suppose, $D_{S}=$ [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of Ms Bond’s cash-market T-bonds, $D_{f}=$ [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the T-bond deliverable in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract and $D_{d}=\operatorname{Ms}$ Bond’s target (desired) [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md). The number of [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) required to achieve a desired [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) $D_{d}$ is (see Appendix 13.A):  
$$
N_{F}=\left(\frac{D_{d}-D_{s}}{D_{f}}\right)\left(\frac{V_{s}}{V_{F}}\right)\beta_{y}
$$  

where we usually assume that $d y_{s}=d y_{f}$ and hence $\beta_{y}=1$ .6 The formula for $N_{F}$ can be used in a market timing strategy. Suppose you are long a cash-market bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) (so $V_{s}$ and $D_{s}$ are positive) then:  

• If you expect a rise in yields (i.e. fall in bond prices) and therefore require a lower desired [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) $D_{d}<D_{s}$ , then today, sell $N_{F}$ T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md).   
• If you expect a fall in yields (i.e. rise in bond prices) and therefore require a higher desired [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) $D_{d}>D_{s}$ , then today, buy $N_{F}$ T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md).  

# 13.6 WILD CARD PLAY  

There is another practical issue to discuss as regards the US T-bond [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) and that is the strategy known as Wild Card Play. On the CBOT, trading in T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) ceases at 3 p.m. (EST) while actual T-bonds are traded until 5 p.m. (EST) and the ‘short’ in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract has until early evening to issue the clearing house with notice of intention to deliver. If the notice is issued, the [invoice price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%201/Accrued%20Interest.md) of the T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) is calculated on the basis of the settlement price (i.e. average of quoted prices just before the close of trading). However, the short can wait and see if she can purchase an eligible bond for delivery, at a lower price in the cash market. To see how this is possible we have to closely examine the delivery process for T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). Delivery is a 3-day process and involves:  

(i) Position Day: The short notifes the clearing house of intention to deliver, two business days later.   
(ii) Notice of Intention Day: The clearing house assigns a trader who is long, to accept delivery. The short is now obligated to deliver the next business day.  

(iii) Delivery Day:  

Bonds are delivered (with the last possible delivery day being the business day prior to the last 7 days in the [delivery month](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/One-Month%20SOFR%20Futures.md)).  

This delivery process can give rise to a Wild Card Play by the short on any ‘position day’. If the cash-market price of bonds falls between $3\ \mathrm{p.m}$ . and ${\mathsf{s p.m}}.$ ., the short buys the ‘low price’ CTD bond in the cash market and issues a notice of intention to deliver, knowing that on delivery she will receive the ‘high’ [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) settlement price determined as of $3\ \mathrm{p.m}$ . that day. However, if the bond price does not decline, she can wait until the next day and repeat this strategy (until the fnal business day before the fnal delivery day in the month). In essence, the short has an implicit option that can be exercised during the [delivery month](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/One-Month%20SOFR%20Futures.md), while the long has increased risk because she does not know the exact bond that will be delivered.  

There is also a quality or switching option for the short, since she can deliver a variety of eligible bonds. Even if she holds a specifc bond against delivery on her short [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position, nevertheless if the yield curve shifts she may choose to deliver another yet cheaper bond. The timing option applies when the bond held for delivery by the short pays a coupon (rate) that exceeds the cost of fnancing her cash-market bond position (i.e. the repo rate). Then it is better if the short delays delivery. There is also an end of the month option held by the short, since the last trading day for the T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is the eighth-to-last business day. The [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) settlement price is fxed in over this period, but the short still has the option to announce her intention to deliver on any day up to the penultimate business day. She can therefore wait to see if cash-market bond prices fall over this period and deliver a ‘low’ price bond if one becomes available.  

All of these embedded options available to the person holding a short T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position should lead to a lower [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) – in order to compensate the long, for the increased risk. But it is thought that most of the time these options do not distort the [cash-and-carry arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Dollar%20Rolls.md) relationship. However, these embedded options for the short do make it more diffcult to accurately calculate both the optimal [hedge ratio](../Part%20VI%20-%20The%20Greeks/Chapter%2027%20-%20Delta%20Hedging.md) and the [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) based on the [cash-and-carry](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md) approach.

The [underlying asset](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) to be delivered at maturity $T$ is a single zero-coupon bond.

As we saw in Chapter 3 if we ignore some important practical issues, the fair price (at $t$ ) of a T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract using [cash-and-carry arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Dollar%20Rolls.md) is:  
$$
F_{t}=[S_{t}-P V(C)]e^{r(T-t)},
$$  

where $s$ is the [invoice price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%201/Accrued%20Interest.md) of the cash-market bond (i.e. the ‘clean price’ plus [accrued interest](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md)), $P V(C)$ is the present value of any [coupon payments](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) (on the deliverable bond) between today and the maturity date $T$ of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract and $r$ is the (continuously compounded) spot yield (for maturity $T-t)$ . Note that the T-bond [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) can also be written $F_{t}=\bar{S}_{t}e^{r(T-t)}-F V C_{T}$ , where the future value at $T$ of the [coupon payments](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) is $F V C_{T}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}C_{i}e^{r_{i}(T-t_{i})}.$ .  

Unfor=tunately, in practice it is di\$cult to accurately calculate the fair T-bond futures price. This is because of the fexibility of the short’s decision over the delivery date $T$ and the precise choice of the CTD bond and hence its invoice price $s$ .  

First, note that the cost of creating a synthetic [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is the cost of buying the underlying cash-market bond at $S_{t}$ using borrowed funds, which accrues to a debt of $S_{t}e^{r(T-t)}$ at maturity $T$ (of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract). The cost-of-carry is o!set by the $N$ coupons $C_{i}$ received from the cash-market bond at times $t_{i}$ from today. When these coupons are reinvested at the (expected) risk-free rates $r_{i}$ (between $t_{i}$ and $T$ ) they have a future value at $T$ of:  
$$
F V C_{T}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}C_{i}e^{r_{i}(T-t_{i})}
$$  

The [no-arbitrage futures price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Part%20II-Basis%20Trading%20and%20the%20Implied%20Repo%20Rate.md) is then:  
$$
F_{t}=S_{t}e^{r(T-t)}-F V C_{T}

where $r$ is the interest rate over the period $(t,T)$ . Considering the additional complexities of the conversion factor, [accrued interest](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md) etc., the [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) for a contract which matures at $T$

$$  

Let’s examine this from a more practical point of view, which requires some additional points to be made. Suppose it is 1 July 2017. The yield curve is fat and $r=0.03$ $3\%$ p.a., continuously compounded). You are deciding whether [cash-and-carry arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Dollar%20Rolls.md) is possible with the September T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract, which has a known maturity date $T=11$ September (Figure 13.1).  

By buying a cash-market T-bond on 1 July and carrying it forward to 11 September, you create a synthetic T- bond future, since the T-bond can be delivered against the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract. Assume the CTD bond is a $10\%$ -coupon T-bond which pays semi-annual coupons of $\$5$ each year, on 15 August and 15 February and matures on 15 February 2038. It has a CF of 1.22.  

Today at $t=1$ July to the maturity of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), the deliverable bond pays one coupon of $C=\$5$ on 15 August, which when invested over 27 days is expected to accrue to a future value at time $T$ of:  
$$
F V C_{T}=5e^{0.03(27/184)}=\S5.022.
$$  

On 1 July, borrowing at the risk-free (repo rate) $r$ and purchasing the bond in the cash market for an [invoice price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%201/Accrued%20Interest.md) $S_{t}$ , leads to an amount owing at $T=11$ September, of $S_{t}e^{r(T-t)}$ (i.e. purchase cost plus the repo interest cost). Therefore at $T$ , the net cost-of-carry in the cash market is:  

But the above strategy creates a synthetic T-bond future since it ensures that the bond purchased in the cash market on 1 July is available for delivery against the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract at

$A I_{T}=\$0.73$ is the accrued interest (between 15 August and $T=11$ September) on the CTD bond delivered at $T$ (see Figure 13.1). $A I_{T}$ is a proportion of the next coupon which accrues on 15 February 2018.  

Since the actual [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract and the synthetic [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) both deliver one bond at $T$ then the cost today must be equal, otherwise risk-free [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) profts would be possible.

Hence the net (cash-market) cost at $T$ is $S_{t}e^{r(T-t)}-F V C_{T}$ , but the arbitrageur receives a larger amount $I P F_{T}$ . This [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) creates additional demand for cash-market bonds so $S_{t}$ increases and sales of bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) will reduce $F_{t}$ until the equality in (13.17) is restored and the equilibrium [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) is given by Equation (13.18).  

However, the [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) strategy is not completely risk-free because the [coupon payments](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) received from the cash market T-bond have to be re-invested at [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) which are unknown at $t=0$ (1 July). At $t$ , the best guess of the reinvestment rate for any coupon receipts would be the implied [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) – and to lock in this rate would require a strip of FRAs. Hence [cash-and-carry arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Dollar%20Rolls.md) only provides an approximate formula for the T-bond [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md).

Assume the clean price of the deliverable bond on 1 July is $B_{t}=101$ . The [accrued interest](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md) from 15 February 2017 to 1 July 2017 (Figure 13.1) is $A I_{t}=(136~\mathrm{days}/181~\mathrm{days})\&5={\&}3.76.$ The cash-market bond price is:

# 13.8 T-BOND FUTURES SPREADS  

A spread is a [long position](../Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%204%20-%20Futures:%20Hedging%20and%20Speculation.md) in one asset and a short position in another (similar) asset. A T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) spread can be used to speculate on twists or parallel shifts in the yield curve. For example, a trader Ms Bond could undertake a spread trade by buying a T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) (which delivers a bond with at least 15 years to maturity) and simultaneously selling a 10-year T-bond in the cash market (i.e. which has a di!erent maturity/[duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) to the CTD bond in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)). She might then proft after a change in [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) as the [futures price and cash](../../Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Part%20III-The%20Fundamentals%20of%20Basis%20Trading.md)-market prices change by di!erent amounts (because their underlying durations are di!erent). For example, if all [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) fall by $1\%$ she would gain more on the long [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) than she loses on the short bond position, because the [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) is higher than the [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the cash-market bond.  

A spread trade is less risky than holding just a naked [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position – although potential profts are also less. However, such a strategy would have to take account of [margin requirements](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Case%20Study%20Mf%20Globals%20Repo-To-Maturity%20Trades.md) and any ‘haircuts’ on short-sales of bonds in the cash market. A spread trade may be less costly if two [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) are used, with di!erent maturities.

We then ‘carry’ this cash market bond until 1 September when it is delivered against the short September-[futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position and we receive $F_{T_{2}}$ (plus any [accrued interest](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md) $A I_{T_{2}}$ , arising from the underlying bond’s next coupon payment on 1 February 2018).

If the [implied repo rate](../../Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/The%20Futures%20Bond%20Basis:%20government%20bond%20futures%20and%20basis%20%20trading.md) $\widehat{r}=4.3\%$ (say) exceeds the cost of borrowing at the actual forward repo rate $f=4.16\%$ (applicable between 1 June and 1 September), then a long [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) spread trade undertaken on 1 April is guaranteed to be proftable.  

The actual repo borrowing rate is the [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) $f=4.16\%$ , when viewed from $t=0$ (1 April 2017). How can we ‘lock-in’ this [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) on 1 April? Today we sell Ju=ne-[Eurodollar futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Convexity-Adjusted%20Models%20for%20LIBOR%20Forwards%20Qu.md) contracts at $F_{T_{1}}^{E u r o\Phi}=\mathfrak{H}99.$ . When we close out the [Eurodollar futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Convexity-Adjusted%20Models%20for%20LIBOR%20Forwards%20Qu.md) in June, the e!ective cost (between June and September) is the implied [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) $f=4.16\%(=100/99)^{365/90}-1)$ .10 You use the cash infow on 1 June from closing out several short [Eurodollar futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Convexity-Adjusted%20Models%20for%20LIBOR%20Forwards%20Qu.md) contracts, to pay $F_{T_{1}}$ (plus [accrued interest](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md)) for delivery of the eligible T-bond in the maturing June T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). Hence if the implied (forward) repo rate from buying the spread is $\widehat{\boldsymbol{r}}$ $(=4.5\%)$ and the cost of borrowing is $f$ $(=4.16\%$ , the actual forward repo rate), we undertake the following turtle trade on 1 April:  

# Turtle trade  

Buy the T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) spread and sell June-[Eurodollar futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Convexity-Adjusted%20Models%20for%20LIBOR%20Forwards%20Qu.md).  

When the [implied repo rate](../../Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/The%20Futures%20Bond%20Basis:%20government%20bond%20futures%20and%20basis%20%20trading.md) (i.e. the ‘percentage return’ on the T-bond spread trade) exceeds the actual (forward) repo cost of borrowing, an overall proft will be made on the turtle trade.  

# 13.8.1.2 Selling the Spread  

Suppose we have the reverse position on 1 April, namely the [implied repo rate](../../Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/The%20Futures%20Bond%20Basis:%20government%20bond%20futures%20and%20basis%20%20trading.md) $\widehat{r}=4.5\%<f=$ $4.8\%$ , the actual (forward) repo rate. Then you sell the T-Bond spread, so on 1 April:  

(a) sell the June T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)   
(b) buy the September T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) and   
(c) you lend money at the forward repo rate $f=4.16\%$ (applicable between June and September) by buying the June [Eurodollar futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Convexity-Adjusted%20Models%20for%20LIBOR%20Forwards%20Qu.md) on 1 April.  

Selling the June T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) and buying the September T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) is equivalent to borrowing at the [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) $\widehat{r}=4.5\%$ . By buying the [Eurodollar futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Convexity-Adjusted%20Models%20for%20LIBOR%20Forwards%20Qu.md) is equivalent to lending at $f=4.8\%$ . Hence the trade results in an [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) proft of $0.3\%$ .  

The above strategy is an intermarket spread since it involves two T-bond [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) which mature at di!erent dates but are on the same [underlying asset](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) (i.e. a cash-market T-bond). They are not risk-free trades because of the di\$culty of ascertaining the CTD bond in each contract and uncertainty surrounding the reinvestment rate of any coupons paid.

# APPENDIX 13.A: HEDGING: DURATION AND MARKET TIMING  

First (for illustrative purposes), consider a cash-market (spot) position in two bonds, where $S_{i}$ $\mathbf{\Sigma}=$ (invoice) price of bond- $\cdot i$ and $N_{i}=$ number of bonds- $\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{\vec{l}}$ held $\mathrm{\Delta}N_{i}>0$ if held long or $N_{i}<0$ if short-sold). The dollar value and change in the cash-market T-bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is:  

Cash Market  
$$
\begin{array}{c}{{V_{s}=N_{1}S_{1}+N_{2}S_{2}}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{d V_{s}=V_{1}(d S_{1}/S_{1})+V_{2}(d S_{2}/S_{2})=-[V_{1}(D_{1}d y_{1})+V_{2}(D_{2}d y_{2})]}}\end{array}
$$  

where we use the [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) approximation, $d S_{i}/S_{i}=-D_{i}d y_{i}$ . For a parallel shift in spot yields $d y_{1}=d y_{2}=d y_{s}$ , then:  
$$
d V_{s}=-V_{s}(D_{s}d y_{s})
$$  

where $V_{s}\equiv V_{1}+V_{2}$ , $w_{i}=V_{i}/V_{s}$ for $i=1,2$ and $D_{S}\equiv w_{1}D_{1}+w_{2}D_{2}$ is the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the cash-market bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).

The change in value of a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) consisting of ‘cash-market T-bonds $+\mathrm{T}$ -bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)’ (ignoring [accrued interest](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md)) is:  
$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{d V=d V_{s}+N_{F}\ z\ (d F/100)=V_{s}(D_{s}d y_{s})+N_{F}V_{F}(d F/F)}\\ &{\quad\quad=-[V_{s}(D_{s}d y_{s})+N_{F}V_{F}(D_{f}d y_{f})]}\end{array}
$$  

Assume the relationship between the change in the YTM of the cash-market T-bonds and the change in the yield (on the deliverable bond) in the T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is $d y_{s}=\beta_{y}d y_{f}$ , then:  
$$
d V=-[V_{s}D_{s}\beta_{y}+N_{F}V_{F}D_{f}]d y_{f}

To fully hedge your cash-market T-bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) we set $d V=0$ , hence:  
$$
N_{F}=-\left(\frac{V_{s}}{V_{F}}\right)\left(\frac{D_{s}}{D_{f}}\right)\beta_{y}
$$  

which is sometimes referred to as the minimum variance [hedge ratio](../Part%20VI%20-%20The%20Greeks/Chapter%2027%20-%20Delta%20Hedging.md).  

# Effective Duration and Market Timing  

Suppose a trader holds a cash-market (spot) T-bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and she wants to change the e!ective [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) to some desired level $D_{d}$ , using T-bond [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md). The desired change $d V_{d}$ in her cash-market T-bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is:  
$$
d V_{d}=-V_{s}D_{d}d y_{s}=-V_{s}D_{d}(\beta_{y}d y_{f})
$$  

Equating (13.A.5) and (13.A.7):11  
$$
N_{F}=\left(\frac{V_{s}}{V_{F}}\right)\left(\frac{D_{d}-D_{s}}{D_{f}}\right)\beta_{y}
$$  

The cash-market T-bond position could be either net long or short – depending on the sign of $V_{s}\equiv V_{1}+V_{2}$ – and the cash-market [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) could be positive or negative depending on the value of $D_{s}$ . For the moment assume $V_{s}$ and $D_{s}$ are both positive. Then (13.A.8) gives the required number of [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) to achieve a ‘desired [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)’:  
$$
\begin{array}{r}{\begin{array}{r l}{\mathrm{If}D_{d}>D_{s}\quad\Rightarrow\quad}&{\mathrm{take~a~long~position~in~T\mathrm{-}b o n d~f u t u r e s,}}\\ {\mathrm{If}D_{d}<D_{s}\quad\Rightarrow\quad}&{\mathrm{take~a~short~position~in~T\mathrm{-}b o n d~f u t u r e s.}}\end{array}}\end{array}

Hence, to increase (decrease) the e!ective [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of an underlying (long) cash-market bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) (with $D_{s}>0\}$ ), we go long (short) T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). This makes sense because if [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) subsequently fall, then you make profts both from the cash market bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and the long T-bond [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) – this is equivalent to increasing the [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the cash-market bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and is a form of ‘market timing’. If your forecasts are correct then you will make more proft by taking the long [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position rather than just holding your cash-market bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).  

Note that (13.A.6) the minimum variance [hedge ratio](../Part%20VI%20-%20The%20Greeks/Chapter%2027%20-%20Delta%20Hedging.md) is a special case of (13.A.8), where the desired [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md), $D_{d}=0$ :

# APPENDIX 13.B: IMPLIED REPO RATE AND ARBITRAGE  

The [implied repo rate](../../Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/The%20Futures%20Bond%20Basis:%20government%20bond%20futures%20and%20basis%20%20trading.md) is another way of determining whether risk-free [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) profts are possible. The [implied repo rate](../../Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/The%20Futures%20Bond%20Basis:%20government%20bond%20futures%20and%20basis%20%20trading.md) is the return from buying the underlying cash-market T-bond at $t=0$ for the [invoice price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%201/Accrued%20Interest.md) $S_{0}=\left(B_{0}+A I_{0}\right)$ and simultaneously selling the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) for delivery at $T$ . The return or [implied repo rate](../../Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/The%20Futures%20Bond%20Basis:%20government%20bond%20futures%20and%20basis%20%20trading.md) $\widehat{\boldsymbol{r}}$ (using discrete compounding) is:  
$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{1+\widehat{r}=\bigg(\frac{c a s h r e c e i\nu e d a t T f r o m h e d g e p o r t f o l i o}{c a s h p a i d o u t a t t=0f o r t h e u n d e r l y i n g b o n d}\bigg)^{1}\bigg/_{T}}\\ &{\qquad=\bigg(\frac{F_{0,T}C F_{0}+A I_{T}+F V C_{T}}{S_{0}}\bigg)^{1}\bigg/_{T}}\end{array}
$$  

where $F_{0,T}=$ [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) set at $t=0$ for payment at $T$ (when the underlying bond is delivered) and the conversion factor is $C F_{0}$ . The arbitrageur holds the underlying bond and receives [coupon payments](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) which can be reinvested over the period $t=0$ to $T$ to give a future value $F V C_{T}$ . The [accrued interest](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md) on the deliverable bond at maturity of the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is $A I_{T}$ . The cash-market bond has an [invoice price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%201/Accrued%20Interest.md) of $S_{0}$ and this is fnanced by borrowing at the (actual) repo rate $r$ , at $t=0$ .  

[Cash-and-carry arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Dollar%20Rolls.md) is proftable if the [implied repo rate](../../Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/The%20Futures%20Bond%20Basis:%20government%20bond%20futures%20and%20basis%20%20trading.md) $\widehat{r}>$ actual repo rate r  

It is easy to see using (13.B.1) that if $\widehat{r}>r$ then:  
$$
\frac{F_{0,T}C F_{0}+A I_{T}+F V C_{T}}{S_{0}}>(1+r)^{T}
$$  

Part of the reason for using the [implied repo rate](../../Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/The%20Futures%20Bond%20Basis:%20government%20bond%20futures%20and%20basis%20%20trading.md) to determine possible [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) profits is that it is straightforward to compare the [implied repo rate](../../Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/The%20Futures%20Bond%20Basis:%20government%20bond%20futures%20and%20basis%20%20trading.md) with the quoted repo rate  

(cost of borrowing funds). Using (13.B.2), the elimination of any [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) profts implies the fair (no-[arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md)) T-bond [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) is:  
$$
F_{0,T}=(1/C F_{0})[S_{0}(1+r)^{T}-F V C_{T}-A I_{T}]
$$  

If we replace the discrete compound rate $(1+r)^{T}$ by the [continuously compounded rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Arithmetic%20and%20Geometric%20Rates%20of%20Return.md) $e^{r T}$ then Equation (13.B.3) is equivalent to the formula for the ‘no-[arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md)’ or ‘fair price’ given by Equation (13.14) in the text.  

# EXERCISES  

# Question 1  

Explain whether you would undertake a long or short [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) hedge if you plan to purchase a cash-market T-bond in 30 days’ time and you want to hedge against adverse outcomes.  

# Question 2  

On 1 July you hold a bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of $\$100$ with duration of 7 (years). The December US T-bond futures price is 95-12 (‘95 and 12/32’). Contract size of the T-bond futures is $\$100,000$ .  

The [cheapest-to-deliver](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md) (CTD) bond has a [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of 9 years and a conversion factor of unity. On average, the change in the bond yield equals $90\%$ of the change in the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) yield.  

(a) How many T-bond [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) are needed to hedge your position over the next 2 months? (b) How can the [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of your bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) be reduced to 3 (years)?  

# Question 3  

How does the ‘wild card play’ help the person who holds a short position in a US T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract?  

# Question 4  

The current US, T-bond [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) is 101-12 ( 101-12/32). Which of the following three bonds is [cheapest-to-deliver](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md)?

# Question 5  

The average [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of your $\$10$ US bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), on 15 February is 8 years. The September T-bond [futures price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) is currently 110-16. The [cheapest-to-deliver](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md) ‘Note’ against the [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract has a [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of 7 years. How can you hedge against interest changes over the next 7 months? How many [futures contracts](../../Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) do you require? (Ignore the complexities of the conversion factor and [cheapest-to-deliver](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md) bond).  

# Question 6  

Intuitively, if you are long a bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) with [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) $\mathrm{D}=10$ years, how can T-bond [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) be used to give a lower e!ective [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)? Why might you want to lower the [duration](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of your cash-market bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)?
