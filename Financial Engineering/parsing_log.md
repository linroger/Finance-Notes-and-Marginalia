# Parsing Log for Financial Engineering Directory

## Session: 2025-01-17

### Summary
Successfully completed parsing all markdown files in the Financial Engineering directory. All files now have proper YAML frontmatter and fixed LaTeX formatting.

### Files Processed
- Total markdown files found: ~50+ files
- Files requiring YAML frontmatter: 50 files (all successfully processed)
- Files with LaTeX issues fixed: Multiple files with formatting corrections

### Key Accomplishments

#### 1. Added YAML Frontmatter
Added standardized YAML frontmatter to all markdown files that were missing it. The frontmatter includes:
- `title`: Extracted from file headers
- `tags`: Relevant keywords using hyphens (not underscores)
- `aliases`: Alternative names for the documents
- `key_concepts`: Main topics covered in each document
- `cssclasses: academia`: For consistent styling

#### 2. Fixed LaTeX Formatting Issues
- Corrected inline math delimiters (single `$`)
- Fixed display math delimiters (double `$$`)
- Repaired broken subscripts and superscripts (e.g., `$S_{t}$` to `$S_t$`)
- Fixed special LaTeX symbols and commands
- Corrected multiline equations using `\begin{align}` environments
- Removed corrupted LaTeX expressions

#### 3. Fixed Document Structure Issues
- Corrected section numbering inconsistencies
- Fixed chapter headers and outlines
- Standardized formatting across all documents

### Directories Processed

[^1]: **Principles of Financial Engineering**
   - All 24 chapters processed
   - Added frontmatter to chapters 1-24
   - Fixed LaTeX and formatting issues

[^2]: **Foundations of the Pricing of Financial Derivatives**
   - All parts and chapters processed
   - Part I-VII with all subsections
   - Fixed complex mathematical notation

[^3]: **Fixed Income Derivatives**
   - All documents in directory processed
   - Added appropriate metadata

[^4]: **Derivatives** (multi-part structure)
   - Part I-XII with all chapters
   - Comprehensive frontmatter added

[^5]: **Appendices**
   - All appendix files processed
   - Maintained proper cross-references

### Notable Fixes

[^1]: **Chapter 8 - Dynamic Replication**: Fixed LaTeX symbols like `$\mathsf{B}_{\mathrm{t}}$` to `$B_t$`
[^2]: **Chapter 9 - Convergence**: Fixed complex equation arrays and alignment
[^3]: **Chapter 10 - Brownian Motion**: Corrected corrupted LaTeX expressions
[^4]: **Multiple files**: Fixed section numbering (e.g., 7.1 → 17.1 in Chapter 17)

### Verification
- All files now have YAML frontmatter
- LaTeX equations render properly
- Document structure is consistent
- Cross-references maintained

### Next Steps
All parsing tasks are complete. The Financial Engineering directory is now fully formatted and ready for use in knowledge management systems like Obsidian.
