# A Brief Introduction to Stochastic Calculus

These lecture notes introduce fixed income derivative securities and the modeling philosophy used to price these securities. We will use binomial lattice models for doing this and the securities we will consider include bond futures and forwards, caplets and caps, floorlets and floors, and swaps and swaptions.

Fixed-income models are inherently more complex than security models as we need to model the evolution of the entire term-structure of interest rates. The short-rate, $r_t$, is the variable of interest in many fixed income models and we will focus on this in our lattice models. Our pricing "philosophy" will be to simply specify risk-neutral probabilities for the short-rate, $r_t$, and to do so without any reference to the true dynamics of the short-rate.

This is in contrast to the way we developed risk-neutral pricing in the binomial model for stocks. In the lattice models of these notes, however, we will price securities in such a way that guarantees no-arbitrage.

We also note that since the financial crisis of 2008/2009 there have been substantial developments in term structure modeling. In particular (and in contrast to the pre-crisis world) it is now widely recognized that the pricing of LIBOR-based derivatives such as swaps, swaptions, caps, floors etc. require a so-called multi-curve framework with a separate curve necessary for each tenor. We do not develop the multi-curve framework in these notes as our goal is simply to learn the basics of term structure modeling and fixed income derivatives pricing.

## 1 Binomial-Lattice Models

We begin with binomial-lattice models of the short rate. These models may be viewed as models in their own right or as approximations to more sophisticated continuous-time one-factor short-rate models. These models will also be used to introduce various interest rate derivatives that are commonly traded in the financial markets.

### 1.1 Constructing An Arbitrage-Free Lattice

Consider the binomial lattice below where we specify the short rate, $r_{i,j}$, that will apply for the single period beginning at node $N(i,j)$. This means for example that if $1 is deposited in the cash account at $t = i$, state $j$ (i.e. node $N(i,j)$), then this deposit will be worth $(1 + r_{i,j})$ at time $t + 1$ regardless of the successor node to $N(i,j)$.

We use martingale pricing on this lattice to compute security prices. For example, if $S_i(j)$ is the value of a non-dividend/coupon paying security at time $i$ and state $j$, then we *insist* that

$$S_{i}(j) = \frac{1}{1+r_{i,j}}\left[q_{u} S_{i+1}(j+1)+q_{d} S_{i+1}(j)\right] \tag{1}$$

where $q_u$ and $q_d$ are the probabilities of up- and down-moves, respectively. If the security pays a coupon this should be included in the right-hand side of (1). Such a model is arbitrage-free *by construction*.

### 1.2 Computing The Term-Structure From The Lattice

It is easy to compute the price of a zero-coupon bond once the EMM, $\mathbb{Q}$, (with the cash account as numeraire) and the short-rate lattice are specified. In the short rate-lattice below (where the short rate increases by a factor of $u = 1.25$ or decreases by a factor of $d = 0.8$ in each period), we assume that the $\mathbb{Q}$-probability of each branch is $0.5$ and node-independent. We can then use martingale-pricing to compute the prices of zero-coupon bonds.

 | Short Rate Lattice | 0.183 |  |  |  |
 | -------------------- | --------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | 
| 0.146 | 0.132 |  |  |
| 0.117 | 0.105 | 0.095 |  |
 | 0.094 | 0.084 | 0.076 | 0.068 |  |
 | 0.075 | 0.068 | 0.061 | 0.055 | 0.049 |
 | 0.060 | 0.054 | 0.049 | 0.044 | 0.039 | 0.035 | 
 | t=0 | t=1 | t=2 | t=3 | t=4 | t=5 | 

**Example 1** (Pricing a Zero-Coupon Bond)
We compute the price of a 4-period zero-coupon bond with face value $100 that expires at $t = 4$. Assuming the short-rate lattice is as given above, we see, for example, that the bond price at node (2, 2) is given by

$$83.08 = \frac{1}{1+0.105}\left[\frac{1}{2} \times 89.51+\frac{1}{2} \times 92.22\right]$$

 | 4-Year Zero | 100.00 |  |  |
 | ------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
| 89.51 | 100.00 |  |
 | 83.08 | 92.22 | 100.00 |  |
 | 79.27 | 87.35 | 94.27 | 100.00 |
 | 77.22 | 85.51 | 91.74 | 96.62 | 100.00 | 

Note that given the price of the 4-period zero-coupon bond, we can now find the 4-period spot rate, $s_4$. It satisfies $77.22 = 100/(1 + s_4)[^4]$ if we quote spot rates on a per-period basis. In this manner we can construct the entire term-structure by evaluating zero-coupon bond prices for all maturities.

### 1.3 Pricing Non-Standard Securities in the Lattice

We can now use our short-rate lattice to price other more complex securities. As an example we consider pricing a bond future.

**Example 2** (Bond Futures)
Consider a futures contract with an underlying 4-period zero-coupon bond with face value $100. The futures contract matures at $t = 3$ and has futures price $F(i,j)$. We know that $F(3,j) = P(3,j)$ where $P(3,j)$ is the $t = 3$ value of the underlying bond. To find the futures price at earlier nodes, we use the fact that the (risk-neutral) expected discounted gain on a futures contract is zero. Hence:

$$F(i,j) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{Q}}\left[ F(i+1,\cdot) | (i,j) \right] = q_u F(i+1,j+1) + q_d F(i+1,j) \tag{2}$$

Using the payoffs $F(3,j) = P(3,j)$ in equation (2), we can use backward induction to compute $F(0,0)$:

 | 3-Period Bond Future | 93.24 |  |
 | ---------------------- | --------- | ------- | ------- | 
| 92.41 | 94.52 |
| 91.87 | 93.73 | 95.65 | 
| 91.74 | 93.46 | 95.24 | 96.62 | 

Note how the futures price differs from the forward price.

## 2 Elementary Securities

**Definition**: An elementary (or Arrow-Debreu) security pays $1 at node $N(i,j)$ and $0 everywhere else.

Let $\mathcal{E}(i,j;0,0)$ denote the price at node $N(0,0)$ of the elementary security paying $1 at node $N(i,j)$. Using the risk-neutral pricing formula:

$$\mathcal{E}(i,j;0,0) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{Q}}\left[ \frac{1_{\{N(i,j)\}}}{\prod_{k=0}^{i-1}(1+r_k)} \right]$$

where $r_k$ is the short rate at time $k$ along the path to node $N(i,j)$.

### 2.1 Computing Elementary Security Prices

Elementary security prices can be computed recursively:

$$\mathcal{E}(i+1,j+1;0,0) = \frac{q_u}{1+r_{0,0}} \cdot \mathcal{E}(i,j;0,0)$$
$$\mathcal{E}(i+1,j;0,0) = \frac{q_d}{1+r_{0,0}} \cdot \mathcal{E}(i,j;0,0)$$

with initial condition $\mathcal{E}(0,0;0,0) = 1$.

**Example 3** (Elementary Security Prices)
Using our short-rate lattice with $q_u = q_d = 0.5$:

 | Elementary Securities | 0.472 | 0.236 | 0.118 | 0.059 | 
 | ---------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | 
| 0.472 | 0.472 | 0.354 | 0.236 | 
|  | 0.236 | 0.354 | 0.354 | 
|  |  | 0.118 | 0.236 | 
|  |  |  | 0.059 | 

Note that zero-coupon bond prices can be written as sums of elementary prices:

$$P(0,T) = \sum_{j=0}^{T} \mathcal{E}(T,j;0,0)$$

## 3 Interest Rate Derivatives

### 3.1 Caps and Floors

A **caplet** pays $\max(r_T - K, 0)$ at time $T+1$ based on the short rate $r_T$ at time $T$. A **cap** is a portfolio of caplets.

A **floorlet** pays $\max(K - r_T, 0)$ at time $T+1$ based on the short rate $r_T$ at time $T$. A **floor** is a portfolio of floorlets.

**Example 4** (Pricing a Caplet)
Consider a caplet with strike $K = 0.08$ and maturity $T = 2$. The payoff at $t = 3$ depends on $r_2$:

 | Node | $r_2$ | Payoff | 
 | ------ | ------- | --------- | 
 | (2,2) | 0.105 | 0.025 | 
 | (2,1) | 0.084 | 0.004 | 
 | (2,0) | 0.068 | 0.000 | 

Using backward induction: Caplet price = $0.00746$

### 3.2 Interest Rate Swaps and Swaptions

An **interest rate swap** is an agreement to exchange fixed and floating rate payments. The **swap rate** is the fixed rate that makes the initial value zero.

A **swaption** is an option to enter a swap at a predetermined swap rate.

## 4 Calibration of Models

The Ho-Lee model and Black-Derman-Toy (BDT) model are two popular approaches for calibrating short-rate models to market data.

### 4.1 The Ho-Lee Model

In the Ho-Lee model, the short rate follows:
$$r_{i+1,j+1} = r_{i,j} + \theta_i + \sigma$$
$$r_{i+1,j} = r_{i,j} + \theta_i - \sigma$$

where $\theta_i$ are drift parameters chosen to match the observed term structure.

**Calibration procedure**:
1. Set $r_{0,0}$ from the observed 1-period rate
2. For each period $i$, find $\theta_i$ such that the model bond price matches the market price
3. Use the calibrated model to price derivatives

### 4.2 The Black-Derman-Toy Model

The BDT model assumes lognormal short rates:
$$\ln(r_{i+1,j+1}) = \ln(r_{i,j}) + \theta_i + \sigma_i$$
$$\ln(r_{i+1,j}) = \ln(r_{i,j}) + \theta_i - \sigma_i$$

This model can match both the term structure and volatility structure.

**Calibration procedure**:
1. Set $r_{0,0}$ from the observed 1-period rate
2. For each period $i$:
   - Find $\theta_i$ to match bond prices
   - Find $\sigma_i$ to match volatilities
3. Use the calibrated model to price derivatives

## 5 Extensions and Advanced Topics

### 5.1 Multi-Factor Models

Single-factor models may be insufficient for complex derivatives. Multi-factor models allow for:
- Richer dynamics
- Better fit to market data
- More realistic correlation structures

### 5.2 Term Structure Models

Popular continuous-time models include:
- Vasicek model
- Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model
- Hull-White model
- Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) framework

### 5.3 Credit Risk

Incorporating credit risk requires:
- Default probabilities
- Recovery rates
- Credit spreads
- Correlation between interest rates and credit events
