# Derivative (finance)  

In finance, a derivative is a financial instrument (or, more simply, an agreement between two parties) that has a value, based on the expected future price movements of the asset to which it is linked-called the underlying assetl] such as a share or a [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). There are many kinds of [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), with the most common being swaps, [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), and options. [Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) are a form of alternative [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).  

A derivative is not a stand-alone asset, since it has no value of its own. However, more common types of [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md). have been traded on markets before their [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) as if they were assets. Among the oldest of these are rice [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) which have ben traded on the Dojima Rice Exchange since the eighteenth century 21  

[Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) are usually broadly categorized by:  

. the relationship between the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) and the derivative (e.g., forward, option, swap);.   
:the type of [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) (e.g., equity [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), foreign exchange [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), interest rate [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), [commodity derivatives](Derivatives/Part%20VII%20-%20Advanced%20Options/Chapter%2032%20-%20Energy%20and%20Weather%20Derivatives.md) or [credit derivatives](../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md));   
. the market in which they trade (e.g., exchange-traded or over-the-counter);.   
:their pay-off profile.  

Another arbitrary distinction is between:[3]  

vanilla [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) (simple and more common); and.   
[exotic derivatives](Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Exotic%20Options.md) (more complicated and specialized).  

# Uses  

[Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) are used by investors to:  provide [leverage](../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) (or gearing), such that a small movement in the underlying value can cause a large difference in the value of the derivative; speculate and make a profit if the value of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) moves the way they expect (e.g., moves in a given direction, stays in or out of a specified range, reaches a certain level); hedge or mitigate risk in the underlying, by entering into a derivative contract whose value moves in the opposite direction to their underlying position and cancels part or all of it out; obtain exposure to the underlying where it is not possible to trade in the underlying (e.g., weather [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md)); create option ability where the value of the derivative is linked to a specific condition or event (e.g., the underlying reaching a specific price level).  

# Hedging  

[Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) can be considered as providing a form of insurance in [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md), which is itself a technique that attempts to reduce risk.  

[Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) allow risk related to the price of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) to be transferred from one party to another. For example, a wheat farmer and a miller could sign a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract to exchange a specified amount of cash for a specified amount of wheat in the future. Both parties have reduced a future risk: for the wheat farmer, the uncertainty of the price, and for the miller, the availability of wheat. However, there is still the risk that no wheat will be available because of events unspecified by the contract, such as the weather, or that one party will renege on the contract. Although a third party, called a clearing house, insures a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract, not all [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) are insured against counter-party risk.  

From another perspective, the farmer and the miller both reduce a risk and acquire a risk when they sign the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). contract: the farmer reduces the risk that the price of wheat will fall below the price specified in the contract and. acquires the risk that the price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract (thereby losing additional income that he could have earned). The miller, on the other hand, acquires the risk that the price of wheat will fall below the price specified in the contract (thereby paying more in the future than he otherwise would have) and reduces the risk that the price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract. In this sense, one party is the insurer (risk taker) for one type of risk, and the counter-party is the insurer (risk taker) for another type of risk.  

[Hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) also occurs when an individual or institution buys an asset (such as a commodity, a bond that has coupon.   
payments, a stock that pays dividends, and so on) and sells it using a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract. The individual or institution.   
has access to the asset for a specified amount of time, and can then sell it in the future at a specified price according.   
to the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract. Of course, this allows the individual or institution the benefit of holding the asset, while.   
reducing the risk that the future selling price will deviate unexpectedly from the market's current assessment of the future value of the asset.  

[Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) can serve legitimate business purposes. For example, a corporation borrows a large sum of money at a specific interest rate.4 The rate of interest on the loan resets every six months. The corporation is concerned that the rate of interest may be much higher in six months. The corporation could buy a [forward rate](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) agreement (FRA), which is a contract to pay a fixed rate of interest six months after purchases on a notional. amount of money.[5] 1f the interest rate after six months is above the contract rate, the seller will pay the. difference to the corporation, or FRA buyer. If the rate is lower, the corporation will pay the difference to the seller. The purchase of the FRA serves to reduce the uncertainty concerning the rate increase and stabilize earnings.

[Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) traders at the Chicago Board of Trade.  

# Speculation and arbitrage  

[Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) can be used to acquire risk, rather than to insure or hedge against risk. Thus, some individuals and institutions will enter into a derivative contract to speculate on the value of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md), betting that the. party seeking insurance will be wrong about the future value of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). Speculators look to buy an asset in the future at a low price according to a derivative contract when the future market price is high, or to sell an asset in the future at a high price according to a derivative contract when the future market price is low..  

Individuals and institutions may also look for [arbitrage opportunities](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md), as when the current buying price of an asset falls below the price specified in a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract to sell the asset..  

Speculative trading in [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) gained a great deal of notoriety in 1995 when Nick Leeson, a trader at Barings. Bank, made poor and unauthorized investments in [futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md). Through a combination of poor judgment, lack of oversight by the bank's management and regulators, and unfortunate events like the Kobe earthquake, Leeson. incurred a US\$1.3 billion loss that bankrupted the centuries-old institution.16]  

# Types of derivatives  

# OTC and exchange-traded  

In broad terms, there are two groups of derivative contracts, which are distinguished by the way they are traded in the market:  

:Over-the-counter (OTC) [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) are contracts that are traded (and privately negotiated) directly between two parties, without going through an exchange or other intermediary. Products such as swaps, [forward rate agreements](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/EURIBOR%20Forward%20Rate%20Agreements%20and%20Futures.md), and [exotic](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Exotic%20Interest%20Rate%20Options.md) options are almost always traded in this way. The OTC derivative market is the largest market for [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), and is largely unregulated with respect to disclosure of information between the parties, since the OTC market is made up of banks and other highly sophisticated parties, such as [hedge funds](Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md). Reporting of OTC amounts are difficult because trades can occur in private, without activity being visible on any exchange. According to the Bank for International Settlements, the total outstanding notional amount is US\$684 trillion (as of June 2008). Of this total notional amount, $67\%$ are interest rate contracts, $8\%$ are credit default swaps (CDS), $9\%$ are foreign exchange contracts, $2\%$ are commodity contracts, $1\%$ are equity contracts, and $12\%$ are other. Because OTC [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) are not traded on an exchange, there is no central counter-party. Therefore, they are. subject to counter-party risk, like an ordinary contract, since each counter-party relies on the other to perform.   
Exchange-traded derivative contracts (ETD) are those [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) instruments that are traded via specialized [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) exchanges or other exchanges. A [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) exchange is a market where individuals trade standardized contracts that hae been defined by the exchange.8 A [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) exchange act as an intermediary to all related transactions, and takes Initial margin from both sides of the trade to act as a guarantee. The world's largestl9 [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) exchanges (by number of transactions) are the Korea Exchange (which lists KOSPI Index [Futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) & Options), Eurex (which lists a wide range of European products such as interest rate & index products), and CME Group (made up of the 2007 merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade and the 2008 acquisition of the New York Mercantile Exchange). According to BIS, the combined turnover. in the world's [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) exchanges totaled USD 344 trillion during Q4 2005. Some types of derivative. instruments also may trade on traditional exchanges. For instance, hybrid instruments such as convertible bonds and/or convertible preferred may be listed on stock or bond exchanges. Also, warrants (or "rights") may be listed. on equity exchanges. Performance Rights, Cash xPRTs and various other instruments that essentially consist of a. complex set of options bundled into a simple package are routinely listed on equity exchanges. Like other [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), these publicly traded [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) provide investors [access to risk](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/A%20Simple%20Classification%20of%20Structured%20Notes.md)/reward and volatility characteristics that, while related to an underlying commodity, nonetheless are distinctive.  

# Common derivative contract types  

There are three major classes of [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md):  

1. [Futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)/[Forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) are contracts to buy or sell an asset on or before a future date at a price specified today. A [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract differs from a [forward contract](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) in that the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is a standardized contract written by a. clearing house that operates an exchange where the contract can be bought and sold, whereas a [forward contract](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) is a non-standardized contract written by the parties themselves.   
2. Options are contracts that give the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy (in the case of a call option) or sell (in the case of a put option) an asset. The price at which the sale takes place is known as the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md), and is specified at the time the parties enter into the option. The option contract also specifies a maturity date. In the case of a European option, the owner has the right to require the sale to take place on (but not before) the maturity date; in the case of an American option, the owner can require the sale to take place at any time up to the maturity. date. If the owner of the contract [exercises](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) this right, the counter-party has the obligation to carry out the transaction.  

3. Swaps are contracts to exchange cash (flows) on or before a specified future date based on the underlying value of currencies/exchange rates, bonds/[interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md), [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), stocks or other assets.  

More complex [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) can be created by combining the elements of these basic types. For example, the holder of a swaption has the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a swap on or before a specified future date.  

# Examples  

The overall [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) market has five major classes of [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md):

# Valuation  

# Market and arbitrage-free prices  

Two common measures of value are:  
Market price, i.e., the price at which traders are willing to buy or sell the contract;   
[Arbitrage-free price](Determining%20the%20Stochastic%20Process%20for%20a%20Forward%20Contract%20from%20Itoâ€™s%20Lemma.md), meaning that no risk-free profits can be made by trading in these contracts;  

# Determining the market price  

For exchange-traded [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), market price is usually transparent  

![](7f5de59cccf42d963c0e5db6dfb6b04c89747083278c2a88a2f9c8739244d1cd.jpg)  
World Wealth vs World [Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) 1998-2007  

Total world [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) from 1998-2007[12] compared to total world wealth in the year 2000[13]  

(often published in real time by the exchange, based on all the current bids and offers placed on that particular contract at any one time). Complications can arise with OTC or floor-traded contracts though, as trading is handled. manually, making it difficult to automatically broadcast prices. In particular with OTC contracts, there is no central. exchange to collate and disseminate prices.  

# Determining the arbitrage-free price  

The [arbitrage-free price](Determining%20the%20Stochastic%20Process%20for%20a%20Forward%20Contract%20from%20Itoâ€™s%20Lemma.md) for a [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) contract is complex, and there are many different variables to consider. [Arbitrage-free pricing](6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md) is a central topic of [financial mathematics](Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md). The [stochastic process](../The%20Ornstein-Uhlenbeck%20(OU)%20Process.md) of the price of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) is often crucial. A key equation for the theoretical valuation of options is the [Black-Scholes formula](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%205.md), which is based on the assumption that the cash flows from a European stock option can be replicated by a continuous buying and selling strategy using only the stock. A simplified version of this valuation technique is the [binomial](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/A%20Real-Life%20Option%20Pricing%20Exercise.md) options model. OTC represents the biggest challenge in using models to price [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md). Since these. contracts are not publicly traded, no market price is available to validate the theoretical valuation. And most of the model's results are input-dependant (meaning the final price depends heavily on how we derive the [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) inputs).!14] Therefore it is common that OTC [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) are priced by Independent Agents that both counterparties involved in the deal designate upfront (when signing the contract).  

# Criticism  

[Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) are often subject to the following criticisms:  

# Possible large losses  

The use of [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) can result in large losses because of the use of [leverage](../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md), or borrowing. [Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) allow. investors to earn large [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) from small movements in the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md)'s price. However, investors could lose large amounts if the price of the underlying moves against them significantly. There have been several instances of massive losses in derivative markets, such as:.  

.The need to recapitalize insurer American International Group (AIG) with $\mathrm{USS}85$ billion of debt provided by the US federal government.!15] An AIG subsidiary had lost more than $\mathrm{USS18}$ billion over the preceding three quarters on Credit Default Swaps (CDs) it had writte.16 It was reported that the recapitalization was  

necessary because further losses were foreseeable over the next few quarters.  

.The loss of. $\mathrm{US}\$7.2$ Billion by Societe Generale in January 2008 through mis-use of futures contracts. .The loss of. ${\mathrm{US}}\$6.4$ billion in the failed fund Amaranth Advisors, which was long natural gas in September 2006 when the price plummeted. .The loss of ${\mathrm{USS4.6}}$ billion in the failed fund [Long-Term Capital Management](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Turmoil%20in%20Financial%20Markets%20the%20Risk%20Business.md) in 1998. : The loss of $\mathrm{US}\$1.3$ billion equivalent in oil derivatives in 1993 and 1994 by Metallgesellschaft AG.[17] : The loss of $\mathrm{US}\$1.2$ billion equivalent in equity [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) in 1995 by Barings Bank.[18]  

# Counter-party risk  

Some [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) (especially swaps) expose investors to counter-party risk.  

For example, suppose a person wanting a [fixed interest rate](Derivatives/Part%20VIII%20-%20Swaps/Chapter%2036%20-%20Currency%20Swaps.md) loan for his business, but finding that banks only offer variable rates, swaps payments with another business who wants a variable rate, synthetically creating a fixed rate for the person. However if the second business goes bankrupt, it can't pay its variable rate and so the first business will lose its fixed rate and will be paying a variable rate again. If [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) have increased, it is possible that the first business may be adversely affected, because it may not be prepared to pay the higher variable rate.  

Different types of [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) have different levels of counter-party risk. For example, standardized stock options by law require the party at risk to have a certain amount deposited with the exchange, showing that they can pay for any.   
losses; banks that help businesses swap variable for fixed rates on loans may do credit checks on both parties..   
However, in private agreements between two companies, for example, there may not be benchmarks for performing.   
due diligence and [risk analysis](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%203/Week%203%20Financial%20Risk%20Analysis.md).  

# Large notional value  

[Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) typically have a large notional value. As such, there is the danger that their use could result in losses that the investor would be unable to compensate for. The possibility that this could lead to a chain reaction ensuing in an economic crisis, has been pointed out by famed investor Warren [Buffett](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Warren%20Buffet%20Case%20Study.md) in Berkshire Hathaway's 2002 annual report. [Buffett](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Warren%20Buffet%20Case%20Study.md) called them 'financial weapons of mass destruction.' The problem with [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) is that they control an increasingly larger notional amount of assets and this may lead to distortions in the real capital and equities markets. Investors begin to look at the [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) markets to make a decision to buy or sell securities and so what was originally meant to be a market to transfer risk now becomes a leading indicator. (See Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report for 2002) [19]  

# Leverage of an economy's debt  

[Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) massively [leverage](../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) the debt in an economy, making it ever more difficult for the underlying real economy to service its debt obligations, thereby curtailing real economic activity, which can cause a recession or even depression. In the view of Marriner S. Eccles, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman from November, 1934 to February, 1948, too high a level of debt was one of the primary causes of the 1920s-30s [Great Depression](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%201928-1937.md). (See Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report for 2002)  

# Benefits  

The use of [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) also has its benefits:  

.[Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) facilitate the buying and selling of risk, and many people consider this to have a positive impact on. the economic system. Although someone loses money while someone else gains money with a derivative, under normal circumstances, trading in [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) should not adversely affect the economic system because it is not. zero sum in utility.  

. Former Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan commented in 2003 that he believed that the use of [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) has softened the impact of the economic downturn at the beginning of the 21st century.  

# Government regulation  

In the context of a 2010 examination of the ICE Trust, an industry self-regulatory body, Gary Gensler, the chairman. of the [Commodity Futures](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md) Trading Commission which regulates most [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), was quoted saying that the [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) marketplace as it functions now "adds up to higher costs to all Americans." More oversight of the banks in this market is needed, he also said. Additionally, the report said, "It]he Department of Justice is looking into. [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), too. The department's antitrust unit is actively investigating 'the possibility of anticompetitive practices. in the [credit derivatives](../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) clearing, trading and information services industries,' according to a department. spokeswoman. "[20]  

# Definitions  

.Bilateral netting: A legally enforceable arrangement between a bank and a counter-party that creates a single lega. obligation covering all included individual contracts. This means that a bank's obligation, in the event of the default or insolvency of one of the parties, would be the net sum of all positive and negative fair values of contracts included in the bilateral netting arrangement.   
.Credit derivative: A contract that transfers [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) from a [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) to a credit [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md). Credit derivative products can take many forms, such as credit default swaps, credit linked notes and [total return swaps](Derivatives/Part%20X%20-%20Credit%20Derivatives/Chapter%2043%20-%20Securitisation,%20ABSs%20and%20CDOs.md).   
:Derivative: A financial contract whose value is derived from the performance of assets, [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md), [currency exchange](../Clippings/Currency%20Swap%20Basics.md) rates, or indexes. Derivative transactions include a wide assortment of [financial contracts](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md) including structured debt obligations and deposits, swaps, [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), options, caps, [floors](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Caps%20and%20Floors.md), collars, [forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) and various combinations thereof.   
Exchange-traded derivative contracts: Standardized derivative contracts (e.g., [futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) and options) that are transacted on an organized [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) exchange.. Gross negative fair value: The sum of the fair values of contracts where the bank owes money to its. counter-parties, without taking into account netting. This represents the maximum losses the bank's counter-parties would incur if the bank defaults and there is no netting of contracts, and no bank collateral was held by the counter-parties. Gross positive fair value: The sum total of the fair values of contracts where the bank is owed money by its counter-parties, without taking into account netting. This represents the maximum losses a bank could incur if all its counter-parties default and there is no netting of contracts, and the bank holds no counter-party collateral.   
:High-risk mortgage securities: Securities where the price or expected average life is highly sensitive to [interest rate changes](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke-Chapter%2012%20to%20Chapter%2014.md), as determined by the FFIEC policy statement on high-risk mortgage securities.   
:Notional amount: The nominal or face amount that is used to calculate payments made on swaps and other [risk management](Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) products. This amount generally does not change hands and is thus referred to as notional.   
Over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts: Privately negotiated derivative contracts that are transacted off organized [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) exchanges.

Total risk-based capital: The sum of tier 1 plus tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital consists of common shareholders equity, perpetual preferred shareholders equity with non-cumulative dividends, retained earnings, and minority. interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Tier 2 capital consists of subordinated debt, intermediate-term preferred stock, cumulative and long-term preferred stock, and a portion of a bank's allowance for loan and lease losses.

# Futures contract  

In finance, a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is a standardized contract between two parties to buy or sell a specified asset (e.g.. oranges, oil, gold) of standardized quantity and quality at a specified future date at a price agreed today (the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). price). The contracts are traded on a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) exchange. [Futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) are not "direct" securities like stocks, bonds, rights or warrants. They are still securities, however, though they are a type of derivative contract. The party. agreeing to buy the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) in the future assumes a [long position](Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%204%20-%20Futures:%20Hedging%20and%20Speculation.md), and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future assumes a short position.  

The price is determined by the instantaneous equilibrium between the forces of supply and demand among competing buy and sell orders on the exchange at the time of the purchase or sale of the contract.  

In many cases, the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) to a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract may not be traditional "[commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)" at all - that is, for financial [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) or item can be currencies, securities or [financial instruments](../Financial%20Instruments/A%20Practical%20Guide%20for%20Actuaries%20and%20other%20Business%20Professionals..md) and intangible assets or referenced items such as stock indexes and [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).  

The future date is called the delivery date or final settlement date. The official price of the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract at the end of a day's trading session on the exchange is called the settlement price for that day of business on the exchange.1]  

A closely related contract is a [forward contract](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md); they differ in certain respects. [Futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) are very similar to forward contracts, except they are exchange-traded and defined on standardized assets.2] Unlike [forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md), [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) typically have interim partial settlements or "true-ups" in [margin requirements](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Case%20Study%20Mf%20Globals%20Repo-To-Maturity%20Trades.md). For typical [forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md), the net gain or loss accrued over the life of the contract is realized on the delivery date.  

A [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract gives the holder the obligation to make or take delivery under the terms of the contract, whereas. an option grants the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to establish a position previously held by the seller of the. option. In other words, the owner of an options contract may exercise the contract, but both parties of a "[futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract" must fulfill the contract on the settlement date. The seller delivers the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) to the buyer, or, if it. is a cash-settled [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract, then cash is transferred from the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) trader who sustained a loss to the one who made a profit. To exit the commitment prior to the settlement date, the holder of a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position has to offset. his/her position by either selling a [long position](Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%204%20-%20Futures:%20Hedging%20and%20Speculation.md) or buying back (covering) a short position, effectively closing out. the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position and its contract obligations.  

[Futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md), or simply [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), (but not future or future contract) are exchange-traded [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md). The exchange's clearing house acts as counterparty on all contracts, sets [margin requirements](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Case%20Study%20Mf%20Globals%20Repo-To-Maturity%20Trades.md), and crucially also provides a mechanism for setlement.

# Origin  

Aristotle described the story of Thales, a poor philosopher from Miletus who developed a "financial device, which involves a principle of universal application". Thales used his skill in [forecasting](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md) and predicted that the olive harvest would be exceptionally good the next autumn. Confident in his prediction, he made agreements with local olive press owners to deposit his money with them to guarantee him exclusive use of their olive presses when the harvest was ready. Thales successfully negotiated low prices because the harvest was in the future and no one knew whether the harvest would be plentiful or poor and because the olive press owners were willing to hedge against the possibility of. a poor yield. When the harvest time came, and many presses were wanted concurrently and suddenly, he let them out at any rate he pleased, and made a large quantit of money .4]  

The first [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) exchange market was the Dojima Rice Exchange in Japan in the 1730s, to meet the needs of samurai who--being paid in rice, and after a series of bad harvests--needed a stable conversion to coin.[5]  

The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) listed the first ever standardized 'exchange traded' forward contracts in 1864, which were called [futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md). This contract was based on grain trading and started a trend that saw contracts created on a number of different [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) as well as a number of [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) exchanges set up in countries around the world.6 By 1875 cotton [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) were being traded in Mumbai in India and within a few years this had expanded to [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) on edibl oileeds complex, raw jut and jute oods and bullion.7]  

# Standardization  

[Futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) ensure their [liquidity](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) by being highly standardized, usually by specifying:  

.The [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) or instrument. This could be anything from a barrel of crude oil to a short term interest rate.   
:The type of settlement, either [cash settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Swaptions.md) or [physical settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Futures%20and%20Forwards.md)..   
.The amount and units of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) per contract.

# Margin  

To minimize [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) to the exchange, traders must post a margin or a performance bond, typically $5\%-15\%$ of the contract's value.  

To minimize counterparty risk to traders, trades executed on regulated [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) exchanges are guaranteed by a clearing house. The clearing house becomes the buyer to each seller, and the seller to each buyer, so that in the event of a counterparty default the clearer assumes the risk of loss. This enables traders to transact without performing due. diligence on their counterparty.  

[Margin requirements](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Case%20Study%20Mf%20Globals%20Repo-To-Maturity%20Trades.md) are waived or reduced in some cases for hedgers who have physical ownership of the covered commodity or spread traders who have offsetting contracts balancing the position..

Clearing margins are distinct from customer margins that individual buyers and sellers of [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) and options contracts are required to deposit with brokers.

Customer margin Within the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) industry, financial guarantees required of both buyers and sellers of [futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) and sellers of options contracts to ensure fulfillment of contract obligations. [Futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) Commission  

Merchants are responsible for overseeing customer [margin accounts](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Short%20Selling.md). Margins are determined on the basis of [market risk](Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%205%20-%20Index%20Futures.md) and contract value. Also referred to as performance bond margin.  

Initial margin is the equity required to initiate a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) position. This is a type of performance bond. The maximum. exposure is not limited to the amount of the initial margin, however the initial margin requirement is calculated based on the maximum estimated change in contract value within a trading day. Initial margin is set by the exchange..  

If a position involves an exchange-traded product, the amount or percentage of initial margin is set by the exchange concerned.  

In case of loss or if the value of the initial margin is being eroded, the broker will make a margin call in order to restore the amount of initial margin available. Often referred to as "[variation margin](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Repurchase%20Agreements.md)", margin called for this reason is usually done on a daily basis, however, in times of high volatility a broker can make a margin call or calls intra-day..  

Calls for margin are usually expected to be paid and received on the same day. If not, the broker has the right to close sufficient positions to meet the amount called by way of margin. After the position is closed-out the client is liable for any resulting deficit in the client's account.  

Some U.S. exchanges also use the term "maintenance margin", which in effect defines by how much the value of the initial margin can reduce before a margin call is made. However, most non-US brokers only use the term "initial margin" and "[variation margin](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Repurchase%20Agreements.md)".  

The Initial Margin requirement is established by the [Futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) exchange, in contrast to other securities Initial Margin (which is set by the Federal Reserve in the U.S. Markets)..  

A [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) account is marked to market daily. If the margin drops below the margin maintenance requirement. established by the exchange listing the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), a margin call will be issued to bring the account back up to the required level.  

Maintenance margin A set minimum margin per outstanding [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract that a customer must maintain in his margin account.  

Margin-equity ratio is a term used by speculators, representing the amount of their trading capital that is being held as margin at any particular time. The low [margin requirements](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Case%20Study%20Mf%20Globals%20Repo-To-Maturity%20Trades.md) of [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) results in substantial [leverage](../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) of the [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). However, the exchanges require a minimum amount that varies depending on the contract and the trader. The broker may set the requirement higher, but may not set it lower. A trader, of course, can set it above that, if he does not want to be subject to [margin calls](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md).  

Performance bond margin The amount of money deposited by both a buyer and seller of a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract or an options seller to ensure performance of the term of the contract. Margin in [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) is not a payment of equity or down payment on the commodity itself, but rather it is a security deposit.  

Return on margin (ROM) is often used to judge performance because it represents the gain or loss compared to the exchange's perceived risk as reflected in required margin. ROM may be calculated ([realized return](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md)) / (initial margin). The Annualized ROM is equal to $(\mathrm{ROM}+1$ (year/trade [duration](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)) 1. For example if a rader earns $10\%$ on margin in two months, that would be about $77\%$ annualized.  

# Settlement - physical versus cash-settled futures  

Settlement is [the act](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/The%20Dodd%20Frank%20Act%20and%20Its%20Impact.md) of consummating the contract, and can be done in one of two ways, as specified per type of [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract:  

Physical delivery - the amount specified of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) of the contract is delivered by the seller of the contract to the exchange, and by the exchange to the buyers of the contract. Physical delivery is common with. [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) and bonds. In practice, it occurs only on a minority of contracts. Most are cancelled out by. purchasing a covering position - that is, buying a contract to cancel out an earlier sale (covering a short), or selling a contract to liquidate an earlier purchase (covering a long). The Nymex crude [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract uses this method

For example, for most CME and CBOT contracts, at the expiration of the December contract, the March [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) become the nearest contract. This is an exciting time for [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) desks, which try to make quick profits during the short period (perhaps 30 minutes) during which the underlying cash price and the [futures price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) sometimes struggle to converge.

At this moment also, the increase in volume is caused by traders rolling over positions to the next contract or, in the case of equity index [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), purchasing underlying components of those indexes to hedge against current index positions.

Thus, the [futures price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) in fact varies within [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) boundaries around the theoretical price.  

# Pricing via expectation  

When the deliverable commodity is not in plentiful supply (or when it does not yet exist) rational [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) cannot be applied, as the [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) mechanism is not applicable. Here the price of the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) is determined by today's supply and demand for the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) in the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)..  

In a deep and liquid market, supply and demand would be expected to balance out at a price which represents an unbiased expectation of the future price of the actual asset and so be given by the simple relationship.  
$$
{\cal F}(t)=E_{t}\left\{S(T)\right\}.
$$  

By contrast, in a shallow and illiquid market, or in a market in which large quantities of the deliverable asset have been deliberately withheld from market participants (an illegal action known as cornering the market), the market clearing price for the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) may still represent the balance between supply and demand but the relationship between this price and the expected future price of the asset can break down.  

# Relationship between arbitrage arguments and expectation  

The expectation based relationship will also hold in a no-[arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) setting when we take [expectations](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) with respect to the risk-neutral probability. In other words: a [futures price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) is martingale with respect to the risk-neutral probability. With this [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) rule, a speculator is expected to break even when the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) market fairly prices the deliverable commodity.  

# Contango and backwardation  

The situation where the price of a commodity for future delivery is higher than the spot price, or where a far future. delivery price is higher than a nearer future delivery, is known as contango. The reverse, where the price of a. commodity for future delivery is lower than the spot price, or where a far future delivery price is lower than a nearer future delivery, is known as backwardation..

# Who trades futures?  

[Futures traders](Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%202%20-%20Futures%20Markets.md) are traditionally placed in one of two groups: hedgers, who have an interest in the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) (which could include an intangible such as an index or interest rate) and are seeking to hedge out the risk of price changes; and speculators, who seek to make a profit by predicting market moves and opening a derivative contract related to the asset "on paper", while they have no practical use for or intent to actually take or make delivery of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). In other words, the investor is seeking exposure to the asset in a long [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) or the opposite effect via a short [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract.  

Hedgers typically include producers and consumers of a commodity or the owner of an asset or assets subject to certain influences such as an interest rate.  

For example, in traditional commodity markets, farmers often sell [futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) for the crops and livestock they produce to guarantee a certain price, making it easier for them to plan. Similarly, livestock producers often purchase [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) to cover their feed costs, so that they can plan on a fixed cost for feed. In modern (financial) markets, "producers" of interest rate swaps or equity derivative products will use financial [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) or equity index [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) to reduce or remove the risk on the swap.  

An example that has both hedge and speculative notions involves a mutual fund or separately managed account whose [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) objective is to track the performance of a [stock index](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) such as the S&P 500 [stock index](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md). The [Portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) manager often "equitizes" cash inflows in an easy and cost effective manner by investing in (opening long). S&P 500 [stock index futures](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md). This gains the [portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) exposure to the index which is consistent with the fund or. account [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) objective without having to buy an appropriate proportion of each of the individual 500 stocks. just yet. This also preserves balanced diversification, maintains a higher degree of the percent of assets invested in. the market and helps reduce tracking error in the performance of the fund/account. When it is economically feasible. (an efficient amount of shares of every individual position within the fund or account can be purchased), the [portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) manager can close the contract and make purchases of each individual stock..  

The social utility of [futures markets](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md) is considered to be mainly in the transfer of risk, and increased [liquidity](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) between traders with different risk and time preferences, from a hedger to a speculator, for example.  

# Options on futures  

In many cases, options are traded on [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), sometimes called simply "[futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) options". A put is the option to sell a. [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract, and a call is the option to buy a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract. For both, the option [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) is the specified [futures price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) at which the future is traded if the option is exercised. See the [Black-Scholes model](../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md), which is the most. popular method for [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) these option contracts. [Futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) are often used since they are delta one instruments..  

# Futures contract regulations  

All [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) transactions in the United States are regulated by the [Commodity Futures](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md) Trading Commission (CFTC), an independent agency of the United States government. The Commission has the right to hand out fines and other punishments for an individual or company who breaks any rules. Although by law the commission regulates all transactions, each exchange can have its own rule, and under contract can fine companies for different things or extend the fine that the CFTC hands out.  

The CFTC publishes weekly reports containing details of the open interest of market participants for each market-segment that has more than 20 participants. These reports are released every Friday (including data from the previous Tuesday) and contain data on open interest split by reportable and non-reportable open interest as well as commercial and non-commercial open interest. This type of report is referred to as the 'Commitments of Traders Report', COT-Report or simply COTR.  

# Definition of futures contract  

Following Bjork'l1] we give a definition of a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract. We describe a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract with delivery of item J at the time T:  

There exists in the market a [quoted price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%201/Accrued%20Interest.md) $F(t,T)$ , which is known as the [futures price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) at time t for delivery of J at time T.   
.At time $T$ , the holder pays $F(T,T)$ and is entitled to receive J.   
: During any time interval $(s,t]$ , the holder receives the amount $F(t,T)-F(s,T)$   
:The spot price of obtaining the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is equal to zero, for all time $t$ such that $t<T$  

# Nonconvergence  

Some exchanges tolerate 'nonconvergence', the failure of [futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) and the value of the physical [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) they represent to reach the same value on '[contract settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Three-Month%20SOFR%20Futures.md)' day at the designated delivery points. An example of this is the CBOT (Chicago Board of Trade) Soft Red Winter wheat (SRw) [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). SRW [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) have settled more than $20\phi$ apart on settlement day and as much as $\$1.00$ difference between settlement days. Only a few participants holding CBOT SRW [futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) are qualified by the CBOT to make or receive delivery of [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) to settle [futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md). Therefore, it's impossible for almost any individual producer to 'hedge' efficiently when relying on the final settlement of a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract for SRW. The trend is for the CBOT to continue to restrict those. entities that can actually participate in settling [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contracts to those that can ship or receive large quantities of railroad cars and multiple barges at a few selected sites. The [Commodity Futures](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md) Trading Commission, which has oversight of the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) market in the United States, has made no comment as to why this trend is allowed to. continue since economic theory and CBOT publications maintain that convergence of contracts with the price of the. underlying commodity they represent is the basis of integrity for a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) market. It follows that the function of. 'price discovery', the ability of the markets to discern the appropriate value of a commodity reflecting current conditions, is degraded in relation to the discrepancy in price and the inability of producers to enforce contracts with the [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) they represent. 12]  

# Futures versus forwards  

While [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) and forward contracts are both contracts to deliver an asset on a future date at a prearranged price, they are different in two main respects:  

[Futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) are exchange-traded, while [forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) are traded over-the-counter. Thus [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) are standardized and face an exchange, while [forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) are customized and face a non-exchange counterparty.   
[Futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) are margined, while [forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) are not. Thus [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) have significantly less [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md), and have different funding.  

# Exchange versus OTC  

[Futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) are always traded on an exchange, whereas [forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) always trade over-the-counter, or can simply be a signed contract between two parties.  

Thus:  

[Futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) are highly standardized, being exchange-traded, whereas [forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) can be unique, being over-the-counter.   
:In the case of physical delivery, the [forward contract](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) specifies to whom to make the delivery. The counterparty. for delivery on a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is chosen by the clearing house..  

# Margining  

[Futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) are margined daily to the daily spot price of a forward with the same agreed-upon delivery price and [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) (based on [mark to market](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md)).  

[Forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) do not have a standard. They may transact only on the settlement date. More typical would be for the parties to agree to true up, for example, every quarter. The fact that [forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) are not margined daily means that, due to movements in the price of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md), a large differential can build up between the forward's delivery price and the settlement price, and in any event, an unrealized gain (loss) can build up.  

Again, this differs from [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) which get 'trued-up' typically daily by a comparison of the market value of the future to the collateral securing the contract to keep it in line with the brokerage [margin requirements](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Case%20Study%20Mf%20Globals%20Repo-To-Maturity%20Trades.md). This true-ing up occurs by the "loss" party providing additional collateral; so if the buyer of the contract incurs a drop in value, the shortfall or [variation margin](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Repurchase%20Agreements.md) would typically be shored up by the investor wiring or depositing additional cash in the brokerage account.  

In a forward though, the spread in exchange rates is not trued up regularly but, rather, it builds up as unrealized gain. (loss) depending on which side of the trade being discussed. This means that entire unrealized gain (loss) becomes realized at the [time of delivery](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Transactional%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets.md) (or as what typically occurs, the time the contract is closed prior to expiration) - assuming the parties must transact at the underlying [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)'s spot price to facilitate receipt/delivery..  

The result is that [forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) have higher [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) than [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), and that funding is charged differently.  

In most cases involving [institutional investors](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%204%20Institutional%20Trading.md), the daily [variation margin](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Repurchase%20Agreements.md) settlement guidelines for [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) call for actual money movement only above some insignificant amount to avoid wiring back and forth small sums of cash. The threshold amount for daily [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) [variation margin](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Repurchase%20Agreements.md) for [institutional investors](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%204%20Institutional%20Trading.md) is often $\$1,000$  

The situation for [forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md), however, where no daily true-up takes place in turn creates [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) for [forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md), but not so much for [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). Simply put, the risk of a [forward contract](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) is that the supplier will be unable to deliver the referenced asset, or that the buyer will be unable to pay for it on the delivery date or the date at which the opening party closes the contract.  

The margining of [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) eliminates much of this [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) by forcing the holders to update daily to the price of an. equivalent forward purchased that day. This means that there will usually be very little additional money due on the final day to settle the [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract: only the final day's gain or loss, not the gain or loss over the life of the. contract.  

In addition, the daily [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)-settlement failure risk is borne by an exchange, rather than an individual party, further limiting [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) in [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md).  

Example: Consider a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract with a $\$100$ price: Let's say that on day 50, a futures contract with a $\$100$ delivery price (on the same [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) as the future) costs $\$88$ . On day 51, that futures contract costs $\$90$ . This means that the "mark-to-market" calculation would require the holder of one side of the future to pay $\$2$ on day 51 to track the changes of the forward price ("post $\$2$ of margin"). This money goes, via [margin accounts](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Short%20Selling.md), to the holder of the other side of the future. That is, the loss party wires cash to the other party.  

A forward-holder, however, may pay nothing until settlement on the final day, potentially building up a large. balance; this may be reflected in the mark by an allowance for [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md). So, except for tiny effects of [convexity](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md). bias (due to earning or paying interest on margin), [futures and forwards](Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%201%20-%20Derivative%20Securities.md) with equal delivery prices result in the same total loss or gain, but holders of [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) experience that loss/gain in daily increments which track the forward's daily price changes, while the forward's spot price converges to the settlement price. Thus, while under [mark to market](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) accounting, for both assets the gain or loss accrues over the holding period; for a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) this gain or loss is realized. daily, while for a [forward contract](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) the gain or loss remains unrealized until expiry.  

Note that, due to the path dependence of funding, a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract is not, strictly speaking, a European derivative:. the total gain or loss of the trade depends not only on the value of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) at expiry, but also on the path of prices on the way. This difference is generally quite small though..  

With an exchange-traded future, the clearing house interposes itself on every trade. Thus there is no risk of counterparty default. The only risk is that the clearing house defaults (e.g. become bankrupt), which is considered very unlikely.

# Forward contract  

In finance, a [forward contract](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) or simply a forward is a non-standardized contract between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified future time at a price agreed today.] This is in contrast to a spot contract, which is an agreement to buy or sell an asset today. It costs nothing to enter a [forward contract](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md). The party agreeing to buy the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) in the future assumes a [long position](Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%204%20-%20Futures:%20Hedging%20and%20Speculation.md), and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future assumes a short position. The price agreed upon is called the delivery price, which is equal to the [forward price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) at the time the contract is entered into.  

The price of the underlying instrument, in whatever form, is paid before control of the instrument changes. This is one of the many forms of buy/sell orders where the time of trade is not the time where the securities themselves are exchanged.  

The [forward price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) of such a contract is commonly contrasted with the spot price, which is the price at which the asset changes hands on the spot date. The difference between the spot and the [forward price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) is the forward premium or forward discount, generally considered in the form of a profit, or loss, by the purchasing party..  

[Forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md), like other [derivative securities](Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md), can be used to hedge risk (typically [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) or [exchange rate risk](../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/PSET%203%20Financial%20Instruments.md)), as a. means of speculation, or to allow a party to take advantage of a quality of the underlying instrument which is time-sensitive.  

A closely related contract is a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract; they differ in certain respects. Forward contracts are very similar to. [futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md), except they are not exchange-traded, or defined on standardized asets.2] [Forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) also typically have no interim partial settlements or "true-ups" in [margin requirements](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2010/Case%20Study%20Mf%20Globals%20Repo-To-Maturity%20Trades.md) like [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) - such that the parties do not exchange additional property securing the party at gain and the entire unrealized gain or loss builds up while the contract is open. However, being traded OTC, forward contracts specification can be customized and may include mark-to-market and daily margining. Hence, a [forward contract](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) arrangement might call for the loss party to pledge collateral or additional collateral to better secure the party at gain.  

# Payoffs  

The value of a forward position at maturity depends on the relationship between the delivery price ( $K$ ) and the underlying price ( $S_{T}.$ ) at that time.  

.For a [long position](Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%204%20-%20Futures:%20Hedging%20and%20Speculation.md) this payoff is: $f_{T}=S_{T}-K$ .For a short position, it is:. $f_{T}=K-S_{T}$

# How a forward contract works  

Suppose that Bob wants to buy a house a year from now. At the same time, suppose that Andy currently owns a $\$100,000$ house that he wishes to sell a year from now. Both parties could enter into a forward contract with each. other. Suppose that they both agree on the sale price in one year's time of. $\$104,000$ (more below on why the sale price should be this amount). Andy and Bob have entered into a [forward contract](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md). Bob, because he is buying the. underlying, is said to have entered a [long forward](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%203%20Swaps-%20Financial%20Instruments/Forward%20Rates%20Agreement.md) contract. Conversely, Andy will have the [short forward contract](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forward%20Contracts%20on%20Exchange%20Rates.md).  

At the end of one year, suppose that the current market valuation of Andy's house is $\$110,000$ . Then, because Andy is obliged to sell to Bob for only $\$104,000$ , Bob will make a profit of. $\$6,000$ . To see why this is so, one needs only. to recognize that Bob can buy from Andy for. $\$104,000$ and immediately sell to the market for. $\$110,000$ . Bob has made the difference in profit. In contrast, Andy has made a potential loss of. $\$6,000$ , and an actual profit of. $\$4,000$  

The similar situation works among [currency forwards](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forward%20Contracts%20on%20Exchange%20Rates.md), where one party opens a [forward contract](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) to buy or sell a [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) (ex. a contract to buy Canadian dollars) to expire/settle at a future date, as they do not wish to be exposed to exchange rate/[currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) risk over a period of time. As the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars fluctuates between the trade date and the earlier of the date at which the contract is closed or the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md), one party gains and the counterparty loses as one [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) strengthens against the other. Sometimes, the buy forward is opened because the investor will actually need Canadian dollars at a future date such as to pay a debt owed that is denominated in Canadian dollars. Other times, the party opening a forward does so, not because they need Canadian dollars nor because they are [hedging currency risk](../Clippings/Forward%20Rate.md), but because they are speculating on the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md), expecting the exchange rate to move favorably to generate a gain on closing the contract.  

In a [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) forward, the [notional amounts](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) of currencies are specified (ex: a contract to buy. $\$100$ million Canadian dollars equivalent to, say $\$114.4$ million UsD at the current rate-these two amounts are called the notional. amount(s)). While the notional amount or reference amount may be a large number, the cost or margin requirement. to command or open such a contract is considerably less than that amount, which refers to the [leverage](../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) created,  

which is typical in derivative contracts.  

# Example of how forward prices should be agreed upon  

Continuing on the example above, suppose now that the initial price of Andy's house is $\$100,000$ and that Bob enters into a forward contract to buy the house one year from today. But since Andy knows that he can immediately sell for $\$100,000$ and place the proceeds in the bank, he wants to be compensated for the delayed sale. Suppose that the risk free rate of return R (the bank rate) for one year is $4\%$ . Then the money in the bank would grow to. $\$104,000$ , risk free. So Andy would want at least. $\$104,000$ one year from now for the contract to be worthwhile for him - the opportunity cost will be covered..  

# Spot - forward parity  

Spot-forward parity provides the link between the spot market and the [forward market](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md). It describes the relationship between the spot and [forward price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) in a [forward contract](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md). While the overall effect can be. described as the cost of carry, this effect can be broken down into different components, specifically whether the. asset:  

pays income, and if so whether this is on a discrete or continuous basis.   
incurs [storage costs](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Primary%20vs.%20Secondary%20Commodities.md)   
is regarded as an [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) asset, i.e. an asset held primarily for [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) purposes (e.g. gold, financial securities); or a consumption asset, i.e. an asset held primarily for consumption (e.g. oil, iron ore etc.).  

# Investment assets  

For an asset that provides no income, the relationship between the current forward ( $F_{0},$ ) and spot ( $S_{0},$ prices is  
$$
\begin{array}{r}{F_{0}=S_{0}e^{r T}}\end{array}
$$  

where $\pmb{\mathscr{r}}$ is the continuously compounded risk free rate of return, and $T$ is the [time to maturity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md). The intuition behind this result is that given you want to own the asset at time T, there should be no difference in a perfect capital market between buying the asset today and holding it and buying the [forward contract](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) and taking delivery. Thus, both approaches must cost the same in present value terms. For an [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) proof of why this is the case, see Rational [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) below.  

For an asset that pays known income, the relationship becomes:  

Discrete: $F_{0}=(S_{0}-I)e^{r T}$ Continuous: $F_{0}=S_{0}e^{(r-q)T}$  

where $I=I e^{r_{1}t_{1}}$ is the present value of the discrete income at time $t_{1}<T$ , and $q\%p.a$ is the [continuous dividend](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) yield over the life of the contract. The intuition is that when an asset pays income, there is a benefit to holding the asset rather than the forward because you get to receive this income. Hence the income ( $I$ or $q$ ) must be subtracted to reflect this benefit. An example of an asset which pays discrete income might be a stock, and example of an asset which pays a continuous yield might be a foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) or a [stock index](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md). For [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) assets which are [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), such as gold and silver, [storage costs](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Primary%20vs.%20Secondary%20Commodities.md) must also be considered. [Storage costs](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Primary%20vs.%20Secondary%20Commodities.md) can be treated as 'negative income', and like income can be discrete or continuous. Hence with storage. costs, the relationship becomes:  

Discrete: $F_{0}=(S_{0}+U)e^{r T}$ :Continuous: $F_{0}=S_{0}e^{(r+u)T}$  

where $U=U e^{r_{1}t_{1}}$ is the present value of the discrete storage cost at time $t_{1}\leq T$ , and $u\%p.a$ is the storage cost where it is proportional to the price of the commodity, and is hence a 'negative yield'. The intuition here is that because [storage costs](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Primary%20vs.%20Secondary%20Commodities.md) make the final price higher, we have to add them to the spot price.  

# Consumption assets  

Consumption assets are typically raw material [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) which are used as a source of energy or in a production process, for example crude oil or iron ore. Users of these consumption [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) may feel that there is a benefit from physically holding the asset in inventory as opposed to holding a forward on the asset. These benefits include. the ability to profit from temporary shortages and the ability to keep a production process running,' and are referred. to as the convenience yield. Thus, for consumption assets, the [spot-forward relationship](Trading%20the%20Fixed%20Income%20Inflation%20and%20Credit%20Markets.md) is:.  

Discrete [storage costs](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Primary%20vs.%20Secondary%20Commodities.md): $F_{0}=(S_{0}+U)e^{(r-y)T}$ Continuous [storage costs](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Primary%20vs.%20Secondary%20Commodities.md): $F_{0}=S_{0}e^{(r+u-y)T}$  

where $y\%p.a$ is the convenience yield over the life of the contract. Since the convenience yield provides a benefit to the holder of the asset but not the holder of the forward, it can be modelled as a type of 'dividend yield'. However, it is important to note that the convenience yield is a non cash item, but rather reflects the market's [expectations](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) concerning future availability of the commodity. If users have low inventories of the commodity, this implies a greater chance of shortage, which means a higher convenience yield. The opposite is true when high inventories exist.[1  

# Cost of carry  

The relationship between the spot and [forward price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) of an asset reflects the net cost of holding (or carrying) that. asset relative to holding the forward. Thus, all of the costs and benefits above can be summarised as the cost of carry, $c$ . Hence,  

Discrete: $F_{0}=(S_{0}+U-I)e^{(r-y)T}$ Continuous: $F_{0}=S_{0}e^{c T}$ , where $c=r-q+u-y$  

# Relationship between the forward price and the expected future spot price  

The market's opinion about what the spot price of an asset will be in the future is the expected [future spot price](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md)!l Hence, a key question is whether or not the current [forward price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) actually predicts the respective spot price in the future. There are a number of different hypotheses which. try to explain the relationship between the current [forward price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md), $F_{0}$ and the expected [future spot price](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md), $E(S_{T})$  

The economists John Maynard Keynes and John Hicks argued that in general, the natural hedgers of a commodity are those who wish to sell the commodity. at a future point in time.3 4] Thus,  

![](d4d3107c73b81adbcbae42cf8642029cd7d561ee2838ea04106247d4d4f0c872.jpg)  

hedgers will collectively hold a net short position in the [forward market](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md). The other side of these contracts are held by. speculators, who must therefore hold a net [long position](Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%204%20-%20Futures:%20Hedging%20and%20Speculation.md). Hedgers are interested in reducing risk, and thus will accept losing money on their forward contracts. Speculators on the other hand, are interested in making a profit, and will hence only enter the contracts if they expect to make money. Thus, if speculators are holding a net [long position](Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%204%20-%20Futures:%20Hedging%20and%20Speculation.md), it must be the case that the expected [future spot price](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) is greater than the [forward price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md).  

In other words, the expected payoff to the speculator at maturity is:  
$E(S_{T}-K)=E(S_{T})-K$ , where $K$ is the delivery price at maturity  

Thus, if the speculators expect to profit, $\begin{array}{l}{E(S_{T})-K>0}\ {E(S_{T})>K}\end{array}$ $E(S_{T})>F_{0}$ , as $K=F_{0}$ when they enter the contract  

This market situation, where $E(S_{T})>F_{0}$ , is referred to as normal backwardation. Since forward/[futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) prices converge with the spot price at maturity (see Basis), normal backwardation implies that [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) prices for a certain maturity are increasing over time. The opposite situation, where $E(S_{T})<F_{0}$ , is referred to as contango. Likewise, contango implies that [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) prices for a certain maturity are falling over time.15]  

# Rational pricing  

If $S_{t}$ is the spot price of an asset at time $t$ , and $\pmb{\mathscr{r}}$ is the [continuously compounded rate](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Arithmetic%20and%20Geometric%20Rates%20of%20Return.md), then the [forward price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) at a future time $T$ must satisfy $F_{t,T}=S_{t}e^{r(T-t)}$  

To prove this, suppose not. Then we have two possible cases.  

Case 1: Suppose that $F_{t,T}>S_{t}e^{r(T-t)}$ . Then an investor can execute the following trades at time $t$  

1. go to the bank and get a loan with amount $S_{t}$ at the [continuously compounded rate](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Arithmetic%20and%20Geometric%20Rates%20of%20Return.md) r;   
2. with this money from the bank, buy one unit of stock for $S_{t}$   
3. enter into one [short forward contract](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forward%20Contracts%20on%20Exchange%20Rates.md) costing O. A [short forward contract](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forward%20Contracts%20on%20Exchange%20Rates.md) means that the investor owes the counterparty the stock at time $T$  

The initial cost of the trades at the initial time sum to zero.  

At time $T$ the investor can reverse the trades that were executed at time $t$ . Specifically, and mirroring the trades 1.,.   
2. and 3. the investor   
1. ' repays the loan to the bank. The inflow to the investor is $-S_{t}e^{\tau(T-t)}$   
2. ' settles the [short forward contract](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forward%20Contracts%20on%20Exchange%20Rates.md) by selling the stock for $F_{t,T}$ . The cash inflow to the investor is now $F_{t,T}$ because the buyer receives $S_{T}$ from the investor. The sum of the inflows in 1.' and 2. equals $F_{t,T}-S_{t}e^{r(T-t)}$ , which by hypothesis, is positive. This is an [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) profit. Consequently, and assuming that the non-[arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) condition holds, we have a contradiction. This is called a [cash and carry](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Cash-And-Carry%20Arbitrage.md) [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) because you "carry" the stock until maturity.   
Case 2: Suppose that $F_{t,T}<S_{t}e^{r(T-t)}$ . Then an investor can do the reverse of what he has done above in case 1. But if you look at the convenience yield page, you will see that if there are finite stocks/inventory, the reverse cash. and [carry arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Cash-And-Carry%20Arbitrage.md) is not always possible. It would depend on the elasticity of demand for forward contracts and such like.  

# Extensions to the forward pricing formula  

Suppose that $F V_{T}(X)$ is the time value of cash flows $\boldsymbol{\mathrm X}$ at the contract expiration time $T$ . The [forward price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) is then given by the formula:  
$F_{t,T}=S_{t}e^{r(T-t)}-F V_{T}$ (All cash flows over the life of the contract) The cash flows can be in the form of dividends from the asset, or costs of maintaining the asset.  

If these price relationships do not hold, there is an [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) opportunity for a riskless profit similar to that discussed above. One implication of this is that the presence of a [forward market](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md) will force [spot prices](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md) to reflect current [expectations](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) of future prices. As a result, the [forward price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) for nonperishable [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), securities or [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) is no more a predictor of future price than the spot price is - the relationship between forward and [spot prices](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md) is driven by [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md). For perishable [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) does not have this  

The above [forward pricing formula](../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/PSET%201-Financial%20Instruments.md) can also be written as:  
$$
F_{t,T}=(S_{t}-I_{t})e^{r(T-t)}
$$  

Where $I_{t}$ is the time t value of all cash flows over the life of the contract.  

For more details about [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md), see [forward price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md).  

# Theories of why a forward contract exists  

Allaz and Vila (1993) suggest that there is also a strategic reason (in an imperfect competitive environment) for the existence of forward trading, that is, forward trading can be used even in a world without uncertainty. This is due to firms having Stackelberg incentives to anticipate their production through forward contracts.

# Option (finance)  

In finance, an option is a derivative financial instrument that establishes a contract between two parties concerning. the buying or selling of an asset at a reference price. The buyer of the option gains the right, but not the obligation, to. engage in some specific transaction on the asset, while the seller incurs the obligation to fulfill the transaction if so. requested by the buyer. The price of an option derives from the difference between the reference price and the value. of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) (commonly a stock, a bond, a [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) or a [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract) plus a premium based on the time remaining until the expiration of the option. Other types of options exist, and options can in principle be created for any type of valuable asset.  

An option which conveys the right to buy something is called a call; an option which conveys the right to sell is called a put. The reference price at which the underlying may be traded is called the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) or [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md). The process of activating an option and thereby trading the underlying at the agreed-upon price is referred to as exercising it. Most options have an [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). If the option is not exercised by the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md), it becomes void and worthless.  

In return for granting the option, called writing the option, the originator of the option collects a payment, the. premium, from the buyer. The writer of an option must make good on delivering (or receiving) the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) or its cash equivalent, if the option is exercised..  

An option can usually be sold by its original buyer to another party. Many options are created in standardized form and traded on an anonymous options exchange among the general public, while other over-the-counter options are customized to the desire of the buyer on an ad hoc basis usually by an [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) bank [ 2]  

# Option valuation  

The theoretical value of an option is evaluated according to any of several mathematical models. These models, which are developed by quantitative analysts, attempt to predict how the value of an option changes in response to changing conditions. For example how the price changes with respect to changes in [time to expiration](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) or how an increase in volatility would have an impact on the value. Hence, the risks associated with granting, owning, or trading options may be quantified and managed with a greater degree of precision, perhaps, than with some other investments. Exchange-traded options form an important class of options which have standardized contract features. and trade on public exchanges, facilitating trading among independent parties. Over-the-counter options are traded between private parties, often well-capitalized institutions that have negotiated separate trading and clearing arrangements with each other.  

# Contract specifications  

Every financial option is a contract between the two counterparties with the terms of the option specified in a term sheet. Option contracts may be quite complicated; however, at minimum, they usually contain the following specifications:[3]  

.whether the option holder has the right to buy (a call option) or the right to sell (a put option)   
:the quantity and class of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md)(s) (e.g. 100 shares of XYZ Co. B stock).   
:the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md), also known as the [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md), which is the price at which the underlying transaction will occur. upon exercise   
. the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md), or expiry, which is the last date the option can be exercised.   
the settlement terms, for instance whether the writer must deliver the actual asset on exercise, or may simply. tender the equivalent cash amount   
the terms by which the option is quoted in the market to convert the [quoted price](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%201/Accrued%20Interest.md) into the actual premium--the total amount paid by the holder to the writer of the option..  

# Types  

The primary types of financial options are:  

.Exchange-traded options (also called "listed options") are a class of exchange-traded [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md). Exchange traded options have standardized contracts, and are settled through a clearing house with fulfillment guaranteed by the credit of the exchange. Since the contracts are standardized, accurate [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) models are often available. Exchange-traded options include:[4] [5]  

stock options,   
commodity options,   
bond options and other interest rate options   
[stock market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) index options or, simply, index options and   
options on [futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md)   
callable bull/bear contract  

:Over-the-counter options (OTC options, also called "dealer options") are traded between two private parties, and are not listed on an exchange. The terms of an OTC option are unrestricted and may be individually tailored to meet any business need. In general, at least one of the counterparties to an OTC option is a well-capitalized. institution. Option types commonly traded over the counter include:  

1. interest rate options   
2. [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) cross rate options, and   
3. options on swaps or swaptions.  

# Other option types  

Another important class of options, particularly in the U.S., are employee stock options, which are awarded by a company to their employees as a form of incentive compensation. Other types of options exist in many [financial contracts](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md), for example real estate options are often used to assemble large parcels of land, and prepayment options are usually included in mortgage loans. However, many of the valuation and [risk management](Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) principles apply. across all financial options.  

# Option styles  

Naming conventions are used to help identify properties common to many different types of options. These include:  

European option - an option that may only be exercised on expiration. :American option - an option that may be exercised on any trading day on or before expiry. Bermudan option - an option that may be exercised only on specified dates on or before expiration. Barrier option - any option with the general characteristic that the underlying security's price must pass a certain level or "barrier" before it can be exercised : [Exotic](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Exotic%20Interest%20Rate%20Options.md) option - any of a broad category of options that may include complex financial structures.16] :Vanilla option - any option that is not [exotic](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Exotic%20Interest%20Rate%20Options.md).  

# Valuation models  

The value of an option can be estimated using a variety of quantitative techniques based on the concept of [risk neutral pricing](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%2010-%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives.md) and using [stochastic calculus](6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md). The most basic model is the [Black-Scholes model](../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md). More sophisticated models are used to model the volatility smile. These models are implemented using a variety of numerical techniques.7] In general, standard option valuation models depend on the following factors:  

The current market price of the underlying security,   
.the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) of the option, particularly in relation to the current market price of the underlier (in the money vs. out of the money),   
.the cost of holding a position in the underlying security, including interest and dividends,.   
: the [time to expiration](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) together with any restrictions on when exercise may occur, and an estimate of the future volatility of the underlying security's price over the life of the option..  

More advanced models can require additional factors, such as an estimate of how volatility changes over time and for various underlying price levels, or the dynamics of [stochastic interest rates](Appendices/Appendix%205.C%20Forward%20And%20Futures%20Prices%20When%20Interest%20Rates%20Are%20Random.md)..  

The following are some of the principal valuation techniques used in practice to evaluate option contracts.  

# Black-Scholes  

Following early work by Louis Bachelier and later work by Edward O. Thorp, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes made a major breakthrough by deriving a differential equation that must be satisfied by the price of any derivative dependent on a non-dividend-paying stock. By employing the technique of constructing a [risk neutral](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%207-Exotic%20Options%20And%20Derivative%20Pricing%20By%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation.md) [portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) that replicates the [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) of holding an option, Black and Scholes produced a closed-form solution for a European. option's theoretical price.8 At the same time, the model generates hedge parameters necessary for effective [risk management](Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) of option holdings. While the ideas behind the [Black-Scholes model](../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md) were ground-breaking and. eventually led to Scholes and [Merton](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%205.md) receiving the Swedish Central Bank's associated Prize for Achievement in Economics (a.k.a., the Nobel Prize in Economics),[9] the application of the model in actual options trading is clumsy. because of the assumptions of continuous (or no) dividend payment, constant volatility, and a constant interest rate. Nevertheless, the [Black-Scholes model](../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md) is still one of the most important methods and foundations for the existing financial market in which the result is within the reasonable range. to]  

# Stochastic volatility models  

Since the market crash of 1987, it has been observed that market [implied volatility](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/A%20Real-Life%20Option%20Pricing%20Exercise.md) for options of lower strike prices are typically higher than for higher strike prices, suggesting that volatility is stochastic, varying both for time and for the price level of the underlying security. [Stochastic volatility](../Course%20Notes/Python/QuantLib-Python/Valuing%20European%20Option%20Using%20the%20Heston%20Model%20in%20QuantLib%20Python.md) models have been developed including one developed by S.L. [Heston](Mathematical%20Modeling%20of%20Derivative%20Pricing.md).[1] One principal advantage of the [Heston model](../Course%20Notes/Python/QuantLib-Python/Valuing%20European%20Option%20Using%20the%20Heston%20Model%20in%20QuantLib%20Python.md) is that it can be solved in closed-form, while other [stochastic volatility](../Course%20Notes/Python/QuantLib-Python/Valuing%20European%20Option%20Using%20the%20Heston%20Model%20in%20QuantLib%20Python.md) models require complex numerical methods.11]  

# Model implementation  

Once a valuation model has been chosen, there are a number of different techniques used to take the mathematical models to implement the models.  

# Analytic techniques  

In some cases, one can take the mathematical model and using analytical methods develop closed form solutions such as [Black-Scholes](Mathematical%20Modeling%20of%20Derivative%20Pricing.md) and the [Black model](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Black%20Models%20for%20Bond%20Price%20Options%20Capsfloors.md). The resulting solutions are readily computable, as are their "[Greeks](Derivatives/Part%20V%20-%20Options%20Pricing/Chapter%2026%20-%20Pricing%20Options:%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation.md)".  

# Binomial tree pricing model  

Closely following the derivation of Black and Scholes, John Cox, Stephen Ross and Mark Rubinstein developed the original version of the [binomial](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/A%20Real-Life%20Option%20Pricing%20Exercise.md) options [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) model.12] [13] It models the dynamics of the option's theoretical value for discrete time intervals over the option's [duration](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md). The model starts with a [binomial tree](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Rate%20and%20Price%20Trees.md) of discrete future. possible underlying stock prices. By constructing a riskless [portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of an option and stock (as in the [Black-Scholes model](../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md)) a simple formula can be used to find the option price at each node in the tree. This value can approximate the. theoretical value produced by [Black Scholes](../Credit%20Markets/Black-Scholes%20Model.md), to the desired degree of precision. However, the [binomial model](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%204-Multiperiod%20Binomial%20Trees/Binomial%20Option%20Pricing.md) is. considered more accurate than [Black-Scholes](Mathematical%20Modeling%20of%20Derivative%20Pricing.md) because it is more flexible, e.g. discrete future [dividend payments](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) can. be modeled correctly at the proper forward time steps, and American options can be modeled as well as European. ones. [Binomial](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/A%20Real-Life%20Option%20Pricing%20Exercise.md) models are widely used by professional option traders. The Trinomial tree is a similar model,. allowing for an up, down or stable path; although considered more accurate, particularly when fewer time-steps are modelled, it is less commonly used as its implementation is more complex.  

# Monte Carlo models  

For many classes of options, traditional valuation techniques are intractable due to the complexity of the instrument. In these cases, a [Monte Carlo](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%207-Exotic%20Options%20And%20Derivative%20Pricing%20By%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation.md) approach may often be useful. Rather than attempt to solve the differential equations of motion that describe the option's value in relation to the underlying security's price, a [Monte Carlo](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%207-Exotic%20Options%20And%20Derivative%20Pricing%20By%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation.md) model uses simulation to generate random price paths of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md), each of which results in a payoff for the option. The average of these payoffs can be discounted to yield an expectation value for the option.14] Note though, that despite its flexibility, using simulation for American styled options is somewhat more complex than for lattice based models.  

# Finite difference models  

The equations used to model the option are often expressed as partial differential equations (see for example. [Black-Scholes PDE](../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md)). Once expressed in this form, a finite difference model can be derived, and the valuation obtained. A number of implementations of finite difference methods exist for option valuation, including: explicit. finite difference, implicit finite difference and the Crank-Nicholson method. A trinomial tree option [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) model can be shown to be a simplified application of the explicit finite difference method. Although the Finite difference approach is mathematically sophisticated, it is particularly useful where changes are assumed over time in model inputs - for example dividend yield, risk free rate, or volatility, or some combination of these - that are not tractable in closed form.  

# Other models  

Other numerical implementations which have been used to value options include finite element methods. Additionally, various [short rate](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/An%20Overview%20of%20the%20Vasicek%20Short%20Rate%20Model.md) models have been developed for the valuation of interest rate [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), bond options and swaptions. These, similarly, allow for closed-form, lattice-based, and simulation-based modelling, with corresponding advantages and considerations.  

# Risks  

As with all securities, trading options entails the risk of the option's value changing over time. However, unlike traditional securities, the return from holding an option varies non-linearly with the value of the underlier and other factors. Therefore, the risks associated with holding options are more complicated to understand and predict.  

In general, the change in the value of an option can be derived from [Ito's lemma](Determining%20the%20Stochastic%20Process%20for%20a%20Forward%20Contract%20from%20Itoâ€™s%20Lemma.md) as:  
$$
d C=\Delta d S+\Gamma{\frac{d S^{2}}{2}}+\kappa d\sigma+\theta d t
$$  

where [the Greeks](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Options%20Greeks.md). $\Delta,\Gamma$ $\kappa$ and $\theta$ are the standard hedge parameters calculated from an option valuation model, such as [Black-Scholes](Mathematical%20Modeling%20of%20Derivative%20Pricing.md), and $d S,d\sigma$ and $d t$ are unit changes in the underlier price, the underlier [volatility and time](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/The%20Futures-Forward%20Difference.md), respectively.  

Thus, at any point in time, one can estimate the risk inherent in holding an option by calculating its hedge parameters and then estimating the expected change in the model inputs, $d S,d\sigma$ and $d t$ , provided the changes in these. values are small. This technique can be used effectively to understand and manage the risks associated with standard options. For instance, by offsetting a holding in an option with the quantity. $-\Delta$ of shares in the underlier, a trader. can form a [delta neutral](Derivatives/Part%20VI%20-%20The%20Greeks/Chapter%2027%20-%20Delta%20Hedging.md) [portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) that is hedged from loss for small changes in the underlier price. The. corresponding [price sensitivity](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Duration.md) formula for this [portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). $\Pi$ is:  
$$
d\Pi=\Delta d S+\Gamma\frac{d S^{2}}{2}+\kappa d\sigma+\theta d t=\Gamma\frac{d S^{2}}{2}+\kappa d\sigma+\theta d t
$$  

# Example  

A call option expiring in 99 days on 100 shares of XYZ stock is struck at $\$50$ , with XYZ currently trading at $\$48$ With future realized volatility over the life of the option estimated at $25\%$ , the theoretical value of the option is $\$1.89$ The hedge parameters $\Delta,\Gamma,\kappa,\theta$ are (0.439, 0.0631, 9.6, and -0.022), respectively. Assume that on the following day, XYZ stock rises to $\$48.5$ and volatility falls to $23.5\%$ . We can calculate the estimated value of the call option by applying the hedge parameters to the new model inputs as:  
$$
d C=(0.439\cdot0.5)+\left(0.0631\cdot{\frac{0.5^{2}}{2}}\right)+(9.6\cdot-0.015)+(-0.022\cdot1)=0.0614
$$  

Under this scenario, the value of the option increases by $\$0.0614$ to $\$1.9514$ , realizing a profit of. $\$6.14$ . Note that for a delta neutral portfolio, where by the trader had also sold 44 shares of XYZ stock as a hedge, the net loss under the same scenario would be $(\$15.86)$  

# Pin risk  

A special situation called pin risk can arise when the underlier closes at or very close to the option's strike value on the last day the option is traded prior to expiration. The option writer (seller) may not know with certainty whether or not the option will actually be exercised or be allowed to expire worthless. Therefore, the option writer may end up with a large, unwanted residual position in the underlier when the markets open on the next trading day after expiration, regardless of their best efforts to avoid such a residual.  

# Counterparty risk  

A further, often ignored, risk in [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) such as options is counterparty risk. In an option contract this risk is that the seller won't sell or buy the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) as agreed. The risk can be minimized by using a financially strong intermediary able to make good on the trade, but in a major panic or crash the number of defaults can overwhelm. even the strongest intermediaries.  

# Trading  

The most common way to trade options is via standardized options contracts that are listed by various [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) and options exchanges. (15] Listings and prices are tracked and can be looked up by ticker symbol. By publishing continuous, live markets for option prices, an exchange enables independent parties to engage in price discovery and execute transactions. As an intermediary to both sides of the transaction, the benefits the exchange provides to the transaction include:  

.fulfillment of the contract is backed by the credit of the exchange, which typically has the highest rating (AAA),   
counterparties remain anonymous,   
enforcement of [market regulation](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%205%20Regulation%20of%20Trading.md) to ensure fairness and transparency, and maintenance of orderly markets, especially during fast trading conditions.  

Over-the-counter options contracts are not traded on exchanges, but instead between two independent parties. Ordinarily, at least one of the counterparties is a well-capitalized institution. By avoiding an exchange, users of OTC options can narrowly tailor the terms of the option contract to suit individual business requirements. In addition, OTC option transactions generally do not need to be advertised to the market and face little or no regulatory requirements. However, OTC counterparties must establish credit lines with each other, and conform to each others [clearing and settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%203%20Financial%20Market%20Utilities.md) procedures.  

With few exceptions 6] there are no secondary markets for employe stock options. These must ether be exercised by the original grantee or allowed to expire worthless..  

# The basic trades of traded stock options (American style)  

These trades are described from the point of view of a speculator. If they are combined with other positions, they can also be used in [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md). An option contract in US markets usually represents 100 shares of the underlying security.[17]  

# Long call  

A trader who believes that a stock's price will increase might buy the right to purchase the stock (a call option) rather than just purchase the stock itself. He would have no obligation to buy the stock, only the right to do so until the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). If the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) at expiration is above the [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md) by more than the premium (price) paid, he will profit. If the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) at expirationn. is lower than the [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md), he will let the call contract expire worthless, and only lose the amount of the premium. A trader might buy the option instead of shares, because for the same amount of money, he can control ([leverage](../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md)) a much larger number of shares.

# Long put  

A trader who believes that a stock's price will decrease can buy the right to sell the stock at a fixed price (a put option). He will be under no obligation to sell the stock, but has the right to do so until the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). If the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) at expiration is below the [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md) by more than the premium paid, he will profit. If the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) at expiration is above the [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md), he will let the put contract expire worthless and only lose the premium paid.

# Short call  

A trader who believes that a [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) will decrease, can sell the stock short or instead sell, or "write," a call. The trader selling a call has an obligation to sell the stock to the call buyer at the buyer's option. If the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) decreases, the short call position will make a profit in the amount of the premium. If the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md). increases over the [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md) by more than the amount of the premium, the short will lose money, with the potential loss unlimited.

# Short put  

A trader who believes that a [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) will increase can buy the stock or instead sell a put. The trader selling a put has an obligation to buy the stock from the put buyer at the put buyer's option. If the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) at expiration is above the [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md), the short put position will make a profit in the amount of the. premium. If the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) at expiration is below the exercise. price by more than the amount of the premium, the trader will lose money, with the potential loss being up to the full value of the stock. A benchmark index for the performance of a cash-secured short put option position is the CBOE S&P 500 PutWrite Index (ticker PUT).

# Option strategies  

Combining any of the four basic kinds of option trades (possibly. with different exercise prices and maturities) and the two basic kinds of stock trades (long and short) allows a variety of options. strategies. Simple strategies usually combine only a few trades, while more complicated strategies can combine several..  

Strategies are often used to engineer a particular risk profile to movements in the underlying security. For example, buying a butterfly spread (long one X1 call, short two X2 calls, and long one X3 call) allows a trader to profit if the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) on the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) is near the middle [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md), X2, and does not expose the trader to a large loss.  

![](f05c65934fd9b73ff418750f520b2700f2bd7f4779d2700895fc7d67d6178e9c.jpg)  

Payoffs from buying a butterfly spread.  

An Iron condor is a strategy that is similar to a butterfly spread,. but with different strikes for the short options - offering a larger. likelihood of profit but with a lower net credit compared to the butterfly spread.  

Selling a straddle (selling both a put and a call at the same [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md)) would give a trader a greater profit than a butterfly if the final [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) is near the [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md), but might result in a large loss.  

![](ab233b410f0d3bb61194e6e2c8d06b06c5ceec5b837432056d00bae8c508ca21.jpg)  
Payoffs from selling a straddle.  

Similar to the straddle is the strangle which is also constructed by. a call and a put, but whose strikes are different, reducing the net debit of the trade, but also reducing the likelihood of profit in the trade.  

One well-known strategy is the [covered call](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2018%20-%20Stock%20Options%20and%20Stock%20Index%20Options.md), in which a trader buys a stock (or holds a previously-purchased long stock position), and sells a call. If the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) rises above the [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md), the call will be exercised and the trader will get a fixed profit. If the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) falls, the trader will lose money on his stock position, but this will be partially offset by the premium received from selling the call. Overall, the payoffs match the payoffs from selling a put. This relationship is known as [put-call parity](7.%20Black%20Scholes%20Model.md) and offers insights for financial theory. A benchmark index for the performance of a buy-write strategy is the CBOE S&P 500 BuyWrite Index (ticker symbol BXM).

# Historical uses of options  

Contracts similar to options are believed to have been used since ancient times. In the real estate market, call options have long been used to assemble large parcels of land from separate owners, e.g. a developer pays for the right to buy several adjacent plots, but is not obligated to buy these plots and might not unless he can buy all the plots in the entire parcel. Film or theatrical producers often buy the right - but not the obligation - to dramatize a specific book or script. Lines of credit give the potential borrower the right - but not the obligation -- to borrow within a specified time period.  

Many choices, or embedded options, have traditionally been included in bond contracts. For example many bonds are convertible into common stock at the buyer's option, or may be called (bought back) at specified prices at the issuer's option. Mortgage borrowers have long had the option to repay the loan early, which corresponds to a callable bond option.  

In London, puts and "refusals" (calls) first became well-known trading instruments in the 1690s during the reign of William and Mary 18]  

Privileges were options sold over the counter in nineteenth century America, with both puts and calls on shares offered by specialized dealers. Their [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md) was fixed at a rounded-off market price on the day or week that the option was bought, and the expiry date was generally three months after purchase. They were not traded in secondary markets.  

Supposedly the first option buyer in the world was the ancient Greek mathematician and philosopher Thales of Miletus. On a certain occasion, it was predicted that the season's olive harvest would be larger than usual, and during the off-season he acquired the right to use a number of olive presses the following spring. When spring came and the olive harvest was larger than expected he exercised his options and then rented the presses out at much higher price than he paid for his 'option'.[19] [20]

# Call option  

A call option, often simply labeled a "call", is a financial contract between two parties, the buyer and the seller of this type of option. The buyer of the call option has the right, but not the obligation to buy an agreed quantity of a. particular commodity or financial instrument (the underlying) from the seller of the option at a certain time (the. [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md)) for a certain price (the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md)). The seller (or "writer") is obligated to sell the commodity or financial instrument should the buyer so decide. The buyer pays a fee (called a premium) for this right..  

The buyer of a call option wants the price of the underlying instrument to rise in the future; the seller either expects that it will not, or is willing to give up some of the upside (profit) from a price rise in return for the premium (paid immediately) and retaining the opportunity to make a gain up to the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) (see below for examples).  

Call options are most profitable for the buyer when the underlying instrument moves up, making the price of the underlying instrument closer to, or above, the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md). The call buyer believes it's likely the price of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) will rise by the exercise date. The risk is limited to the premium. The profit for the buyer can be very large, and is limited by how high underlying's spot rises. When the price of the underlying instrument surpasses the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md), the option is said to be "in the money".  

The call writer does not believe the price of the underlying security is likely to rise. The writer sells the call to collect the premium. The total loss, for the call writer, can be very large, and is only limited by how high the underlying's spot price rises.  

The initial transaction in this context (buying/selling a call option) is not the supplying of a physical or financial. asset (the underlying instrument). Rather it is the granting of the right to buy the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md), in exchange for a fee - the option price or premium.  

Exact specifications may differ depending on option style. A European call option allows the holder to exercise the option (i.e., to buy) only on the option [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). An American call option allows exercise at any time during the life of the option.  

Call options can be purchased on many [financial instruments](../Financial%20Instruments/A%20Practical%20Guide%20for%20Actuaries%20and%20other%20Business%20Professionals..md) other than stock in a corporation. Options can be purchased on [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) on [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md), for example (see interest rate cap), and on [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) like gold or crude oil. A tradeable call option should not be confused with either Incentive stock options or with a warrant. An incentive stock option, the option to buy stock in a particular company, is a right granted by a corporation to a particular person (typically executives) to purchase treasury stock. When an incentive stock option is exercised, new shares are issued. Incentive stock options are not traded on the open market. In contrast, when a call option is exercised, the. [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) is transferred from one owner to another..  

# Example of a call option on a stock  

An investor typically 'buys a call' when he expects the price of the underlying instrument will go above the call's '[strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md),'. hopefully significantly so, before the call expires. The investor pays a non-refundable premium for the legal right to exercise the call at the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md), meaning he can purchase the underlying instrument at the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md). Typically, if the price of the underlying instrument has surpassed the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md), the buyer pays the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) to actually purchase the underlying instrument, and then sells the instrument and pockets the profit. Of course, the investor can also hold onto the underlying instrument, if he feels it will continue to climb even higher.

Payoff from buying a call  

An investor typically 'writes a call' when he expects the price of the underlying instrument to stay below the call's [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md). The writer (seller) receives the premium up front as his or her profit. However, if the call buyer decides to exercise his option to buy, then the writer has the obligation to sell the underlying instrument at the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md). Oftentimes the writer of the call does not actually own the underlying instrument, and must purchase it on the open market in order to be able to sell it to the buyer of the call. The seller of the call will lose the difference between his or her purchase price of the underlying instrument and the strike. price. This risk can be huge if the underlying instrument skyrockets unexpectedly in price.

Payoff from writing a call.  

.The current price of ABC Corp stock is $\$45$ per share, and investor 'Chris' expects it will go up significantly. Chris buys a call contract for 100 shares of ABC Corp from 'Steve, who is the call writer/seller. The strike price for the contract is $\$50$ per share, and Chris pays a premium up front of. $\$5$ per share, or $\$500$ total. If ABC Corp does not go up, and Chris does not exercise the contract, then Chris has lost $\$500$   
:ABC Corp stock subsequently goes up to $\$60$ per share before the contract is expired. Chris exercises the call option by buying 100 shares of ABC from Steve for a total of $\$5,000$ . Chris then sells the stock on the market at. market price for a total of $\$6,000$ . Chris has paid a $\$500$ contract premium plus a stock cost of $\$5,000$ , for a total of $\$5,500$ . He has earned back $\$6,000$ yielding a net profit of $\$500$ . Steve, however, did not do so well. Steve did not already own ABC Corp stock, so when Chris exercised the contract, Steve had to buy the stock on the open market for $\$6,000$ . Steve had already earned the $\$500$ premium for the contract and $\$5,000$ from Chris on selling the stock, so the total loss for Steve was $\$500$   
:If, however, the ABC [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) drops to $\$40$ per share by the time the contract expires, Chris will not exercise the option (i.e., Chris will not buy a stock at. $\$50$ per share from Steve when he can buy it on the open market at $\$40$ per share). Chris loses his premium, a total of $\$500$ . Steve, however, keeps the premium with no other out-of-pocket expenses, making a profit of $\$500$   
.The break-even [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) for Chris is $\$55$ per share, i.e., the $\$50$ per share for the call option price plus the $\$5$ per share premium he paid for the option. If the stock reaches $\$55$ per share when the option expires, Chris can recover his [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) by exercising the option and buying 100 shares of ABC Corp stock from Steve at $\$50$ per share, and then immediately selling those shares at the market price of $\$55$ . His total costs are then the $\$5$ per share premium for the call option, plus $\$50$ per share to buy the shares from Steve, for a total of $\$5,500$ . His total earnings are $\$55$ per share sold, or $\$5,500$ for 100 shares, yielding him a net $\$0$ (Note that this does not take into account broker fees or other transaction costs.)  

# Value of a call  

This examples lead to the following formal reasoning. Fix $\mathcal{O}$ an underlying financial instrument. Let. $\Pi$ be a call option for this instrument, purchased at time 0, expiring at time. $T\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$ , with exercise (strike) price $K\in\mathbb{R}$ .. and let $S:[0,T]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be the price of the underlying instrument.   
Assume the owner of the option $\Pi$ , wants to make no loss, and does not want to actually possess the underlying. instrument, $\mathcal{O}$ . Then either (i) the person will exercise the option and purchase $\mathcal{O}$ , and then immediately sell it; or (ii) the person will not exercise the option (which subsequently becomes worthless). In (i), the pay-off would be $-K+S_{T}$ ; in (ii) the pay-off would be 0. So if $S_{T}-K\geq0\mathrm{(i)}$ or (ii) occurs; if $S_{T}-K<0$ then (ii) occurs.  

Hence the pay-off, i.e. the value of the call option at expiry, is  
$\operatorname*{max}(S_{T}-K,0)$ which is also written $\ensuremath{\left(S_{T}-K\right)}\lor0\$ or $\large(S_{T}-K\large)^{+}$  

# Price of options  

Option values vary with the value of the underlying instrument over time. The price of the call contract must reflect the "likelihood" or chance of the call finishing "in-the-money." The call contract price generally will be higher when the contract has more time to expire (except in cases when a significant dividend is present) and when the underlying. financial instrument shows more volatile. Determining this value is one of the central functions of [financial mathematics](Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md). The most common method used is the [Black-Scholes formula](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%205.md). Whatever the formula used, the buyer and seller must agree on the initial value (the premium or price of the call contract), otherwise the exchange. (buy/sell) of the call will not take place..

# Put option  

A put option (usually just called a "put") is a financial contract between two parties, the writer (seller) and the buyer of the option. The buyer acquires a short position by purchasing the right to sell the underlying instrument to the seller of the option for a specified price (the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md)) during a specified period of time. If the option buyer. [exercises](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) his right, the seller is obligated to buy the underlying instrument from him at the agreed-upon [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md), regardless of the current market price. In exchange for having this option, the buyer pays the seller or option writer a. fee (the option premium).  

By providing a guaranteed buyer and price for an underlying instrument (for a specified span of time), put options offer insurance against excessive loss. Similarly, the seller of put options profits by selling options that are not exercised. Such is the case when the ongoing market value of the underlying instrument makes the option unnecessary; i.e. the market value of the instrument remains above the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) during the option contract period.  

Purchasers of put options may also profit from the ability to sell the underlying instrument at an inflated price (relative to the current market value) and repurchase their position at the much reduced current market price.  

# Instrument models  

The terms for exercising the option's right to sell it differ depending on option style. A European put option allows the holder to exercise the put option for a short period of time right before expiration, while an American put option allows exercise at any time before expiration.  

The most widely-traded put options are on equities, but they are traded on many other instruments such as [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) (see interest rate floor) or [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md).  

The put buyer either believes that the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md)'s price will fall by the exercise date or hopes to protect a long.   
position in it. The advantage of buying a put over short selling the asset is that the option owner's risk of loss is limited to the premium paid for it, whereas the asset short seller's risk of loss is unlimited (its price can rise greatly,.   
in fact, in theory it can rise infinitely, and such a rise is the short seller's loss.) The put buyer's prospect (risk) of gain.   
is limited to the option's [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) less the underlying's spot price and the premium/fee paid for it..  

The put writer believes that the underlying security's price will rise, not fall. The writer sells the put to collect the premium. The put writer's total potential loss is limited to the put's [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) less the spot and premium already received. Puts can be used also to limit the writer's [portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) risk and may be part of an option spread.  

A naked put, also called an uncovered put, is a put option whose writer (the seller) does not have a position in the. underlying stock or other instrument. This strategy is best used by investors who want to accumulate a position in the. underlying stock, but only if the price is low enough. If the buyer fails to exercise the options, then the writer keeps the option premium as a 'gift' for playing the game..  

If the underlying stock's market price is below the option's [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) when expiration arrives, the option owner (buyer) can exercise the put option, forcing the writer to buy the underlying stock at the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md). That allows the exerciser (buyer) to profit from the difference between the stock's market price and the option's [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md). But if the stock's market price is above the option's [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) at the end of expiration day, the option expires worthless, and the owner's loss is limited to the premium (fee) paid for it (the writer's profit).  

The seller's potential loss on a naked put can be substantial. If the stock falls all the way to zero (bankruptcy), his. loss is equal to the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) (at which he must buy the stock to cover the option) minus the premium received. The. potential upside is the premium received when selling the option: if the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) is above the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) at. expiration, the option seller keeps the premium, and the option expires worthless. During the option's lifetime, if the. stock moves lower, the option's premium may increase (depending on how far the stock falls and how much time passes). If it does, it becomes more costly to close the position (repurchase the put, sold earlier), resulting in a loss. If. the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) completely collapses before the put position is closed, the put writer potentially can face catastrophic  

loss.  

# Example of a put option on a stock  

Buying a put  

A Buyer thinks the price of a stock will decrease. He pays a premium which he will never get back, unless it is sold before it expires. The buyer has the right to sell the stock at the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md).  

Writing a put  

The writer receives a premium from the buyer. If the buyer. [exercises](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) his option, the writer will buy the stock at the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md). If the buyer does not exercise his option, the writer's profit is. the premium.  

Trader A' (Put Buyer) purchases a put contract to sell 100 shares of XYZ Corp. to 'Trader. $\mathbf{B}^{\prime}$ (Put Writer) for. $\$50$ per share. The current price is $\$55$ per share, and 'Trader. $\mathrm{A}'$ pays a premium of $\$5$ per share. If the price of XYZ stock falls to. $\$40$ a share right before expiration, then 'Trader. $\mathrm{A}^{\prime}$ can exercise the put by buying 100 shares for $\$4,000$ from the stock market,. then selling them to 'Trader $\mathrm{\bfB^{\prime}}$ for $\$5,000$  

Trader A's total earnings (S) can be calculated at $\$500$ . The sale of the 100 shares of stock at a strike price of $\$50$ to 'Trader $\mathbf{B}^{\prime}=\$5,000$ (P). The purchase of 100 shares of stock at $\$40$ (Q). The put option premium paid to trader

B for buying the contract of 100 shares at $\$5$ per share, excluding commissions $=\$500$ $(\mathbf{R})$ . Thus $\mathbf{S}=\mathbf{P}$ $\mathbf{(Q+R)}=\mathbb{5}\pm\mathbf{5},\mathbf{0}\mathbf{0}\mathbf{0}-(\mathbb{5}4,\mathbf{0}\mathbf{0}\mathbf{0}+\mathbb{5}\pm\mathbf{5}\mathbf{0}\mathbf{0})=\mathbb{5}\pmb{5}\mathbf{0}\mathbf{0}.$  

If, however, the share price never drops below the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) (in this case,. $\$50$ , then 'Trader A' would not.   
exercise the option (because selling a stock to 'Trader $\mathbf{B}^{\prime}$ at $\$50$ would cost 'Trader A' more than that to buy it)..   
Trader A's option would be worthless and he would have lost the whole [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), the fee (premium) for the option contract, $\$500$ (5 per share, 100 shares per contract). Trader A's total loss are limited to the cost of the put.   
premium plus the sales commission to buy it..  

A put option is said to have intrinsic value when the underlying instrument has a spot price (S) below the option's [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) $(\mathbf{K})$ . Upon exercise, a put option is valued at K-S if it is "in-the-money", otherwise its value is zero. Prior. to exercise, an option has time value apart from its intrinsic value. The following factors reduce the time value of a put option: shortening of the time to expire, decrease in the volatility of the underlying, and increase of [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md). Option [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) is a central problem of [financial mathematics](Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md).  

# Value of a put  

This examples lead to the following formal reasoning. Fix $\mathcal{O}$ an underlying financial instrument. Let $\Pi$ be a put option for this instrument, purchased at time $0$ , expiring at time $T\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$ , with exercise (strike) price $K\in\mathbb{R}$ and let $S:[0,T]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be the price of the underlying instrument.  

Assume the owner of the option. $\Pi$ , wants to make no loss, and does not want to actually possess the underlying instrument, $\mathcal{O}$ . Then either (i) the person will purchase $\mathcal{O}$ at expiry, and then immediately exercise the selling option; or (ii) the person will not exercise the option (which subsequently becomes worthless). In (i), the pay-off would be $-S_{T}+K$ ; in (ii) the pay-off would be 0. So if $K-S_{T}\geq0\mathrm{(i)}$ or (ii) occurs; if. $K-S_{T}<0$ then (ii) occurs.  

Hence the pay-off, i.e. the value of the put option at expiry, is  
$$
\left|\operatorname*{max}\{K-S_{T},0\right\}
$$  

# {{{}}  

which is alternatively written $(K-S_{T})\vee0$ or $(K-S_{T})^{+}$

# Strike price  

In options, the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) (or [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md) ) is a key variable in a [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) contract between two parties. Where the contract requires delivery of the underlying instrument, the trade will be at the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md), regardless of the spot price (market price) of the underlying instrument at that time..  

Formally, the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) can be defined as the fixed price at which the owner of an option can purchase (in the case of a call), or sell (in the case of a put), the underlying security or commodity..  

For example, an IBM May 50 Call has a [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) of $\$50$ a share. When the option is exercised the owner of the option will buy 100 shares of IBM stock for $\$50$ per share.  

# Moneyness  

Moneyness is a term describing the relationship between the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) of an option and the current trading price of its underlying security. Where settlement is financial, the difference between the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) and the spot price will. determine the value, or "moneyness", of the contract..  

In options trading, terms such as in-the-money, at-the-money and out-of-the-money describe the moneyness of.   
options. A call option is said to be in-the-money if the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) is trading above the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md). A put option is in-the-money if the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) is higher than the market price of the underlying stock. A call or put option is.   
at-the-money if the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) and the [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md) are the same. A call option is said to be out-of-the-money if the.   
[stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) is lower than the [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md) of the option. A put option is out-of-the money if the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) is higher.   
than the [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md) of the option.  

# Mathematical Formula  

A call option has positive monetary value at expiration when the underlying has a spot price (S) above the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md) $(\mathbf{K})$ . Since the option will not be exercised unless it is in-the-money, the payoff for a call option is  
$\operatorname*{max}\left[(S-K);0\right]$ also written as  
$$
(S-K)^{+}
$$  

where  
$$
(x)^{+}=\{_{0}^{x}\quad_{x<0}^{x\geq0}\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad}
$$  

A put option has positive monetary value at expiration when the underlying has a spot price below the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md); it is "out-the-money" otherwise, and will not be exercised. The payoff is therefore:.  
$$
m a x\left[(K-S);0\right]
$$  

or  
$$
(K-S)^{+}
$$  

For a digital option payoff is $1_{S\geq K}$ , where $1_{\{\}}$ is the indicator function.

# Swap (finance)  

In finance, a swap is a derivative in which counterparties exchange certain benefits of one party's financial instrument for those of the other party's financial instrument. The benefits in question depend on the type of [financial instruments](../Financial%20Instruments/A%20Practical%20Guide%20for%20Actuaries%20and%20other%20Business%20Professionals..md) involved. For example, in the case of a swap involving two bonds, the benefits in question can be the periodic interest (or coupon) payments associated with the bonds. Specifically, the two counterparties agree to exchange one stream of cash flows against another stream. These streams are called the legs of the swap. The swap agreement defines the dates when the cash flows are to be paid and the way they are calculated. Usually at the time when the contract is initiated at least one of these series of cash flows is determined by a random or uncertain variable such as an interest rate, foreign exchange rate, equity price or commodity price.1]  

The cash flows are calculated over a [notional principal](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%204%20-%20Swap%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Swaps.md) amount, which is usually not exchanged between counterparties. Consequently, swaps can be in cash or collateral..  

Swaps can be used to hedge certain risks such as [interest rate risk](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md), or to speculate on changes in the expected direction of underlying prices.  

The first swaps were negotiated in the early 1980s.ll David Swensen, a Yale Ph.D. at [Salomon Brothers](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Understanding%20The%20Yield%20Curve-%20Part%201.md), engineered the first swap transaction according to "When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of [Long-Term Capital Management](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Turmoil%20in%20Financial%20Markets%20the%20Risk%20Business.md)" by Roger Lowenstein.

# Swap market  

Most swaps are traded over-the-counter (OTC), "tailor-made" for the counterparties. Some types of swaps are also. exchanged on [futures markets](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md) such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc., the largest U.S. [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) market, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, IntercontinentalExchange and Frankfurt-based Eurex AG.

Usually, at least one of the legs has a rate that is variable. It can depend on a reference rate, the total return of a swap, an economic statistic, etc. The most important criterion is that it comes from an independent third party, to avoid any conflict of interest. For instance, LIBOR is published by the British Bankers Association, an independent trade body.  

# Types of swaps  

The five generic types of swaps, in order of their quantitative importance, are: interest rate swaps, [currency swaps](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md), credit swaps, commodity swaps and equity swaps. There are also many other types.  

# Interest rate swaps  

The most common type of swap is a "plain Vanilla' [interest rate swap](Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md). It is the exchange of a fixed rate loan to a floating rate loan. The life of the swap can range from 2 years to over 15 years. The reason for this exchange is to take benefit from comparative advantage. Some companies may have comparative advantage in fixed rate markets while other companies have a comparative advantage in floating rate markets. When companies want to borrow they look for cheap borrowing. i.e. from the market where they have comparative advantage. However this may lead to a company borrowing.  

![](070fbd819eeae29d169cdf1db2dcfc1195b2fb288d11eabb056c5b8bddca5160.jpg)  

A is currently paying floating, but wants to pay fixed. B is currently paying fixed but wants to pay floating. By entering into an [interest rate swap](Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md), the net result is that each party can 'swap' their existing obligation for their desired obligation. Normally the parties do not swap payments directly, but rather, each sets up a separate swap with a financial intermediary such as a bank. In return for matching the two parties together, the bank takes a spread from the swap payments.  

fixed when it wants floating or borrowing floating when it wants fixed. This is where a swap comes in. A swap has the effect of transforming a fixed rate loan into a floating rate loan or vice versa.[currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).  

For example, party B makes periodic interest payments to party A based on a variable interest rate of LIBOR $+70$ basis points. Party A in return makes periodic interest payments based on a fixed rate of $8.65\%$ . The payments are calculated over the notional amount. The first rate is called variable, because it is reset at the beginning of each [interest calculation](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Slides%20On%20Repurchase%20Agreements.md) period to the then current reference rate, such as LIBOR. In reality, the actual rate received by A  

and B is slightly lower due to a bank taking a spread.  

# Currency swaps  

A [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) swap involves exchanging principal and fixed rate interest payments on a loan in one [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) for principal and fixed rate interest payments on an equal loan in another [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). Just like interest rate swaps, the [currency swaps](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md) also are motivated by comparative advantage. [Currency swaps](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md) entail swapping both principal and interest between the parties, with the cashflows in one direction being in a different [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) than those in the opposite direction.  

# Commodity swaps  

A commodity swap is an agreement whereby a floating (or market or spot) price is exchanged for a fixed price over a specified period. The vast majority of commodity swaps involve crude oil..  

# Equity Swap  

An [equity swap](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%204%20-%20Swap%20Markets/Equity%20Commodity%20and%20Exotic%20Swaps.md) is a special type of total return swap, where the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) is a stock, a basket of stocks, or a [stock index](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md). Compared to actually owning the stock, in this case you do not have to pay anything up front, but you. do not have any voting or other rights that stock holders do..  

# Credit default swaps  

A [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) (CDS) is a [swap contract](../Financial%20Instruments/Review%20Session%20Notes/Currency%20Swaps.md) in which the buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments to the seller and, in exchange, receives a payoff if a credit instrument - typically a bond or loan - goes into default (fails to pay). Less commonly, the [credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) that triggers the payoff can be a company undergoing restructuring, bankruptcy or even just having its credit rating downgraded. CDS contracts have been compared with insurance, because the buyer pays a premium and, in return, receives a sum of money if one of the events specified in the contract occur. Unlike an actual insurance contract the buyer is allowed to profit from the contract and may also cover an asset to which the buyer has no direct exposure.  

# Other variations  

There are myriad different variations on the vanilla swap structure, which are limited only by the imagination of financial engineers and the desire of corporate treasurers and fund managers for [exotic](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Exotic%20Interest%20Rate%20Options.md) structures.1]  

.A total return swap is a swap in which party A pays the total return of an asset, and party B makes periodic interest payments. The total return is the capital gain or loss, plus any interest or [dividend payments](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md). Note that if the total return is negative, then party A receives this amount from party B. The parties have exposure to the return of the underlying stock or index, without having to hold the underlying assets. The profit or loss of party B is the same for him as actually owning the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md)..   
An option on a swap is called a swaption. These provide one party with the right but not the obligation at a future time to enter into a swap.   
.A [variance swap](Variance%20Swaps.md) is an over-the-counter instrument that allows one to speculate on or hedge risks associated with. the magnitude of movement, a CMS, is a swap that allows the purchaser to fix the [duration](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of received flows on a. Swap.   
:An Amortising swap is usually an [interest rate swap](Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) in which the [notional principal](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%204%20-%20Swap%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Swaps.md) for the interest payments declines during the life of the swap, perhaps at a rate tied to the prepayment of a mortgage or to an interest rate benchmark such as the LIBOR. It is suitable to those customers of banks who want to manage the [interest rate risk](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) involved in predicted funding requirement, or [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) programs.   
. A Zero coupon swap is of use to those entities which have their liabilities denominated in floating rates but at the same time would like to conserve cash for operational purposes..   
.A Deferred rate swap is particularly attractive to those users of funds that need funds immedatiely but do not consider the current rates of interest very attractive and feel that the rates may fall in future..   
: An Accreting swap is used by banks which have agreed to lend increasing sums over time to its customers so that they may fund projects.   
:A [Forward swap](Derivatives/Part%20IX%20-%20Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Chapter%2039%20-%20Swaptions,%20Forward%20Swaps,%20and%20MBS.md) is an agreement created through the synthesis of two swaps differing in [duration](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) for the purpose of fulfilling the specific time-frame needs of an investor. Also referred to as a forward start swap, delayed start swap, and a deferred start swap.  

# Valuation  

The value of a swap is the net present value (NPV) of all estimated [future cash flows](Advanced%20Derivatives%20Pricing%20Methodology.md). A swap is worth zero when it is first initiated, however after this time its value may become positive or negative.ll There are two ways to value swaps: in terms of bond prices, or as a portfoliof forward contracts.1]  

# Using bond prices  

While principal payments are not exchanged in an [interest rate swap](Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md), assuming that these are received and paid at the end of the swap does not change its value. Thus, from the point of view of the floating-rate payer, a swap position in a fixed-rate bond (i.e. receiving fixed interest payments), and a short position in a floating rate note (i.e. making. floating interest payments):  
$$
V_{s w a p}=B_{f i x e d}-B_{f l o a t i n g}
$$  

From the point of view of the fixed-rate payer, the swap can be viewed as having the opposite positions. That is,  
$$
V_{s w a p}=B_{f l o a t i n g}-B_{f i x e d}
$$  

Similarly, [currency swaps](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md) can be regarded as having positions in bonds whose cash flows correspond to those in the swap. Thus, the home [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) value is:  
$V_{s w a p}=B_{d o m e s t i c}-S_{0}B_{f o r e i g n} $ where $B_{d o m e s t i c}$ is the domestic cash flows of the swap, $B_{f o r e i g n}$ the foreign cash flows of the LIBOR is the rate of interest offered by banks on deposit from other banks in the [eurocurrency](../International%20Finance/The%20Eurocurrency%20and%20Eurobond%20Markets%20Annotations.md) market. One-month LIBOR is the rate offered for 1-month deposits, 3-month LIBOR for three months deposits, etc.  

LIBOR rates are determined by trading between banks and change continuously as [economic conditions](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%20(2007â€“2011).md) change. Just like the prime rate of interest quoted in the domestic market, LIBOR is a reference rate of interest in the International Market.  

# Arbitrage arguments  

As mentioned, to be [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) free, the terms of a [swap contract](../Financial%20Instruments/Review%20Session%20Notes/Currency%20Swaps.md) are such that, initially, the NPV of these [future cash flows](Advanced%20Derivatives%20Pricing%20Methodology.md) is equal to zero. Where this is not the case, [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) would be possible..  

For example, consider a plain vanilla fixed-to-floating [interest rate swap](Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) where Party A pays a fixed rate, and Party. B pays a floating rate. In such an agreement the fixed rate would be such that the present value of future fixed rate payments by Party A are equal to the present value of the expected future floating rate payments (i.e. the NPV is zero). Where this is not the case, an Arbitrageur, C, could:.  

1. assume the position with the lower present value of payments, and borrow funds equal to this present value   
2. meet the [cash flow](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) obligations on the position by using the borrowed funds, and receive the corresponding. payments - which have a higher present value   
3. use the received payments to repay the debt on the borrowed funds   
4. pocket the difference - where the difference between the present value of the loan and the present value of the inflows is the [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) profit.  

Subsequently, once traded, the price of the Swap must equate to the price of the various corresponding instruments as mentioned above. Where this is not true, an arbitrageur could similarly short sell the overpriced instrument, and use the proceeds to purchase the correctly priced instrument, pocket the difference, and then use payments generated to service the instrument which he is short.

# Interest rate derivative  

An [interest rate derivative](../Clippings/Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives.md) is a derivative where the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) is the right to pay or receive a notional amount of money at a given interest rate. These structures are popular for investors with customized cashflow needs or specific views on the interest rate movements (such as volatility movements or simple directional movements) and are therefore usually traded OTC; see financial engineering.  

The interest rate [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) market is the largest [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) market in the world. The Bank for International Settlements estimates that the notional amount outstanding in June 2009 [1] were $\mathrm{US}\$437$ trillion for OTC interest. rate contracts, and. ${\mathrm{USS}}342$ trillion for OTC interest rate swaps. According to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association,e $80\%$ of the world's top 500 companies as of April 2003 used interest rate derivatives to control their cashflows. This compares with $75\%$ for foreign exchange options, $25\%$ for commodity options and $10\%$ for stock options.e  

Modeling of interest rate [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) is usually done on a time-dependent multi-dimensional Lattice ("tree") built for the underlying risk drivers, usually domestic or foreign short rates and Forex rates; see Short-rate model. Specialised simulation models are also often used.  

# Types  

# Vanilla  

The basic building blocks for most interest rate [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) can be described as "vanilla" (simple, basic derivative structures, usually most liquid):  

[Interest rate swap](Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) (fixed-for-floating)   
Interest rate cap or interest rate floor   
Interest rate swaption Bond option [Forward rate](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) agreement   
Interest rate future   
Money market instruments  

Cross [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) swap (see Forex swap)  

# Quasi-vanilla  

The next intermediate level is a quasi-vanilla class of (fairly liquid) [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), examples of which are:  

Range accrual swaps/notes/bonds   
In-arrears swap   
Constant maturity swap (CMS) or constant treasury swap (CTS) [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) (swaps, caps, [floors](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Caps%20and%20Floors.md))   
[Interest rate swap](Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) based upon two floating [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md)  

# Exotic derivatives  

Building off these structures are the "[exotic](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Exotic%20Interest%20Rate%20Options.md)" interest rate [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) (least liquid, traded over the counter), such as:

Most of the [exotic](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Exotic%20Interest%20Rate%20Options.md) interest rate [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) are structured as swaps or notes, and can be classified as having two payment legs: a funding leg and an [exotic](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Exotic%20Interest%20Rate%20Options.md) coupon leg.  

.A funding leg usually consists of series of fixed coupons or floating coupons (LIBOR) plus fixed spread. . An [exotic](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Exotic%20Interest%20Rate%20Options.md) coupon leg typically consists of a functional dependence on the past and current underlying indices (LIBOR, CMS rate, FX rate) and sometimes on its own past levels, as in Snowballs and TARNs. The payer of the [exotic](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Exotic%20Interest%20Rate%20Options.md) coupon leg usually has a right to cancel the deal on any of the coupon payment dates, resulting in the so-called Bermudan exercise feature. There may also be some range-accrual and knock-out features inherent in the [exotic](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Exotic%20Interest%20Rate%20Options.md) coupon definition.  

# Example of interest rate derivatives  

# Interest rate cap  

An interest rate cap is designed to hedge a company's maximum exposure to upward interest rate movements. It establishes a maximum total dollar interest amount the hedger will pay out over the life of the cap. The interest rate cap is actually a series of individual interest rate caplets, each being an individual option on the underlying interest rate index. The interest rate cap is paid for upfront, and then the purchaser realizes the benefit of the cap over the life of the instrument.  

# Range accrual note  

Suppose a manager wished to take a view that volatility of [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) will be low. He or she may gain extra yield. over a regular bond by buying a range accrual note instead. This note pays interest only if the floating interest rate. (i.e.[London Interbank Offered Rate](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Short-Term%20Rates%20and%20the%20Transition%20from%20LIBOR.md)) stays within a pre-determined band. This note effectively contains an embedded option which, in this case, the buyer of the note has sold to the issuer. This option adds to the yield of the note. In this way, if volatility remains low, the bond yields more than a standard bond..  

# Bermudan swaption  

Suppose a fixed-coupon callable bond was brought to the market by a company. The issuer however, entered into an [interest rate swap](Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) to convert the fixed [coupon payments](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) to floating payments (perhaps based on LIBOR). Since it is callable however, the issuer may redeem the bond back from investors at certain dates during the life of the bond. If called, this would still leave the issuer with the [interest rate swap](Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md). Therefore, the issuer also enters into Bermudan swaption when the bond is brought to market with exercise dates equal to callable dates for the bond. If the bond is called, the swaption is exercised, effectively canceling the swap leaving no more [interest rate exposure](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2013%20-%20Banks%20Asset-Liability%20Management/Duration%20Gap%20Management.md) for the issuer.

# Credit derivative  

In finance, a credit derivative is a securitized derivative whose value is derived from the [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) on an underlying bond, loan or any other financial asset. In this way, the [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) is on an entity other than the. counterparties to the transaction itsel.] This entity is known as the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) and may be a corporate, a. sovereign or any other form of legal entity which has incurred debt.2] [Credit derivatives](../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) are bilateral contracts. between a buyer and seller under which the seller sells protection against the [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) of the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md).[2]  

Stated in plain language, a credit derivative is a wager, and the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) is the thing being wagered on. Similar to placing a bet at the racetrack, where the person placing the bet does not own the horse or the track or have. anything else to do with the race, the person buying the credit derivative doesn't necessarily own the bond (the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md)) that is the object of the wager. He or she simply believes that there is a good chance that the bond or collateralized debt obligation (CDO) in question will default (go to zero value). Originally conceived as a kind of. insurance policy for owners of bonds or CDO's, it evolved into a freestanding [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) strategy. The cost might be. as low as $1\%$ per year. If the buyer of the derivative believes the underlying bond will go bust within a year (usually. an extremely unlikely event) the buyer stands to reap a 100 fold profit. A small handful of investors anticipated the. credit crunch of 2007/8 and made billions placing "bets" via this method..  

The parties will select which credit events apply to a transaction and these usually consist of one or more of the following:  

bankruptcy (the risk that the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) will become bankrupt)   
.failure to pay (the risk that the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) will default on one of its obligations such as a bond or loan)   
obligation default (the risk that the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) will default on any of its obligations) obligation acceleration (the risk that an obligation of the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) will be accelerated e.g. a bond will be declared immediately due and payable following a default) repudiation/moratorium (the risk that the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) or a government will declare a moratorium over the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md)'s obligations) restructuring (the risk that obligations of the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) will be restructured)...  

Where credit protection is bought and sold between bilateral counterparties, this is known as an unfunded credit derivative. If the credit derivative is entered into by a financial institution or a [special purpose vehicle](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations.md) (SPV) and. payments under the credit derivative are funded using [securitization](10.%20Other%20Topics%20in%20Quantitative%20Finance.md) techniques, such that a debt obligation is issued. by the financial institution or SPV to support these obligations, this is known as a funded credit derivative..  

This synthetic [securitization process](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%206%20Mortgage%20Backed%20Securities.md) has become increasingly popular over the last decade, with the simple versions of these structures being known as synthetic CDOs; credit linked notes; single tranche CDOs, to name a few. In funded [credit derivatives](../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md), transactions are often rated by rating agencies, which allows investors to take different  

slices of [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) according to their risk appetite.  

# Market size and participants  

Credit default products are the most commonly traded credit derivative product'3] and include unfunded products such as credit default swaps and funded products such as [collateralized debt obligations](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%205.md) (see further discussion below).  

The ISDA!4| reported in April 2007 that total notional amount on outstanding [credit derivatives](../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) was $\$35.1$ trillion with a gross market value of $\$948$ billion (ISDA's Website [5]). As reported in The Times on September 15, 2008, the "Worldwide [credit derivatives](../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) market i valued at \$62 trillion". [6]  

Although the [credit derivatives](../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) market is a global one, London has a market share of about $40\%$ , with the rest of Europe having about 10% [3]  

The main market participants are banks, [hedge funds](Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md), insurance companies, pension funds, and other corporates.3]  

# Types  

[Credit derivatives](../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) are fundamentally divided into two categories: funded [credit derivatives](../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) and unfunded credit. [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md). An unfunded credit derivative is a bilateral contract between two counterparties, where each party is responsible for making its payments under the contract (i.e. payments of premiums and any cash or [physical settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Futures%20and%20Forwards.md) amount) itself without recourse to other assets. A funded credit derivative involves the [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md). (the party that assumes the [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md)) making an initial payment that is used to settle any potential credit events. However, the [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) is exposed to the [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) of the [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md), in which case the [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) fails to pay the [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) under the event of the [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md)'s default. It is also known as counterparty. risk.

# Key unfunded credit derivative products  

# Credit default swap  

The [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) or CDS has become the cornerstone product of the [credit derivatives](../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) market. This product represents over thirty percent of the [credit derivatives](../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) market3]  

A [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md), in its simplest form (the unfunded single name [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md)) is a bilateral contract between a [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) and a [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md). The [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) will reference the creditworthiness of a third party called a [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md): this will usually be a corporate or sovereign. The [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) will relate to the specified debt obligations of the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md): perhaps its bonds and loans, which fulfill certain pre-agreed characteristics. The [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) will pay a periodic fee to the [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) in return for a contingent payment by the seller upon a [credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) affecting the obligations of the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) specified in the transaction.  

The relevant credit events specified in a transaction will usually be selected from amongst the following:  

:The bankruptcy of the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md);   
:Its failure to pay in relation to a covered obligation;.   
:It defaulting on an obligation or that obligation being accelerated;   
: It agreeing to restructure a covered obligation or a repudiation or moratorium being declared over any covered obligation.  

If any of these events occur and the [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) serves a [credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) notice on the [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) detailing the [credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) as well as (usually) providing some publicly available information validating this claim, then the transaction will settle.  

This means that, in the case of a physically settled transaction, the [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) can deliver an amount of the.   
[reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md)'s defaulted obligations to the [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md), in return for their full face value (notwithstanding that.   
they are now worth far less). In the case of a cash settled transaction, a relevant obligation of the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) will be valued and the [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) will pay the [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) the full face value of the reference obligation less its.   
current value (i.e. compensating the [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) for the decline in the obligation's creditworthiness)..  

Credit default swaps have unique characteristics that distinguish them from insurance products and financial guaranties. The [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) does not need to own an underlying obligation of the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md). The [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) does not need to suffer a loss.  

Since the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) is not a party to agreement between the [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) and seller, the seller of protection. has no inherent recourse to the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) in the event of default and no right to sue the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) for recovery. However, if the transaction were to be physically settled the seller of protection could derive a right to take. action against the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) on the basis of the loan or securities acquired during the settlement process..  

The product has many variations, including where there is a basket or [portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of reference entities, although fundamentally, the principles remain the same. A powerful recent variation has been gathering market share of late: credit default swaps which relate to [asset-backed](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) securities[7l  

# Total return swap  

A total return swap (also known as Total Rate of Return Swap) is a contract between two counterparties whereby they swap periodic payments for the period of the contract. Typically, one party receives the total return (interest payments plus any capital gains or losses for the payment period) from a specified reference asset, while the other receives a specified fixed or floating [cash flow](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) that is not related to the creditworthiness of the reference asset, as with a vanilla [Interest rate swap](Primer%20on%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md). The payments are based upon the same notional amount. The reference asset may be any asset, index or basket of assets.  

The TRS is simply a mechanism that allows one party to derive the economic benefit of owning an asset without use of the balance sheet, and which allows the other to effectively "buy protection" against loss in value due to ownership of a credit asset.  

The essential difference between a total return swap and a [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) is that the [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) provides protection against specific credit events. The total return swap protects against the loss of value irrespective of cause, whether default, widening of credit spreads or anything else i.e. it isolates both [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) and [market risk](Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%205%20-%20Index%20Futures.md).  

# Key funded credit derivative products  

# Credit linked notes  

A credit linked note is a note whose [cash flow](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) depends upon an event, which may be a default, change in [credit spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md), or rating change. The definition of the relevant credit events must be negotiated by the parties to the note.  

A CLN in effect combines a credit-default swap with a regular note (with coupon, maturity, redemption). Given its note like features, a CLN is an on-balance-sheet asset, in contrast to a CDS.  

Typically, an [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) fund manager will purchase such a note to hedge.  

against possible down grades, or loan defaults.  

![](ad308e30f6c469f2ef7ff4043f64b52e3b5722fe5ca369e59b91b7cf6e8a7cf5.jpg)  

In this example coupons from the bank's [portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of loans are passed to the SPV which uses the [cash flow](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) to service the credit linked notes..  

Numerous different types of credit linked notes (CLNs) have been structured and placed in the past few years. Here we are going to provide an [overview](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Overview%20of%20Financial%20Markets.md) rather than a detailed account of these instruments.  

The most basic CLN consists of a bond, issued by a well-rated borrower, packaged with a [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) on a less creditworthy risk.  

For example, a bank may sell some of its exposure to a particular emerging country by issuing a bond linked to that country's default or convertibility risk. From the bank's point of view, this achieves the purpose of reducing its.   
exposure to that risk, as it will not need to reimburse all or part of the note if a [credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) occurs. However, from.   
the point of view of investors, the risk profile is different from that of the bonds issued by the country. If the bank.   
runs into difficulty, their investments will suffer even if the country is still performing well..  

The credit rating is improved by using a proportion of government bonds, which means the CLN investor receives an enhanced coupon.  

Through the use of a [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md), the bank receives some recompense if the reference credit defaults.  

There are several different types of securitized product, which have a credit dimension. CLN is a generic name related to any bond whose value is linked to the performance of a reference asset, or assets. This link may be through the use of a credit derivative, but does not have to be.  

Credit-linked notes CLN: Credit-linked note is a generic name related to any bond whose value is linked to the performance of a reference asset, or assets. This link may be through the use of a credit derivative, but does not have to be.   
Collateralized debt obligation CDO: Generic term for a bond issued against a mixed pool of assets - There also exists CDO-squared $(\mathbf{CDO}^{\wedge}2)$ where the underlying assets are CDO tranches.   
Collateralized bond obligations CBO: Bond issued against a pool of bond assets or other securities. It is referred. to in a generic sense as a CDO  

:Collateralized loan obligations CLO: Bond issued against a pool of bank loan. It is referred to in a generic sense as a CDO  

CDO refers either to the pool of assets used to support the CLNs or, confusingly, to the CLNs themselves.  

# Collateralized debt obligations (CDO)  

[Collateralized debt obligations](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%205.md) (CDOs) are a form of credit derivative offering exposure to a large number of companies in a single instrument. This exposure is sold in slices of varying risk or subordination - each slice is known as a tranche.  

In a cashflow CDO, the underlying credit risks are bonds or loans held by the issuer. Alternatively in a [synthetic CDO](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Cred.md), the exposure to each underlying company is a [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md). A [synthetic CDO](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Cred.md) is also referred to as CSO. Other more complicated CDOs have been developed where each underlying [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) is itself a CDO tranche. These CDOs are commonly known as CDOs-squared.  

# Pricing  

[Pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) of credit derivative is not an easy process. This is because:  

.The complexity in monitoring the market price of the underlying credit obligation..   
:Understanding the creditworthiness of a debtor is often a cumbersome task as it is not easily quantifiable..   
. The incidence of default is not a frequent phenomenon and makes it difficult for the investors to find the empirical data of a solvent company with respect to default.   
: Even though one can take help of different ratings published by ranking agencies but often these ratings will be. different.  

# Risks  

Risks involving [credit derivatives](../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) are a concern among regulators of [financial markets](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md). The US Federal Reserve. issued several statements in [the Fall](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Fall%20of%20Bear%20Stearns%20Lost%20Opportunities%20Haunt%20Final%20Days%20of%20Bear%20Stearns;%20Executives%20Bickeredover%20Raising%20Cash%20Cutting%20Mortgages.md) of 2005 about these risks, and highlighted the growing backlog of confirmations. for [credit derivatives](../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) trades. These backlogs pose risks to the market (both in theory and in all likelihood), and they. exacerbate other risks in the [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md). One challenge in regulating these and other [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) is that the people who know most about them also typically have a vested incentive in encouraging their growth and lack of regulation. incentive may be indirect, e.g., academics have not only consulting incentives, but also incentives in. keeping open doors for research.)

# Equity derivative  

In finance, an equity derivative is a class of [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) whose value is at least partly derived from one or more underlying equity securities. Options and [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) are by far the most common equity [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), however there are many other types of equity [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) that are actively traded.  

# Equity options  

Equity options are the most common type of equity derivative. They provide the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a quantity of stock (1 contract $=100$ shares of stock), at a set price ([strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md)), within a. certain period of time (prior to the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md))..  

# Warrants  

In finance, a warrant is a security that entitles the holder to buy stock of the company that issued it at a specified price, which is much lower than the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) at time of issue. Warrants are frequently attached to bonds or. preferred stock as a sweetener, allowing the issuer to pay lower [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) or dividends. They can be used to. enhance the yield of the bond, and make them more attractive to potential buyers..  

# Convertible bonds  

Convertible bonds are bonds that can be converted into shares of stock in the issuing company, usually at some pre-announced ratio. It is a hybrid security with debt- and equity-like features. It can be used by investors to obtain the upside of equity-like [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) while protecting the downside with regular bond-like coupons.  

# Equity futures, options and swaps  

Investors can gain exposure to the [equity markets](An%20Introduction%20to%20Equity%20Markets.md) using [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), options and swaps. These can be done on single stocks, a customized basket of stocks or on an index of stocks. These equity [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) derive their value from the price of the underlying stock or stocks.  

# Stock market index futures  

[Stock market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) index [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) are [futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) used to replicate the performance of an underlying [stock market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md). index. They can be used for [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) against an existing equity position, or speculating on future movements of the. index. Indices for [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) include well-established indices such as S&P, FTSE, DAX, CAC40 and other G12 country indices. Indices for OTC products are broadly similar, but offer more flexibility..  

# Equity basket derivatives  

Equity basket [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) are [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), options or swaps where the underlying is a non-index basket of shares. They have similar characteristics to equity index [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), but are always traded OTC (over the counter, ie between. established [institutional investors](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%204%20Institutional%20Trading.md)), as the basket definition is not standardized in the way that an equity index is..  

These are used normally for correlation trading.  

# Single-stock futures  

Single-stock [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) are exchange-traded [futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) based on an individual underlying security rather than a.   
[stock index](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md). Their performance is similar to that of the underlying equity itself, although as [futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) they are.   
usually traded with greater [leverage](../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md). Another difference is that holders of long positions in single stock [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md).   
typically do not receive dividends and holders of short positions do not pay dividends. Single-stock [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) may be.   
cash-settled or physically settled by the transfer of the underlying stocks at expiration, although in the United States only [physical settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Futures%20and%20Forwards.md) is used to avoid speculation in the market....  

# Equity index swaps  

An equity index swap is an agreement between two parties to swap two sets of cash flows on predetermined dates for. an agreed number of years. The cash flows will be an equity index value swapped, for instance, with LIBOR. Swaps. can be considered as being a relatively straightforward way of gaining exposure to an asset class you require. They can also be relatively cost efficient.  

# Equity swap  

An [equity swap](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%204%20-%20Swap%20Markets/Equity%20Commodity%20and%20Exotic%20Swaps.md), like an equity index swap, is an agreement between two parties to swap two sets of cash flows. In this case the cash flows will be the price of an underlying stock value swapped, for instance, with LIBOR. A typical example of this type of derivative is the Contract for difference (CFD) where one party gains exposure to a share price without buying or selling the underlying share making it relatively cost efficient as well as making it relevantly easy to transact.  

# Exchange-traded derivatives  

Other examples of equity [derivative securities](Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) include exchange-traded funds and Intellidexes.

In finance, a warrant is a security that entitles the holder to buy the underlying stock of the issuing company at a fixed [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md) until the expiry date.  

Warrants and options are similar in that the two contractual [financial instruments](../Financial%20Instruments/A%20Practical%20Guide%20for%20Actuaries%20and%20other%20Business%20Professionals..md) allow the holder special rights to buy securities. Both are discretionary and have expiration dates. The word warrant simply means to "endow with the right", which is only slightly different to the meaning of an option.  

Warrants are frequently attached to bonds or preferred stock as a sweetener, allowing the issuer to pay lower [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) or dividends. They can be used to enhance the yield of the bond, and make them more attractive to potential buyers. Warrants can also be used in [private equity](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2014%20-%20Private%20Equity,%20Pension,%20and%20Sovereign%20Funds/Private%20Equity.md) deals. Frequently, these warrants are detachable, and can be sold independently of the bond or stock.  

In the case of warrants issued with preferred stocks, stockholders may need to detach and sell the warrant before they can receive [dividend payments](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md). Thus, it is sometimes beneficial to detach and sell a warrant as soon as possible so the investor can earn dividends.  

Warrants are actively traded in some [financial markets](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) such as Deutsche Borse and Hong Kong. In Hong Kong Stock Exchange, warrants accounted for. $11.7\%$ of the turnover in the first quarter of 2009, just second to the callable bull/bear contract. 2]  

# Structure and features  

Warrants have similar characteristics to that of other equity [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), such as options, for instance:  

. Exercising: A warrant is exercised when the holder informs the issuer their intention to purchase the shares underlying the warrant.  

The warrant parameters, such as [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md), are fixed shortly after the issue of the bond. With warrants, it is important to consider the following main characteristics:  

. Premium: A warrant's "premium" represents how much extra you have to pay for your shares when buying them through the warrant as compared to buying them in the regular way.   
.Gearing ([leverage](../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md)): A warrant's "gearing" is the way to ascertain how much more exposure you have to the underlying shares using the warrant as compared to the exposure you would have if you buy shares through the market.   
:[Expiration Date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md): This is the date the warrant expires. If you plan on exercising the warrant you must do so before the [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). The more time remaining until expiry, the more time for the underlying security to appreciate, which, in turn, will increase the price of the warrant (unless it depreciates). Therefore, the expiry date is the date on which the right to exercise no longer exists.   
Restrictions on exercise: Like options, there are different exercise types associated with warrants such as American style (holder can exercise anytime before expiration) or European style (holder can only exercise on [expiration date](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md)).[3]  

Warrants are longer-dated options and are generally traded over-the-counter.  

# Secondary market  

Sometimes the issuer will try to establish a market for the warrant and to register it with a listed exchange. In this case, the price can be obtained from a broker. But often, warrants are privately held or not registered, which makes their prices less obvious. Warrants can be easily tracked by adding a "w" after the company's ticker symbol to check the warrant's price. Unregistered warrant transactions can still be facilitated between accredited parties, and in fact several secondary markets have been formed to provide [liquidity](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) for these investments.  

# Comparison with call options  

Warrants are very similar to call options. For instance, many warrants confer the same rights as equity options, and warrants often can be traded in secondary markets like options. However, there also are several key differences between warrants and equity options:  

.Warrants are issued by private parties, typically the corporation on which a warrant is based, rather than a public. options exchange.   
Warrants issued by the company itself are dilutive. When the warrant issued by the company is exercised, the. company issues new shares of stock, so the number of outstanding shares increases. When a call option is. exercised, the owner of the call option receives an existing share from an assigned call writer (except in the case of employee stock options, where new shares are created and issued by the company upon exercise). Unlike common stock shares outstanding, warrants do not have voting rights.   
Warrants are considered over the counter instruments, and thus are usually only traded by [financial institutions](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md). with the capacity to settle and clear these types of transactions.   
A warrant's lifetime is measured in years (as long as 15 years), while options are typically measured in months. Even LEAPS (long-term equity anticipation securities), the longest stock options available, tend to expire in two or three years. Upon expiration, the warrants are worthless unless the price of the common stock is greater than. the [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md).  

Warrants are not standardized like exchange-listed options. While investors can write stock options on the ASX (or CBOE), they are not permitted to do so with ASX-listed warrants, since only companies can issue warrants,. and while each option contract is over 1000 underlying ordinary shares (100 on CBOE), the number of warrants that must be exercised by the holder to buy the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) depends on the conversion ratio set out in the. offer documentation for the warrant issue.  

# Types of warrants  

A wide range of warrants and warrant types are available. The reasons you might invest in one type of warrant may be different from the reasons you might invest in another type of warrant..  

.Equity warrants: Equity warrants can be [call and put](../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/Notes%20on%20Basic%20Options%20Properties.md) warrants. .Callable warrants: give you the right to buy the [underlying securities](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Rate%20and%20Price%20Trees.md) :Putable warrants: give you the right to sell the [underlying securities](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Rate%20and%20Price%20Trees.md).   
.Covered warrants: A covered warrants is a warrant that has some underlying backing, for example the issuer will purchase the stock beforehand or will use other instruments to cover the option.. Basket warrants: As with a regular equity index, warrants can be classified at, for example, an industry level. Thus, it mirrors the performance of the industry.   
Index warrants: Index warrants use an index as the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). Your risk is dispersed-using index call and index put warrants-just like with regular equity indexes. It should be noted that they are priced using index points. That is, you deal with cash, not directly with shares. Wedding warrants: are attached to the host debentures and can be exercised only if the host debentures are surrendered   
Detachable warrants: the warrant portion of the security can be detached from the debenture and traded separately.   
.Naked warrants: are issued without an accompanying bond, and like traditional warrants, are traded on the stock. exchange.  

# Traditional  

Traditional warrants are issued in conjunction with a Bond (known as a warrant-linked bond), and represent the right to acquire shares in the entity issuing the bond. In other words, the writer of a traditional warrant is also the issuer of the underlying instrument. Warrants are issued in this way as a "sweetener" to make the bond issue more attractive, and to reduce the interest rate that must be offered in order to sell the bond issue.  

# Example  

.Price paid for bond with warrants $P_{0}$ [Coupon payments](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) C   
Maturity T Required rate of return r Face value of bond $\mathbf{F}$ ${\mathrm{Value~of~warrants}}=P_{0}-\left(\sum_{t=1}^{T}{\frac{C}{(1+r)^{t}}}\right)-{\frac{F}{(1+r)^{T}}}.$  

# Naked  

Naked warrants are issued without an accompanying bond, and like traditional warrants, are traded on the stock exchange. They are typically issued by banks and securities firms. These are also called covered warrants, and are settled for cash, e.g. do not involve the company who issues the shares that underlie the warrant. In most markets around the world, covered warrants are more popular than the traditional warrants described above. Financially they are also similar to call options, but are typically bought by retail investors, rather than [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) funds or banks, who prefer the more keenly priced options which tend to trade on a different market. Covered warrants normally trade alongside equities, which makes them easier for retail investors to buy and sell them.  

# Third-party warrants  

Third-party warrant is a derivative issued by the holders of the underlying instrument. Suppose a company issues warrants which give the holder the right to convert each warrant into one share at. $\$500$ . This warrant is. company-issued. Suppose, a mutual fund that holds shares of the company sells warrants against those shares, also exercisable at $\$500$ per share. These are called third-party warrants. The primary advantage is that the instrument. helps in the price discovery process. In the above case, the mutual fund selling a one-year warrant exercisable at $\$500$ sends a signal to other investors that the stock may trade at $\$500$ -levels in one year. If volumes in such. warrants are high, the price discovery process will be that much better; for it would mean that many investors believe that the stock will trade at that level in one year. Third-party warrants are essentially long-term call options. The. seller of the warrants does a [covered call](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2018%20-%20Stock%20Options%20and%20Stock%20Index%20Options.md)-write. That is, the seller will hold the stock and sell warrants against them. If the stock does not cross. $\$500$ , the buyer will not exercise the warrant. The seller will, therefore, keep the warrant. premium.

# Pricing  

There are various methods (models) of evaluation available to value warrants theoretically, including the [Black-Scholes](Mathematical%20Modeling%20of%20Derivative%20Pricing.md) evaluation model. However, it is important to have some understanding of the various influences on warrant prices. The market value of a warrant can be divided into two components:  

Intrinsic value: This is simply the difference between the exercise (strike) price and the underlying [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md). Warrants are also referred to as in-the-money or out-of-the-money, depending on where the current [asset price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) is in relation to the warrant's [exercise price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Options.md). Thus, for instance, for call warrants, if the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) is below the [strike price](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md), the warrant has no intrinsic value (only time value--to be explained shortly). If the [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) is above the strike, the warrant has intrinsic value and is said to be in-the-money. :Time value: Time value can be considered as the value of the continuing exposure to the movement in the underlying security that the warrant provides. Time value declines as the expiry of the warrant gets closer. This erosion of time value is called time decay. It is not constant, but increases rapidly towards expiry. A warrant's  

time value is affected by the following factors:  

Time to expiry: The longer the time to expiry, the greater the time value of the warrant. This is because the price of the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) has a greater probability of moving in-the-money which makes the warrant more valuable.   
.Volatility: The more volatile the underlying instrument, the higher the price of the warrant will be (as the warrant is more likely to end up in-the-money)..   
.Dividends: To include the factor of receiving dividends depends on if the holder of the warrant is permitted to receive dividends from the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md).   
.[Interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md): An increase in [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) will lead to more expensive call warrants and cheaper put warrants. The level of [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) reflects the [opportunity cost of capital](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Market%20Players%20Hedgers%20Vs%20Speculators.md).  

# Uses  

. [Portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) protection: Put warrants allow the owner to protect the value of the owner's [portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) against falls in the market or in particular shares.

# Risks  

There are certain risks involved in trading warrants-including time decay. Time decay: "Time value" diminishes as time goes by-the rate of decay increases the closer to the date of expiration.  

# Uses of the term warrant other than as an option on equities  

# Warrant as a check or IOU issued by a government agency  

The term warrant is sometimes used in the US to mean a warrant of payment which is a check or an IOU issued by a governmental agency. California differentiates between normal warrants, which can be exchanged immediately for cash and registered warrants which are 1OUs.4]  

In the late 1990s, when the State of California had a budget crisis due to a disagreement between the governor and the legislature, the state treasurer was forced to issue warrants paying $18\%$ interest in lieu of being able to pay the state's bills with real money. The state had not issued warrants since before the Depression of the 1930s. Many institutions accepted them at face value because of the interest provision. Interestingly, the comptroller of Los Angeles County was buying the warrants because the county had surplus funds to take advantage of the higher [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) on the warrants.  

In some states, a warrant is a demand draft drawn on a government's treasury to pay its bills. Checks or electronic payments have replaced these warrants, but in Arkansas, some counties and school districts uses warrants for non-electronic payments

# Foreign exchange option  

In finance, a foreign exchange option (commonly shortened to just FX option or [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) option) is a derivative financial instrument where the owner has the right but not the obligation to exchange money denominated in one [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) into another curency at a pre-agreed exchange rate on a specified date. 1]  

The FX options market is the deepest, largest and most liquid market for options of any kind in the world. Most of the FX option volume is traded OTC and is lightly regulated, but a fraction is traded on exchanges like the International Securities Exchange, Philadelphia Stock Exchange, or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for options on [futures contracts](Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md). The global market for exchange-traded [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) options was notionally valued by the Bank for International Settlements at $\$158,300$ billion in 2005.  

# Example  

For example a GBPUSD FX option might be specified by a contract giving the owner the right but not the obligation to sell 1,000,000 and buy $\$2,000,000$ on December 31. In this case the pre-agreed exchange rate, or strike price, is. 2.0000 USD per GBP (or 0.5000 GBP per USD) and the notionals are 1,000,000 and $\$2,000,000$  

This type of contract is both a call on dollars and a put on sterling, and is often called a GBPUSD put by market participants, as it is a put on the exchange rate; it could equally be called a USDGBP call, but market convention is quote GBPUSD (USD per GBP).  

If the rate is lower than 2.0000 come December 31 (say at 1.9000), meaning that the dollar is stronger and the pound is weaker, then the option will be exercised, allowing the owner to sell GBP at 2.o000 and immediately buy it back in the spot market at 1.9000, making a profit of (2.0000 GBPUSD - 1.9000 GBPUSD) $\boldsymbol{*}1,000,000~\mathrm{GBP}=100,000$ USD in the process. If they immediately exchange their profit into GBP this amounts to $100,000/1.9000=52,631.58$ GBP.  

# Terms  

Generally in thinking about options, one assumes that one is buying an asset: for instance, you can have a call option on oil, which allows you to buy oil at a given price. One can consider this situation more symmetrically in FX, where one exchanges: a put on GBPUSD allows one to exchange GBP for USD: it is at once a put on GBP and a call on. USD.  

As a vivid example: people usually consider that in a fast food restaurant, one buys hamburgers and pays in dollars, but one can instead say that the restaurant buys dollars and pays in hamburgers.  

There are a number of subtleties that follow from this symmetry.  

Ratio of notionals  

The ratio of the notionals in an FX option is the strike, not the current spot or forward. Notably, when constructing an option strategy from FX options, one must be careful to match the foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) notionals,. not the local [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) notionals, else the foreign currencies received and delivered don't offset and one is left. with [residual risk](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Residual%20Risk%20of%20Options%20Gamma%20Vega%20and%20Volatil.md).  

Non-linear payoff  

The payoff for a vanilla option is linear in the underlying, when one denominates the payout in a given numeraire. In the case of an FX option on a rate, one must be careful of which [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) is the underlying and which is the numeraire: in the above example, an option on GBPUSD gives a USD value that is linear in GBPUSD (a move from 2.0000 to 1.9000 yields a . $10*\mathbb{S}2,000,000/2.0000=\mathbb{S}100,000$ profit), but has a non-linear GBP value. Conversely, the GBP value is linear in the USDGBP rate, while the USD value is non-linear. This is because inverting a rate has the effect of. $x\mapsto1/x$ , which is non-linear.  

Change of numeraire  

The [implied volatility](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/A%20Real-Life%20Option%20Pricing%20Exercise.md) of an FX option depends on the numeraire of the purchaser, again because of the non-linearity of $x\mapsto1/x$  

# Hedging with FX options  

Corporations primarily use FX options to hedge uncertain [future cash flows](Advanced%20Derivatives%20Pricing%20Methodology.md) in a foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). The general rule is to hedge certain foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) cash flows with [forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md), and uncertain foreign cash flows with options.  

Suppose a United Kingdom manufacturing firm is expecting to be paid. $\mathrm{US}\$100,000$ for a piece of engineering equipment to be delivered in 90 days. If the GBP strengthens against the ${\mathrm{US}}\Phi$ over the next 90 days the UK firm will lose money, as it will receive less GBP when the $\mathrm{US}\mathbb{S}100{,}000$ is converted into GBP. However, if the GBP weaken against the ${\mathrm{US}}\Phi$ , then the UK firm will gain additional money: the firm is exposed to FX risk. Assuming that the cash flow is certain, the firm can enter into a forward contract to deliver the. $\mathrm{US}\$100,000$ in 90 days time, in exchange for GBP at the current [forward rate](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md). This [forward contract](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) is free, and, presuming the expected cash arrives, exactly matches the firm's exposure, perfectly [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) their FX risk..  

If the [cash flow](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) is uncertain, the firm will likely want to use options: if the firm enters a forward FX contract and the expected USD cash is not received, then the forward, instead of [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md), exposes the firm to FX risk in the opposite. direction.  

Using options, the UK firm can purchase a GBP call/USD put option (the right to sell part or all of their expected income for pounds sterling at a predetermined rate), which will:  

protect the GBP value that the firm will receive in 90 day's time (presuming the cash is received) cost at most the option premium (unlike a forward, which can have unlimited losses) yield a profit if the expected cash is not received but FX rates move in its favor  

# Valuing FX options: The Garman-Kohlhagen model  

As in the [Black-Scholes model](../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md) for stock options and the [Black model](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Black%20Models%20for%20Bond%20Price%20Options%20Capsfloors.md) for certain interest rate options, the value of a European option on an FX rate is typically calculated by assuming that the rate follows a log-normal process.  

In 1983 Garman and Kohlhagen extended the [Black-Scholes model](../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md) to cope with the presence of two [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) (one for each [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)). Suppose that $\boldsymbol{r}_{d}$ is the [risk-free interest rate](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) to expiry of the domestic [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) and $r_{f}$ is the foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) [risk-free interest rate](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) (where domestic [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) is the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) in which we obtain the value of the option; the formula also requires that FX rates - both strike and current spot be quoted in terms of "units of domestic [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) per unit of foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)").  

Then the domestic [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) value of a call option into the foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) is

# Risk Management  

Garman-Kohlhagen (GK) is the standard model used to calculate the price of an FX option, however there are a wide range of techniques in use for calculating the options risk exposure, or [Greeks](Derivatives/Part%20V%20-%20Options%20Pricing/Chapter%2026%20-%20Pricing%20Options:%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation.md) (as for example the Vanna-Volga method). Although the price produced by every model will agree, the risk numbers calculated by different models can vary significantly depending on the assumptions used for the properties of the spot price movements, [volatility surface](7.%20Black%20Scholes%20Model.md) and [interest rate curves](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/__temp__Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates.md).  

After GK, the most common models in use are SABR and local volatility, although when agreeing risk numbers with a counterparty (e.g. for exchanging delta, or calculating the strike on a 25 delta option) the Garman-Kohlhagen numbers are always used.

# Gold as an investment  

Of all the precious metals, gold is the most popular as an [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).11] Investors generally buy gold as a hedge or safe haven against any economic, political, social, or fiat [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) crises (including [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) market declines, burgeoning national debt, [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) failure, [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918â€“1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), war and social unrest). The gold market is also subject to. speculation as other [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) are, especially through the use of.

# Gold price  

Gold has been used throughout history as money and has been a. relative standard for [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) equivalents specific to economic regions. or countries. Many European countries implemented gold standards in the later part of the 19th century until these were dismantled in the financial crises involving World War I. After World War II, the

A Good Delivery bar, the standard for trade in the major international gold markets.  

Bretton Woods system pegged the United States dollar to gold at a rate of $\mathrm{USS}35$ per troy ounce. The system existed until the 1971 Nixon Shock, when the US unilaterally suspended the direct convertibility of the United States dollar to gold and made the transition to a fiat [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) system. The last [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) to be divorced from gold was the Swiss Franc in 2000.  

Since 1919 the most common benchmark for the price of gold has been the London gold fixing, a twice-daily telephone meeting of representatives from five bullion-trading firms of the London bullion market. Furthermore, gold is traded continuously throughout the world based on the intra-day spot price, derived from over-the-counter gold-trading markets around the world (code "XAU"). The following table sets forth the gold price versus various assets and key statistics:

In March 2008, the gold price exceeded US\$1,000,[9] achieving a nominal high of $\mathrm{US}\$1,004.38$ In real terms, actual value was still well below the US\$599 peak in 1981 (equivalent to $\$1417$ in U.S. 2008 dollar value). After the March. 2008 spike, gold prices declined to a low of. $\mathrm{US}\$71230$ per ounce in November. Pricing soon resumed on upward momentum by temporarily breaking the. $\mathrm{US}\$1000$ barrier again in late February 2009 but regressed moderately later in the quarter.  

Later in 2009, the March 2008 intra-day spot price record of US\$1,033.90 was broken several times in October, as the price of gold entered parabolic stages of successively new highs when a spike reversal to. $\$1234$ initiated a retrace of the price to the mid-October levels.  

On November 9, 2010, gold closed at a new nominal high of \$1421.00 in NYMEx.10]  

# Factors influencing the gold price  

Today, like most [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), the price of gold is driven by supply and demand as well as speculation. However.   
unlike most other [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), saving and disposal plays a larger role in affecting its price than its consumption.   
Most of the gold ever mined still exists in accessible form, such as bullion and mass-produced jewelry, with little.   
value over its fine weight -- and is thus potentilly able to come back onto the gold market for the right price.11 12] At the end of 2006, it was estimated that all the gold ever mined totalled 158000 tonnes ( LT; ST).[13] This can be.   
represented by a cube with an edge length of 20.2 metres (66 ft).  

Given the huge quantity of gold stored above-ground compared to the annual production, the price of gold is mainly affected by changes in sentiment, rather than changes in annual production.[14] According to the World Gold Council, annual mine production of gold over the last few years has been close to 2,500 tonnes.15] About 2,000 tonnes goes into jewellery or industrial/dental production, and around 500 tonnes goes to retail investors and  

exchange traded gold funds.115]  

# Central banks  

Central banks and the International Monetary Fund play an important role in the gold price. At the end of 2004 central banks and official organizations held 19 percent of all above-ground gold as official gold reserves.[16] The ten. year Washington Agreement on Gold (WAG), which dates from September 1999, limits gold sales by its members. (Europe, United States, Japan, Australia, Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund) to less than 500 tonnes a year.117] European central banks, such as the [Bank of England](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock.md) and Swiss National Bank, were. key sellers of gold over this period.!18] In 2009, this agreement was extended for a further five years, but with a. smaller annual sales limit of 400 tonnes.[19]  

Although central banks do not generally announce gold purchases in advance, some, such as Russia, have expressed. interest in growing their gold reserves again as of late 2005.[20] In early 2006, China, which only holds. $1.3\%$ of its reserves in gold,[21] announced that it was looking for ways to improve the [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on its official reserves. Some. bulls hope that this signals that China might reposition more of its holdings into gold in line with other Central Banks. India has recently purchased over 200 tons of gold which has led to a surge in prices.[22]  

# Hedge against financial stress  

Gold, like all precious metals, may be used as a hedge against [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918â€“1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), deflation or [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) devaluation. As Joe Foster, [portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) manager of the New York-based Van Eck International Gold Fund, explained in September 2010:  

The currencies of all the major countries, including ours, are under severe pressure because of massive government deficits. The more money that is pumped into these economies - the printing of money basically - then the less valuable the currencies become.[23]  

If the return on bonds, equities and real estate is not adequately compensating for risk and [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918â€“1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) then the demand. for gold and other [alternative investments](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2014%20-%20Private%20Equity,%20Pension,%20and%20Sovereign%20Funds/Risk%20Allocation%20for%20Pension%20Funds%20and%20Sovereig.md) such as [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) increases. An example of this is the period of stagflation that occurred during the 1970s and which led to an economic bubble forming in precious metals.24] [25]  

# Jewelery and industrial demand  

Jewelery consistently accounts for over two-thirds of annual gold demand. India is the largest consumer in volume terms, accounting for 27% of demand in 2009, followed by China and the USA.[26]  

Industrial, dentistry and medical uses account for around. $12\%$ of gold demand. Gold has high thermal and electrical. conductivity properties, along with a high resistance to corrosion and bacterial colonization. Jewelery and industrial demand has fluctuated over the past few years due to the steady expansion in emerging markets of middle classes aspiring to Western lifestyles, offset by the financial crisi of 2007-2010.[27]  

# Short selling  

The price of gold is also affected by various well-documented mechanisms of artificial price suppression, arising from fractional-reserve [banking](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) and naked short selling in gold, and particularly involving the London Bullion Market Association, the United States [Federal Reserve System](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Fed%20Fund%20Futures.md), and the banks HSBC and [JPMorgan Chase](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Case%20Study%20of%20JP%20Morgan.md).[28] [29] [30] [31] Gold market observers have noted for many years that he price of gold tends to fll atificialy at the start of New York rading [32]  

# War, invasion and national emergency  

When dollars were fully convertible into gold via the gold standard, both were regarded as money. However, most people preferred to carry around paper banknotes rather than the somewhat heavier and less divisible gold coins. If people feared their bank would fail, a [bank run](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) might result. This happened in the USA during the [Great Depression](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%201928-1937.md). of the 1930s, leading President Roosevelt to impose a national emergency and issue Executive Order 6102 outlawing the ownership of gold by US citizens.33] There was only one prosecution under the order, and in that case the order was ruled invalid by federal judge John M. Woolsey, on the technical grounds that the order was signed by the President, not the Secretary of the Treasury as required.34]  

In times of war, people fear that their assets may be seized and that the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) may become worthless. They see gold as a solid asset which will always buy food or transportation. Thus in times of great uncertainty, particularly when war is feared, the demand for gold rises 35] [36]  

# Investment vehicles  

# Bars  

The most traditional way of investing in gold is by buying bullion gold bars. In some countries, like Canada Argentina, Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, these can easily be bought or sold at the major banks. Alternatively, there are bullion dealers that provide the same service. Bars are available in various sizes. For example in Europe, Good Delivery bars are approximately 400 troy ounces $(12\mathrm{kg})$ [37] 1 kilogram (32 ozt) are also popular, although many other weights exist, such as the 10oz, 1oz, $10\mathrm{g}$ , 100 g, 1 kg, 1 Tael, and 1 Tola..  

Bars generally carry lower price premiums than gold bullion coins.   
However larger bars carry an increased risk of forgery due to their less.  

![](8e00d94671e6fb37bcfcae39af84b319020f3f7d735d3d887be4586418eb19f2.jpg)  
1 troy ounce (31 g) gold bar with certificate  

stringent parameters for appearance. While bullion coins can be easily weighed and measured against known values, most bars cannot, and gold buyers often have bars re-assayed. Larger bars also have a greater volume in which to create a partial forgery using a tungsten-filed cavity, which may not be revealed by anasay 1380  

Efforts to combat gold bar counterfeiting include kinebars which employ a unique holographic technology and are manufactured by the Argor-Heraeus refinery in Switzerland..  

# Coins  

Gold coins are a common way of owning gold. Bullion coins are priced. according to their fine weight, plus a small premium based on supply. and demand (as opposed to numismatic gold coins which are priced mainly by supply and demand based on rarity and condition)..  

The Krugerrand is the most widely-held gold bullion coin, with 46000000 troy ounces (1400 tonnes) in circulation. Other common gold bullion coins include the Australian Gold Nugget (Kangaroo), Austrian Philharmoniker (Philharmonic), Austrian 100 Corona, Canadian Gold Maple Leaf, Chinese Gold Panda, Malaysian Kijang

The faces of a Krugerrand, the most common gold bullion coin.  

Emas, French Coq d'Or (Golden Rooster), Mexican Gold 50 Peso, British Sovereign, and American Gold Eagle. Coins may be purchased from a variety of dealers both large and small. Fake gold coins are not uncommon, and are usually made of gold-plated lead.  

# Exchange-traded products (ETPs)  

Gold exchange-traded products may include ETFs, ETNs, and CEFs which are traded like shares on the major [stock exchanges](An%20Introduction%20to%20Equity%20Markets.md). The first gold ETF, Gold Bullion Securities (ticker symbol "GOLD"), was launched in March 2003 on the Australian Stock Exchange, and originally represented exactly 0.1 troy ounces $_{(3.1\textrm{g})}$ of gold. As of November 2010, SPDR Gold Shares is the second-largest exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the world by [market capitalization](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Price-to-Sales%20Ratios%20in%20Stock%20Valuation.md).39]  

Gold ETPs represent an easy way to gain exposure to the gold price, without the inconvenience of storing physical bars. However exchange-traded gold instruments, even those which hold physical gold for the benefit of the investor, carry risks beyond those inherent in the precious metal itself. For example the most popular gold ETP (GLD) has been widely criticized, and even compared with [mortgage-backed securities](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Fremont%20Financial%20Corp.%20(b).md), due to features of its complex Structure.[28 [40] [41] [42 [43]  

Typically a small commission is charged for trading in gold ETPs and a small annual storage fee is charged. The annual expenses of the fund such as storage, insurance, and management fees are charged by selling a small amount of gold represented by each certificate, so the amount of gold in each certificate will gradually decline over time.  

Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) companies that are legally classified as open-end companies or Unit [Investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) Trusts (UITs), but that differ from traditional open-end companies and UITs.44] The main differences are that ETFs do not sell directly to investors and they issue their shares in what are called "Creation Units" (large blocks such as blocks of 50,o00 shares). Also, the Creation Units may not be purchased with cash but a basket of securities that mirrors the ETF's [portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). Usually, the Creation Units are split up and re-sold on a [secondary market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md).  

ETF shares can be sold in basically two ways. The investors can sell the individual shares to other investors, or they can sell the Creation Units back to the ETF. In addition, ETFs generally redeem Creation Units by giving investors the securities that comprise the [portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) instead of cash. Because of the limited redeemability of ETF shares, ETFs are not considered to be and may not call themselves mutual funds.44]  

# Certificates  

Gold certificates allow gold investors to avoid the risks and costs associated with the transfer and storage of physical. bullion (such as theft, large bid-offer spread, and metallurgical assay costs) by taking on a different set of risks and costs associated with the certificate itself (such as commissions, storage fees, and various types of [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md))..  

Banks may issue gold certificates for gold which is allocated (non-fungible) or unallocated (fungible or pooled). Unallocated gold certificates are a form of fractional reserve [banking](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) and do not guarantee an equal exchange for metal in the event of a run on the issuing bank's gold on deposit.45 Allocated gold certificates should be correlated with specific numbered bars, although it is difficult to determine whether a bank is improperly allocating a single bar to more than one party [46]  

The first paper bank notes were gold certificates. They were first issued in the 17th century when they were used by goldsmiths in England and The Netherlands for customers who kept deposits of gold bullion in their vault for safe-keeping. Two centuries later, the gold certificates began being issued in the United States when the US Treasury issued such certificates that could be exchanged for gold. The United States Government first authorized the use of the gold certificates in 1863. In the early 1930s the US Government restricted the private gold ownership in the United States and therefore, the gold certificates stopped circulating as money. Nowadays, gold certificates are still issued by gold pool programs in Australia and the United States, as well as by banks in Germany and Switzerland.  

# Accounts  

Many types of gold "accounts" are available. Different accounts impose varying types of intermediation between the.   
client and their gold. One of the most important differences between accounts is whether the gold is held on an.   
allocated (non-fungible) or unallocated (fungible) basis. Another major difference is the strength of the account.   
holder's claim on the gold, in the event that the account administrator faces gold-denominated liabilities (due to a short or naked short position in gold for example), asset forfeiture, or bankruptcy.. Many banks offer gold accounts where gold can be instantly bought or sold just like any foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) on a.   
fractional reserve (non-allocated, fungible) basis. Swiss banks offer similar service on an allocated (non-fungible).

Along with chronic delivery delays, some investors have received delivery of bars not matching their contract in serial number and weight. The delays cannot be easily explained by slow warehouse movements, as the daily reports of these movements show little activity. Because of these problems, there are concerns that COMEX may not have the gold inventory to back its existing warehouse rceipts. 48]  

Firms such as Cantor Index, CMC Markets, IG Index and City Index, all from the UK, provide contract for difference (CFD) or spread bets on the price of gold.  

# Mining companies  

These do not represent gold at all, but rather are shares in gold mining companies. If the gold price rises, the profits of the gold mining company could be expected to rise and as a result the share price may rise. However, there are many factors to take into account and it is not always the case that a share price will rise when the gold price increases. Mines are commercial enterprises and subject to problems such as flooding, subsidence and structural failure, as well as mismanagement, theft and corruption. Such factors can lower the share prices of mining companies.  

The price of gold bullion is volatile, but unhedged gold shares and funds are regarded as even higher risk and even more volatile. This additional volatility is due to the inherent [leverage](../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) in the mining sector. For example, if you own a share in a gold mine where the costs of production are $\$300$ per ounce and the price of gold is $\$600$ , the mine's [profit margin](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Operating%20Margin.md) will be. $\$300$ A $10\%$ increase in the gold price to $\$660$ per ounce will push that margin up to $\$360$ which represents a. $20\%$ increase in the mine's profitability, and potentially a $20\%$ increase in the share price. Furthermore, at higher prices, more ounces of gold become economically viable to mines, enabling companies to add to their reserves. Conversely, share movements also amplify falls in the gold price. For example, a. $10\%$ fall in the gold price to $\$540$ will decrease that margin to $\$240$ , which represents a. $20\%$ fall in the mine's profitability, and potentially a $20\%$ decrease in the share price.  

To reduce this volatility, some gold mining companies hedge the gold price up to 18 months in advance. This provides the mining company and investors with less exposure to short term gold price fluctuations, but reduces [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) when the gold price is rising.  

# Investment strategies  

# Fundamental analysis  

Investors using [fundamental analysis](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%201/Week%201%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20Analysis.md) analyze the macroeconomic situation, which includes international economic indicators, such as GDP growth rates, [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918â€“1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md), productivity and energy prices. They would also analyze the yearly global gold supply versus demand. Over 2005 the World Gold Council estimated yearly global gold supply to be 3,859 tonnes and demand to be 3,754 tonnes, giving a surplus of 105 tonnes.49] while gold production is unlikely to change in the near future, supply and demand due to private ownership is highly liquid and subject to rapid changes. This makes gold very different from almost every other commodity.[11] [12] Identifiable [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) demand for gold, which includes gold exchange-traded funds, bars and coins, was up 64 percent in 2008 over the year before.[50]  

# Gold versus stocks  

In the last century, major economic crises (such as the [Great Depression](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%201928-1937.md), World War II, the first and second oil crisis) lowered the Dow/gold ratio, an indicator of how bad a recession is and whether the outlook is deteriorating or improving, to a value well below 4. The ratio fell on February 18, 2009 to below 8.[50] During these difficult times, many investors tried to preserve their assets by investing in precious metals, most notably gold and silver.  

The performance of gold bullion is often compared to stocks due to their fundamental differences. Gold is regarded by some as a. store of value (without growth) whereas  

![](f8d789c80145779cfbbf4821ed0f21b49816b483d8818f9637d6074a16ff8aa7.jpg)  

stocks are regarded as a return on value (i.e., growth from anticipated real price increase plus dividends). Stocks and bonds perform best in a stable political climate with strong property rights and little turmoil. The attached graph. shows the value of Dow Jones Industrial Average divided by the price of an ounce of gold. Since 1800, stocks have consistently gained value in comparison to gold in part because of the stability of the American political system.[51] This appreciation has been cyclical with long periods of stock outperformance followed by long periods of gold. outperformance. The Dow Industrials bottomed out a ratio of 1:1 with gold during 1980 (the end of the 1970s bear market) and proceeded to post gains throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The gold price peak of 1980 also coincided. with the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan and the threat of the global expansion of communism. The ratio. peaked on January 14, 2000 a value of 41.3 and has fallen sharply since.  

On November 30, 2005, Rick Munarriz of The Motley Fool posed the question of which represented a better [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md): a share of Google or an ounce of gold. The specific comparison between these two very different investments seems to have captured the imagination of many in the [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) community and is serving to crystallize the broader debate.!52] [53] At the time of writing, a share of Googles stock was $\$405$ and an ounce of gold was one day from breaking the. $\$500$ barrier, which it did December 1. On January 4, 2008 23:58 New York Time, it was reported that an ounce of gold outpaced the share price of Google by $30.77\%$ , with gold closing at $\$859.19$ per ounce and a share of Google closing at $\$657$ on U.S. market exchanges. On January 24, 2008, the gold price broke the $\$900$ mark per ounce for the first time. The price of gold topped $\$1,000$ an ounce for the first time ever on March  

13, 2008 amid recession fears i the United States.54] Google closed 2008 at $\$307.65$ While gold closed the year at $\$866$ Leading into 2010, Google had doubled off that $100\%$ , whereas gold had risen $40\%$  

Note that the analysis of log-linear oscillations in the gold [price dynamics](Derivatives/Part%20XII%20-%20Price%20Dynamics/Chapter%2047%20-%20Asset%20Price%20Dynamics.md) for 2003-2010 conducted recently by Askar Akayev's research group has alowed them to forecast a collapse in gold prie in April - June 2011.155]  

# Technical analysis  

As with stocks, gold investors may base their [investment decision](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%201%20Introduction%20to%20Securities%20Trading%20and%20Markets.md) partly on, or solely on, technical analysis. Typically, this involves analyzing chart patterns, moving averages, market trends and/or the [economic cycle](../International%20Finance/Economic%20Stabilization%20Notes/Business%20Cycles-%20Introduction,%20Characteristics,%20and%20History.md) in order to speculate on the future price.  

# Using leverage  

Bullish investors may choose to [leverage](../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) their position by borrowing money against their existing assets and then. purchasing gold on account with the loaned funds. [Leverage](../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) is also an integral part of buying gold [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) and unhedged gold mining company shares (see gold mining companies). [Leverage](../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) or [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) may increase. [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) gains but also increases the corresponding risk of capital loss if/when the trend reverses..  

# Taxation  

Gold maintains a special position in the market with many tax regimes. For example, in the European Union the trading of recognised gold coins and bullion products are free of VAT. Silver, and other precious metals or [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), do not have the same allowance. Other taxes such as capital gains tax may also apply for individuals depending on their tax residency. U.S. citizens may be taxed on their gold profits at 15, 23, 28 or 35 percent, depending on the [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) vehicle used.(56]  

USA: Due to section 9006 of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, starting on January 1, 2012, IRS tax form 1099 will be required for all purchases of goods and services that exceed $\$600$ per calendar year. This new reporting requirement will cover precious metals. With gold at $\$1200$ per ounce, this would make it impossible to sell a typical one-ounce bullion coin without IRS paperwork. As of July 2010 the bullion industry is fighting the regulation, and California Representative Dan Lungren has introduced legislation to have the relevant section of [the Act](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/The%20Dodd%20Frank%20Act%20and%20Its%20Impact.md) reversed.[57]  

# Scams and frauds  

Gold attracts its fair share of fraudulent activity. Some of the most common to be aware of are:  

.High-yield [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) programs - HYIPs are usually just pyramid schemes dressed up with no real value underneath. Using gold in their prospectus makes them seem more solid and trustworthy.   
: Advance fee fraud - Various emails circulate on the Internet for buyers or sellers of up to 10,o00 metric tonnes of gold. This is more gold than the US Federal Reserve owns. Often naive middlemen are drafted in as hopeful brokers, and usually mention mythical terms like 'Swiss Procedure' or 'FCO' (Full Corporate Offer). The end-game of these scams is unknown, but they probably just attempt to extract a small 'validation' sum out of the innocent buyer/seler from their hope of getting the big deal.58] Gold dust sellers - This scam persuades an investor there is real gold with a trial quantity, then eventually delivers brass filings or similar.   
:Counterfeit gold coins.   
:Shares in fraudulent mining companies with no gold reserves, or potential of finding gold,[59] as per the American. saying, atributed to Mark Twain but unsourced, that"A gold mine is a hole in the ground with a liar on top."|60]   
:  Cash for gold - With the rise in the value of gold due to the [financial crisis](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) of 2007-2010, there has been a surge in companies that will buy personal gold in exchange for cash, or sell investments in gold bullion and coins.  

Several of these have prolific marketing plans and high value spokesmen, such as prior vice presidents. Many of these companies are under investigation for a variety of securities fraud claims, as well as laundering money for. terrorist organizations [61 [62] [63 64] Also given that ownership is often not verified, many companies are considered to be receiving stolen property, and multiple laws are under consideration on methods to curtail. this.[65] [66]

# Credit default swap  

A [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) (CDS) is a swap. contract and agreement in which the [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) of the CDS makes a series of payments (often referred to as the CDS "fee" or "spread") to the [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md). and, in exchange, receives a payoff if a credit instrument (typically a bond or loan) experiences a [credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md). It is a form of reverse trading.  

In its simplest form, a [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) is a bilateral contract between the buyer and seller of protection. The CDS will refer to a "[reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md)" or "reference obligor", usually a corporation or government. The [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) is not a party to the contract. The [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) makes quarterly premium paymentsthe "spread"to the [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md). If the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md). defaults, the [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) pays the buyer the par value of the bond in exchange for physical delivery of the bond, although settlement may also be by cash or auction.11]. [2] A default is referred to as a "[credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md)" and includes such events as failure to pay, restructuring and bankruptcy.[2] Most CDSs are in the. $\$10â€“$ million range with maturities between one and 10 years.3]  

A holder of a bond may "buy protection" to hedge its risk of default. In this way, a CDS is similar to credit insurance, although CDS are not similar to or subject to regulations governing casualty or life insurance. Also, investors can buy and sell protection without

If the reference bond performs without default, the [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) pays quarterly payments to the seller until maturity

If the reference bond defaults, the [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) pays par value of the bond to the buyer, and the buyer physically delivers the bond to the seller.  

owning any debt of the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md). These "naked credit default swaps"' allow traders to speculate on debt issues and the creditworthiness of reference entities. Credit default swaps can be used to create synthetic [long and short positions](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Market%20Size%20and%20Participants.md) in the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md).4] Naked CDS constitute most of the market in CDs.15] [6] In addition, credit default swaps can also be used in [capital structure](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md) [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md).  

Credit default swaps have existed since the early 1990s, but the market increased tremendously starting in 2003. By the end of 2007, the outstanding amount was $\$62.2$ trillion, falling to $\$38.6$ trillion by the end of 2008.[7]  

Most CDSs are documented using standard forms promulgated by the International Swaps and [Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) Association (ISDA), although some are tailored to meet specific needs. Credit default swaps have many variations.2] In addition to the basic, single-name swaps, there are basket default swaps (BDS), index CDS, funded CDS (also called a credit linked notes), as well as loan only credit default swaps (LCDS). In addition to corporations or governments, the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) can include a [special purpose vehicle](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations.md) issuing [asset backed securities](Derivatives/Part%20X%20-%20Credit%20Derivatives/Chapter%2043%20-%20Securitisation,%20ABSs%20and%20CDOs.md).18]  

Credit default swaps are not traded on an exchange and there is no required reporting of transactions to a government. agency.9l During the 2007-2010 financial cisis the [lack of transparency](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Replication%20and%20Strategy%20Indexes.md) became a concern to regulators, as was the trillion dollar size of the market, which could pose a systemic risk to the economy.2] (4] [10] In March 2010, the. DTCC Trade Information Warehouse (see Sources of Market Data) announced it would voluntarily give regulators greater aces to ts credit default s waps database.11]

A "[credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md)" (CDS) is a credit derivative contract between two counterparties. The buyer makes periodic payments to the seller, and in return receives a payoff if an underlying financial instrument defaults or experiences a. similar crdi vent.1 12 12] The CDs may refer to a specified loan or bond obligation of a 'reference entityt. usully a corporation or government.31]  

As an example, imagine that an investor buys a CDS from AAA-Bank, where the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) is Risky Corp. The. investor-the buyer of protection-will make regular payments to AAA-Bank--the seller of protection. If Risky. Corp defaults on its debt, the investor will receive a one-time payment from AAA-Bank, and the CDS contract is terminated. A default is referred to as a "[credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md)" and include such events as failure to pay, restructuring and. bankruptcy.21] (9] cDS contracts on sovereign obligations also usually include as credit events repudiation, moratorium and acceleration.9]  

If the investor actually owns Risky Corp debt, the CDS can be thought of as [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md). But investors can also buy CDS contracts referencing Risky Corp debt without actually owning any Risky Corp debt. This may be done for. speculative purposes, to bet against the solvency of Risky Corp in a gamble to make money if it fails, or to hedge investments in other companies whose fortunes are expected to be similar to those of Risky (see Uses)..  

If the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) (Risky Corp) defaults, one of two kinds of settlement can occur:  

the investor delivers a defaulted asset to AAA-Bank for payment of the par value, which is known as [physical settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Futures%20and%20Forwards.md),   
:AAA-Bank pays the investor the difference between the par value and the market price of a specified debt obligation (even if Risky Corp defaults there is usually some recovery, i.e. not all your money will be lost), whicl. is known as [cash settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Swaptions.md).  

The "spread" of a CDS is the annual amount the [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) must pay the [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) over the length of the contract, expressed as a percentage of the notional amount. For example, if the [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) of Risky Corp is 50 basis points, or $0.5\%$ (1 basis point $=0.01\%$ ), then an investor buying. $\$10$ million worth of protection from AAA-Bank. must pay the bank $\$50,000$ per year. These payments continue until either the CDS contract expires or Risky Corp defaults. Payments are usually made on a quarterly basis, in arrears.  

Credit default swaps are not retail transactions. Most CDS's are in the $\$10-20$ million range with maturities between one and 10 years.3] Five years is the most typical maturity.8]  

All things being equal, at any given time, if the maturity of two credit default swaps is the same, then the CDS associated with a company with a higher [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) is considered more likely to default by the market, since a higher fee is being charged to protect against this happening. However, factors such as [liquidity](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) and estimated loss given default can affect the comparison. [Credit spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) rates and credit ratings of the underlying or reference obligations are considered among money managers to be the best indicators of the likelihood of sellers of CDSs having to perform under these contracts.2]  

# Not insurance  

CDS contracts have been compared with insurance, because the buyer pays a premium and, in return, receives a sum of money if one of the events specified in the contract occurs. However, there are a number of differences between CDS and insurance, for example:  

.The buyer of a CDS does not need to own the underlying security or other form of credit exposure; in fact the buer does not even have to sffer a ls rom te dealt vent 13] [1] 1s5 16 n ontrst, to purchase insurance. the insured is generally expected to have an insurable interest such as owning a debt obligation;.   
:the seller doesn't have to be a regulated entity;   
: the seller is not required to maintain any reserves to pay off buyers, although major CDS dealers are subject to bank capital requirements;   
. insurers manage risk primarily by setting loss reserves based on the Law of large numbers, while dealers in CDS manage risk primarily by means of offsetting CDS ([hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)) with other dealers and transactions in underlying. bond markets;   
: in the United States CDS contracts are generally subject to mark-to-market accounting, introducing income. statement and balance sheet volatility that would not be present in an insurance contract;   
:Hedge accounting may not be available under US [Generally Accepted Accounting Principles](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Accounting-%20Class%20Notes.md) (GAAP) unless the. requirements of FAs 133 17 are met. In practice this rarely hppens.  

However the most important difference between CDS and insurance is simply that an insurance contract provides an indemnity against the losses actually suffered by the policy holder, whereas the CDS provides an equal payout to all. holders, calculated using an agreed, market-wide method.  

There are also important differences in the approaches used to [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md). The cost of insurance is based on actuarial. analysis. CDSs are [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) whose cost is determined using financial models and by [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) relationships with other credit market instruments such as loans and bonds from the same '[Reference Entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md)' to which the CDS contract. refers.  

Further, to cancel the insurance contract the buyer can simply stop paying premium whereas in case of CDS the [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) may need to unwind the contract which might result in a profit or loss situation [Insurance contracts](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Risk%20Sharing.md) require the disclosure of all known risks involved. CDSs have no such requirement. Most. significantly, unlike insurance companies, sellers of CDSs are not required to maintain any capital reserves to guarantee payment of claims.  

# Risk  

When entering into s, bth the byer and selr f c procio ake on countarty risk21 18  

The buyer takes the risk that the seller will default. If AAA-Bank and Risky Corp. default simultaneously ("double default"), the buyer loses its protection against default by the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md). If AAA-Bank defaults but Risky Corp. does not, the buyer might need to replace the defaulted CDS at a higher cost.. The seller takes the risk that the buyer will default on the contract, depriving the seller of the expected revenue. stream. More important, a seller normally limits its risk by buying offsetting protection from another party - that is, it hedges its exposure. If the original buyer drops out, the seller squares its position by either unwinding the hedge transaction or by selling a new CDS to a third party. Depending on market conditions, that may be at a. lower price than the original CDS and may therefore involve a loss to the seller..  

In the future, in the event that regulatory reforms require that CDS be traded and settled via a central exchange/clearing house, such as ICE TCC, there will no longer be 'counterparty risk', as the risk of the counterparty will be held with the central exchange/clearing house.  

As is true with other forms of over-the-counter derivative, CDS might involve [liquidity risk](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md). If one or both parties to a CDS contract must post collateral (which is common), there can be [margin calls](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md) requiring the posting of additional collateral. The required collateral is agreed on by the parties when the CDS is first issued. This margin amount may vary over the life of the CDS contract, if the market price of the CDS contract changes, or the credit rating of one of the parties changes.  

Another kind of risk for the seller of credit default swaps is jump risk or jump-to-[default risk](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md).2l A seller of a CDS could be collecting monthly premiums with little expectation that the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) may default. A default creates a sudden obligation on the protection sellers to pay millions, if not billions, of dollars to protection buyers.l18] This. risk is not present in other over-the-counter [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) .2] [18]  

# Sources of market data  

Data about the credit default swaps market is available from three main sources. Data on an annual and semiannual basis is available from the International Swaps and [Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) Association (ISDA) since $2001^{[19]}$ and from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) since 2004.[20] The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), through its global repository Trade Information Warehouse (TIw), provides weekly data but publicly available information goes back only one year.21l The numbers provided by each source do not always match because eachd provider uses different sampling methods. (2]  

According to DTCC, the Trade Information Warehouse maintains the only "global electronic database for virtually all CDS contracts outstanding in the marketplace.[2]  

The Office of the Comptroller of the [Currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) publishes quarterly credit derivative data about insured U.S commercial banks and trust companies. [23]  

# Uses  

Credit default swaps can be used by investors for speculation, [hedging and arbitrage](Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%201%20-%20Derivative%20Securities.md).  

# Speculation  

Credit default swaps allow investors to speculate on changes in CDS spreads of single names or of market indices such as the North American CDX index or the European [iTraxx](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Credit%20Derivative%20Indexes.md) index. An investor might believe that an entity's CDS spreads are too high or too low, relative to the entity's bond yields, and attempt to profit from that view by. entering into a trade, known as a [basis trade](Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md), that combines a CDS with a cash bond and an interest-rate swap..  

Finally, an investor might speculate on an entity's [credit quality](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Wellman%20Inc%20the%20Importance%20of%20Loan%20Covenants.md), since generally CDS spreads will increase as credit-worthiness declines, and decline as credit-worthiness increases. The investor might therefore buy CDS protection on a company to speculate that it is about to default. Alternatively, the investor might sell protection if it. thinks that the company's creditworthiness might improve. The investor selling the CDS is viewed as being "long" on the CDS and the credit, a if the investor owned the bond.141 8] In contrast, the investor who bought protection is "short" on the CDS and the underlying credit.4] (8l Credit default swaps opened up important new avenues to speculators. Investors could go long on a bond without any upfront cost of buying a bond; all the investor need do was promise to pay in the event of default.!24] [Shorting](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Short%20Selling.md) a bond faced difficult practical problems, such that [shorting](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Short%20Selling.md) was often not feasible; CDS made [shorting](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Short%20Selling.md) credit possible and popular.8] [24] Because the speculatr in either case does not own the bond, its position is said to be a synthetic long or short position.4]  

For example, a hedge fund believes that Risky Corp will soon default on its debt. Therefore, it buys $\$10$ million worth of CDS protection for two years from AAA-Bank, with Risky Corp as the reference entity, at a spread of 500 basis points $(=5\%)$ per annum.  

If Risky Corp does indeed default after, say, one year, then the hedge fund will have paid $\$500,000$ to AAA-Bank, but will then receive. $\$10$ million (assuming zero [recovery rate](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%203.md), and that AAA-Bank has the [liquidity](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md). to cover the loss), thereby making a profit. AAA-Bank, and its investors, will incur a. $\$9.5$ million loss minus. recovery unless the bank has somehow offset the position before the default.. However, if Risky Corp does not default, then the CDS contract will run for two years, and the hedge fund will have ended up paying. $\$1$ million, without any return, thereby making a loss. AAA-Bank, by selling protection,. has made $\$1$ million without any upfront [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).  

Note that there is a third possibility in the above scenario; the hedge fund could decide to liquidate its position after a certain period of time in an attempt to realise its gains or losses. For example:  

After 1 year, the market now considers Risky Corp more likely to default, so its [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) has widened from 500 to 1500 basis points. The hedge fund may choose to sell $\$10$ million worth of protection for 1 year to AAA-Bank at this higher rate. Therefore over the two years the hedge fund will pay the bank $2\%$ \* $\$10\mathrm\mathrm\{m i l l i o n=\$1$ million, but will receive $1^{*}15\%^{*}\$10m i l l i o n=\$1.5$ million, giving a total profit of $\$500,000$ In another scenario, after one year the market now considers Risky much less likely to default, so its [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) has tightened from 500 to 250 basis points. Again, the hedge fund may choose to sell $\$10$ million worth of protection for 1 year to AAA-Bank at this lower spread. Therefore over the two years the hedge fund will pay the bank $2^{*}5\%^{*}\$10m i l l i o n=\$1$ million, but will receive $1^{*}2.5\%^{*}\$510m i l l i o n=\$250,000$ giving a total loss of $\$750,000$ . This loss is smaller than the $\$1$ million loss that would have occurred if the second transaction had not been entered into.  

Transactions such as these do not even have to be entered into over the long-term. If Risky Corp's [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) had widened by just a couple of basis points over the course of one day, the hedge fund could have entered into an offsetting contract immediately and made a small profit over the life of the two CDS contracts.  

Credit default swaps are also used to structure [synthetic collateralized debt obligations](Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Pricing%20&%20Risk%20Management%20of%20Synthetic%20CDOs.md) (CDOs). Instead of owning bonds or loans, a [synthetic CDO](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Cred.md) gets credit exposure to a [portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of [fixed income](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Lecture%20Notes%20Bonds,%20%20Preferred%20Stock,%20%20and%20Structured%20Products.md) assets without owning those assets through the use of CDs.25] CDOs are viewed as complex and opaque [financial instruments](../Financial%20Instruments/A%20Practical%20Guide%20for%20Actuaries%20and%20other%20Business%20Professionals..md). An example of ad [synthetic CDO](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Cred.md) is Abacus 2007-AC1 which is the subject of the civil suit for fraud brought by the SEC against Goldman Sachs in April 2010.26] Abacus is a [synthetic CDO](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Cred.md) consisting of credit default swaps referencing a variety. of mortgage backed securities.  

Naked credit default swaps. In the examples above, the hedge fund did not own debt of Risky Corp. A CDS in which the buyer does not own the underlying debt is referred to as a naked [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md), estimated to be up to $80\%$ of the [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) market.15 (6] There is currently a debate in the United States and Europe about whether speculative uses of credit default swaps should be banned. Legislation is under consideration by Congress as part of [financial reform](../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/Note%20on%20The%20Dodd-Frank%20Act%20and%20Its%20Impact.md). 16]  

Critics assert that naked CDS should be banned, comparing them to buying fire insurance on your neighbor's house,. which creates a huge incentive for arson. Analogizing to the concept of insurable interest, critics say you should not be able to buy a CDS-insurance against default--when you do not own the bond.27] [28] [29 Short elling is also viewed as gambling and the [CDS market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Credit%20Derivative%20Indexes.md) as a casino.16] [30] Another concern is the size of [CDS market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Credit%20Derivative%20Indexes.md). Because naked credit default swaps are synthetic, there is no limit to how many can be sold. The gross amount of CDS far exceeds all real" corporate bonds and oans outstanding 9 [28] As a result, the risk of default is magnified leading to concerns about systemic risk.[28]  

Financier George Soros called for an outright ban on naked credit default swaps, viewing them as "toxic" and allowing speculators to bet against and "bear raid" companies or countries.31] His concerns were echoed by several European politicians who, during the Greek [Financial Crisis](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md), accused naked CDS buyers as making the crisis WOrse.[32 [33]  

Despite these concerns, Secretary of Treasury Geithnerl6] [32] and [Commodity Futures](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md) Trading Commission Chairman Genslerl34 are not in favor of an outright ban of naked credit default swaps. They prefer greater transparency and better capitalization requirements.] 18] These fficials think that naked CDS have a place in the market.  

Proponents of naked credit default swaps say that short selling in various forms, whether credit default swaps, options or [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), has the beneficial effect of increasing [liquidity](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) in the marketplace.27] That benefits [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) activities. Without speculators buying and selling naked CDS, banks wanting to hedge might not find a ready seller of protection !o 27 Speculator alo create a more competitive marketplae eeping prices down for hedgers. robust market in credit default swaps can also serve as a barometer to regulators and investors about the credit health of a company or country [27] [35]  

Despite politicians' assertions that speculators are making the Greek crisis worse, Germany's market regulator BaFin found no proof supporting the claim.133] Some suggest that without credit default swaps, [Greece](../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/Solutions/PSET%203%20Solution-Financial%20Instruments.md)'s [borrowing costs](Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) would be higher.[33]  

# Hedging  

Credit default swaps are often used to manage the risk of default which arises from holding debt. A bank, for. example, may hedge its risk that a borrower may default on a loan by entering into a CDS contract as the buyer of protection. If the loan goes into default, the proceeds from the CDS contract will cancel out the losses on the. underlying debt.[3]  

There are other ways to eliminate or reduce the risk of default. The bank could sell (that is, assign) the loan outright. or bring in other banks as participants. However, these options may not meet the bank's needs. Consent of the. corporate borrower is often required. The bank may not want to incur the time and cost to find loan participants. If both the borrower and lender are well-known and the market (or even worse, the news media) learns that the bank is. selling the loan, then the sale may be viewed as signaling a lack of trust in the borrower, which could severely damage the banker-client relationship. In addition, the bank simply may not want to sell or share the potential profits. from the loan. By buying a [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md), the bank can lay off [default risk](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md) while still keeping the loan in its.  

[portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)!25J The downside to this hedge is that without [default risk](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md), a bank may have no motivation to actively monitor the loan and the counterparty has no relationship to the borrower.[25]  

Another kind of hedge is against concentration risk. A bank's [risk management](Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) team may advise that the bank is overly concentrated with a particular borrower or industry. The bank can lay off some of this risk by buying a CDS. Because the borrower--the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md)-is not a party to a [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md), entering into a CDS allows the bank to achieve its diversity objectives without impacting its loan [portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) or customer relations.2l Similarly, a bank. selling a CDS can diversify its [portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) by gaining exposure to an industry in which the selling bank has no. customer base.[3] [8] [36]  

A bank buying protection can also use a CDS to free regulatory capital. By offloading a particular [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md), a bank is not required to hold as much capital in reserve against the risk of default (traditionally $8\%$ of the total loan under Basel I). This frees resources which the bank can use to make other loans to the same key customer or to other borrowers.[2] [37]  

[Hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) risk is not limited to banks as lenders. Holders of corporate bonds, such as banks, pension funds or insurance companies, may buy a CDS as a hedge for similar reasons. [Pension fund](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) example: A [pension fund](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) owns five-year bonds issued by Risky Corp with par value of $\$10$ million. In order to manage the risk of losing money if Risky Corp defaults on its debt, the pension fund buys a CDS from Derivative Bank in a notional amount of $\$10$ million. The CDS trades at 200 basis points (200 basis points $=2.00$ percent). In return for this credit protection, the [pension fund](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) pays. $2\%$ of $\$10$ million $(\$200,000)$ per annum in quarterly installments of $\$50,000$ to Derivative Bank.  

.If Risky Corporation does not default on its bond payments, the [pension fund](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) makes quarterly payments to. Derivative Bank for 5 years and receives its. $\$10$ million back after five years from Risky Corp. Though the. protection payments totaling $\$1$ million reduce [investment returns](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Long%20Term%20Capital%20Management%20L.p.%20(a).md) for the [pension fund](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md), its risk of loss due to. Risky Corp defaulting on the bond is eliminated.   
:If Risky Corporation defaults on its debt three years into the CDS contract, the [pension fund](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) would stop paying. the quarterly premium, and Derivative Bank would ensure that the [pension fund](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) is refunded for its loss of $\$10$ million minus recovery (either by physical or cash settlement - see Settlement below). The pension fund still loses the $\$600,000$ it has paid over three years, but without the CDS contract it would have lost the entire. $\$10$ million minus recovery.  

In addition to [financial institutions](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md), large suppliers can use a [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) on a public bond issue or a basket of similar risks as a proxy fr its own [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) exposure on receivables.6] [27 (3] [38]  

Although credit default swaps have been highly criticized for their role in the recent [financial crisis](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md), most observers conclude that using credit default swaps as a [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) device has a useful purpose [27]  

# Arbitrage  

[Capital Structure](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md) [Arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) is an example of an [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) strategy that utilizes CDS transactions 39] This technique relies on the fact that a company's [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) and its [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) should exhibit negative correlation; i.e. if the outlook for a company improves then its share price should go up and its [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) should tighten, since it is less likely to default on its debt. However if its outlook worsens then its [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) should widen and its [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) should fall. Techniques reliant on this are known as [capital structure](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md) [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) because they exploit market inefficiencies between different parts of the same company's [capital structure](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md); i.e. mis-pricings between a company's [debt and equity](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/I-%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20Markets%20and%20Intermediation/I-%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20Markets%20and%20Intermediation/Class%20Note%201-%20Borrower-Lender%20conflicts%20and%20implied%20agency%20problems.md). An arbitrageur will attempt to exploit the spread between a company's CDS and its equity in certain situations. For example, if a company has announced some bad news and its share price has dropped by $25\%$ , but its [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) has remained unchanged, then an investor might expect the [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) to increase relative to the share price. Therefore a basic strategy would be to go long on the [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) (by buying CDS protection) while simultaneously [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) oneself by buying the underlying stock. This technique would benefit in the event of the [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) widening relative to the equity price, but would lose money if the company's [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) tightened  

relative to its equity.  

An interesting situation in which the inverse correlation between a company's [stock price](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) and [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) breaks down is during a [Leveraged buyout](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2014%20-%20Private%20Equity,%20Pension,%20and%20Sovereign%20Funds/Private%20Equity.md) (LBO). Frequently this will lead to the company's [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) widening due to the extra debt that will soon be put on the company's books, but also an increase in its share price, since buyers of a. company usually end up paying a premium.

# History  

# Conception  

Forms of credit default swaps had been in existence from at least the early 1990s, [40] with early trade carried out by Bankers Trust in 1991.(41] [J.P. Morgan](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/WSJ-Excerpts%20From%20the%20Lehman%20Report.md) & Co. is widely credited withcreating the modern [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) in 1994.[42] [43] [4] In that instance, J.P Morgan had extended a $\$4.8$ billion credit ie to Exxon, which faced the threat of $\$5$ billion in punitive damages for the Exxon Valdez oil spill. A team of [J.P. Morgan](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/WSJ-Excerpts%20From%20the%20Lehman%20Report.md) bankers led by Blythe Masters then sold the [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) from the credit line to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development in order to cut the reserves which [J.P. Morgan](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/WSJ-Excerpts%20From%20the%20Lehman%20Report.md) was required to hold against Exxon's default, thus improving its own balance sheet.45] In 1997, [JPMorgan](Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) developed a proprietary product called BISTRO (Broad Index Securitized Trust Offering) that used CDS to clean up a bank's balance sheet.42 [44] The advantage of BISTRO was that it used [securitization](10.%20Other%20Topics%20in%20Quantitative%20Finance.md) to split up the [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) into little pieces which smaller investors found more digestible, since most investors lacked EBRD's capability to accept $\$4.8$ billion in [credit risk](../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) all at once. BISTRO was the first example of what later became known as [synthetic collateralized debt obligations](Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Pricing%20&%20Risk%20Management%20of%20Synthetic%20CDOs.md) (CDOs).  

Mindful of the concentration of [default risk](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md) as one of the causes of the S&L crisis , regulators initially found CDS's ability to disperse [default risk](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md) atractive. [1] In 200, credit default swaps became largely exempt from regulation by both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the [Commodity Futures](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md) Trading Commission (CTFC).

[41]  

# Market growth  

At first, banks were the dominant players in the market, as CDS were primarily used to hedge risk in connection with its lending activities. Banks also saw an opportunity to free up regulatory capital. By march 1998, the global market for CDS was estimated atabout $\$300$ billion, with JP Morgan alone accounting for about $\$50$ billion of this. [41] The high market share enjoyed by the banks was soon eroded as more and more asset managers and [hedge funds](Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) saw trading opportunities in credit default swaps. By 2002, investors as speculators, rather than banks as hedgers, dominated the market.21 [8 [37] [40] National banks in the USA used credit default swaps as early as 1996.[36 n that year, the Office of the Comptrller of the [Currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) measured the size of the market as tens of billions of dollars.[46] Six years later, by year-end 2002, the outstanding amount was over $\$2$ trillion.!7 Although speculators fueled the exponential growth, other factors also played a part. An extended market could not emerge until 1999, when ISDA standardized the doumentation for credit default swaps 47] [48 [49] lso, the 1997 Asian [Financial Crisis](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) spurred a market for CDS in emerging market sovereign debt.49] In addition, in 2004, index trading began on a large scale and grew rapidly.[8]  

The market size for Credit Default Swaps more than doubled in size each year from $\$3.7$ trillion in 2003.!7 By the end of 2007, the CDS market had a notional value of $\$62.2$ trillion.! But notional amount fell during 2008 as a result of dealer "[portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) compression" efforts (replacing offsetting redundant contracts), and by the end of 2008 notional amount outstandig had fllen 38 percent to \$38.6 tillion.[50]  

Explosive growth was not without operational headaches. On September 15, 2005, the New York Fed summoned 14 banks to it offices. Billions of dollars of CDS were traded daily but the record keeping was more than two weeks. behind.51] This created severe [risk management](Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) isues, as counterarties were in legl and fincial limbo.8] [52] U.K. authorities expressed the same concerns.[53]  

# Market as of 2008  

Since default is a relatively rare occurrence (historically around $0.2\%$ of [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) grade companies will default in any one year),[54] in most CDS contracts the only payments are the premium payments. from buyer to seller. Thus, although the above figures for outstanding. notionals are very large, in the absence of default the net cashflows will only be a small fraction of this total: for a. $100\:\mathrm{bp}=1\%$ spread, the annual cash flows are only. $1\%$ of the notional amount..  

# Regulatory concerns over CDS  

The market for Credit Default Swaps attracted considerable concern from regulators after a number of large scale incidents in 2008, starting with the collapse of [Bear Stearns](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/The%20Fall%20of%20Bear%20Stearns.md).55]  

In the days and weeks leading up to Bear's collapse, the bank's [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) widened dramatically, indicating a surge of buyers taking out protection on the bank. It has been suggested that this widening was responsible for the perception that [Bear Stearns](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/The%20Fall%20of%20Bear%20Stearns.md) was vulnerable, and therefore restricted its access to wholesale capital which eventually led to its forced sale to [JP Morgan](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/The%20Fall%20of%20Bear%20Stearns.md) in March. An alternative, unsupported view is that this surge in CDS protection buyers was a symptom rather than a cause of Bear's collapse; i.e., investors saw that Bear was in trouble, and sought to hedge any naked exposure to the bank, or speculate on its collapse.  

In September, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers caused a total close to $\$400$ billion to become payable to the buyers of CDS protection referenced against the insolvent bank. However the net amount that changed hands was around $\$7.2$ billion[56] This difference is due to the process of 'netting'. Market participants co-operated so that CDS sellers. were allowed to deduct from their payouts the inbound funds due to them from their [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) positions. Dealers generally attempt to remain

risk-neutral so their losses and gains after big events will on the whole offset each other.  

Also in September American International Group (AIG) required a federal bailout because it had been excessively selling CDS protection without [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) against the possibility that the reference entities might decline in value, which exposed the insurance giant to potential losses over $\$100$ billion. The CDS on Lehman were settled smoothly, as was largely the case for the other 11 credit events occurring in 2008 which trggered payouts.55] And while it is arguable that other incidents would have been as bad or worse if less efficient instruments than CDS had been used for [speculation and insurance](Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2014%20-%20Options%20Markets.md) purposes, the closing months of 2008 saw regulators working hard to reduce the risk involved in CDS transactions.  

In 2008 there was no centralized exchange or clearing house for CDS transactions; they were all done over the counter (OTC). This led to recent calls for the market to open up in terms of transparency and regulation.57] In November, DTCC, which runs a warehouse for CDS trade confirmations accounting for around $90\%$ of the total market,58] anounced that it wil release market data on the outstanding notional of CDS trades on a weekly basis.59] The data can beaccessed on the DTCC's websitehere:!60 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission granted an exemption for IntercontinentalExchange to begin guaranteeing credit-default swaps.  

The SEC exemption represented the last regulatory approval needed by Atlanta-based Intercontinental. Its larger competitor, CME Group Inc., hasn't received an SEC exemption, and agency spokesman John Nester said he didn't know when a decision would be made.  

# Market as of 2009  

The early months of 2009 saw several fundamental changes to the way CDSs operate, resulting from concerns over the instruments' safety after the events of the previous year. According to Deutsche Bank managing director. Athanassios Diplas "the industry pushed through 10 years worth of changes in just a few months" By late 2008 processes had been introduced allowing CDSs which offset each other to be cancelled. Along with termination of contracts that have recently paid out such as those based on Lehmans, this had by March reduced the face value of the market down to an estimated $\$30$ trillion.[61] The Bank for International Settlements estimates that outstanding derivatives total $\$592$ trillion.[62] U.S. and European regulators are developing separate plans to stabilize the [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) market. Additionally there are some globally agreed standards falling into place in March 2009, administered by International Swaps and [Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) Association (ISDA). Two of the key changes are:  

1. The [introduction](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Introduction.md) of central clearing houses, one for the US and one for Europe. A clearing house acts as the central counterparty to both sides of a CDS transaction, thereby reducing the counterparty risk that both buyer and seller face.  

2. The international standardization of CDS contracts, to prevent legal disputes in ambiguous cases where what the payout should be is unclear.  

Speaking before the changes went live , Sivan Mahadevan, a [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) strategist at [Morgan Stanley](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md) in New York, Stated  

A clearinghouse, and changes to the contracts to standardize them, will probably boost activity. .. Trading will be much easier.. We'll see new players come to the market because theyl like the ide of this being a beter and more traded product. We also ee like over ime wel 5 J see the creation of different types of products.  

In the U.S., central clearing operations began in March 2009 , operated by InterContinental Exchange (ICE). A key competitor also interested in entering the CDS clearing sector is CME Group.  

In Europe, CDS Index clearing was launched by ICE's European subsidiary ICE Clear Europe on July 31. It. launched Single Name clearing in Dec 2009. By the end of 2009, it had cleared CDS contracts worth EUR 885 billion reducing the open interest down to EUR 75 billion [63]  

By the end of 2009, banks had reclaimned much of their market share; [hedge funds](Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) had largely retreated from the market after the crises. According to an estimate by the Banque de France, by late 2009 the bank [JP Morgan](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/The%20Fall%20of%20Bear%20Stearns.md) alone now had about 30% of the global [CDS market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Credit%20Derivative%20Indexes.md). [41]  

# Government approvals relating to Intercontinental and its competitor CME  

The SEC's approval for ICE's request to be exempted from rules that would prevent it clearing CDSs was the third government action granted to Intercontinental in one week. On March 3, its proposed acquisition of Clearing Corp., a. Chicago clearinghouse owned by eight of the largest dealers in the credit-default swap market, was approved by the. Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. On March 5, the Federal Reserve Board, which oversees the clearinghouse, granted a request for ICE to begin clearing.  

Clearing Corp. shareholders including [JPMorgan Chase](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Case%20Study%20of%20JP%20Morgan.md) & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG, received $\$39$ million in cash from Intercontinental in the acquisition, as well as the Clearing Corp.'s cash on hand and a 50-50 profit-sharing agreement with Intercontinental on the revenue generated from processing the swaps.  

SEC spokesperson John Nestor stated  

For several months the SEC and our fellow regulators have worked closely with all of the firms wishing to establish central counterparties.. We believe that CME should be in a position soon to provide us with the information necessary to allow the commission to take action on its 9 J exemptive requests.  

Other proposals to clear credit-default swaps have been made by NYSE Euronext, Eurex AG and LCH.Clearnet Ltd. Only the NYSE effort is available now for clearing after starting on Dec. 22. As of Jan. 30, no swaps had been cleared by the NYSE's London- based [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) exchange, according to NYSE Chief Executive Officer Duncan Niederauer.[64]  

# Clearing house member requirements  

Members of the Intercontinental clearinghouse will have to have a net worth of at least. $\$5$ billion and a credit rating of A or better to clear their credit-default swap trades. Intercontinental said in the statement today that all market participants such as [hedge funds](Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md), banks or other institutions are open to become members of the clearinghouse as. long as they meet these requirements.  

A clearinghouse acts as the buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer, reducing the risk of a counterparty. defaulting on a transaction. In the [over-the-counter market](Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20%20Pricing%20of%20Caps%20and%20Floors.md), where credit- default swaps are currently traded, participants are exposed to each other in case of a default. A clearinghouse also provides one location for regulators to view traders' positions and prices.  

# Terms of a typical CDS contract  

A CDS contract is typically documented under a confirmation referencing the [credit derivatives](../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) definitions as published by the International Swaps and [Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) Association.65] The confirmation typically specifies a [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md), a corporation or sovereign that generally, although not always, has debt outstanding, and a reference obligation, usually an unsubordinated corporate bond or government bond. The period over which default protection extends is defined by the contract effective date and scheduled termination date.  

The confirmation also specifies a calculation agent who is responsible for making determinations as to successors and substitute reference obligations (for example necessary if the original reference obligation was a loan that is repaid before the expiry of the contract), and for performing various calculation and administrative functions in connection with the transaction. By market convention, in contracts between CDS dealers and end-users, the dealer is generally the calculation agent, and in contracts between CDS dealers, the [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) is generally the calculation agent. It is not the responsibility of the calculation agent to determine whether or not a [credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) has occurred but rather a matter of fact that, pursuant to the terms of typical contracts, must be supported by publicly available information delivered along with a [credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) notice. Typical CDS contracts do not provide an internal mechanism for challenging the occurrence or non-occurrence of a [credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) and rather leave the matter to the courts if necessary, though actual instances of specific events being disputed are relatively rare.  

CDS confirmations also specify the credit events that will give rise to payment obligations by the [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) and delivery obligations by the [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md). Typical credit events include bankruptcy with respect to the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) and failure to pay with respect to its direct or guaranteed bond or loan debt. CDS written on North American [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) grade corporate reference entities, European corporate reference entities and sovereigns generally also include restructuring as a [credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md), whereas trades referencing North American high yield corporate reference entities typically do not. The definition of restructuring is quite technical but is essentially intended to respond to circumstances where a [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md), as a result of the deterioration of its credit, negotiates changes in the terms in its debt with its creditors as an alternative to formal insolvency proceedings (i.e., the debt is restructured). This practice is far more typical in jurisdictions that do not provide protective status to insolvent debtors similar to that provided by Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. In particular, concerns arising out of Conseco's restructuring in 2000 led to the [credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md)'s removal from North American high yield trades.[66]  

Finally, standard CDS contracts specify deliverable obligation characteristics that limit the range of obligations that a [protection buyer](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) may deliver upon a [credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md). Trading conventions for deliverable obligation characteristics. vary for different markets and CDS contract types. Typical limitations include that deliverable debt be a bond or. loan, that it have a maximum maturity of 30 years, that it not be subordinated, that it not be subject to transfer restrictions (other than Rule 144A), that it be of a standard [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) and that it not be subject to some contingency. before becoming due.  

The premium payments are generally quarterly, with maturity dates (and likewise premium payment dates) falling on March 20, June 20, September 20, and December 20. Due to the proximity to the IMM dates, which fall on the third Wednesday of these months, these CDS maturity dates are also referred to as "IMM dates".  

# Settlement  

# Physical or cash  

As described in an earlier section, if a [credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) occurs then CDS contracts can either be physically settled or cash Settled. [2]  

[Physical settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Futures%20and%20Forwards.md): The [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) pays the buyer par value, and in return takes delivery of a debt obligation of the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md). For example, a hedge fund has bought $\$5$ million worth of protection from a. bank on the senior debt of a company. In the event of a default, the bank will pay the hedge fund $\$5$ million cash, and the hedge fund must deliver $\$5$ million face value of senior debt of the company (typically bonds or loans,. which will typically be worth very little given that the company is in default).   
. [Cash settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Swaptions.md): The [protection seller](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) pays the buyer the difference between par value and the market price of a debt obligation of the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md). For example, a hedge fund has bought $\$5$ million worth of protection from. a bank on the senior debt of a company. This company has now defaulted, and its senior bonds are now trading at 25 (i.e. 25 cents on the dollar) since the market believes that senior bondholders will receive $25\%$ of the money they are owed once the company is wound up. Therefore, the bank must pay the hedge fund $\$5$ million \* $(100\%-25\%)=\$3.75$ million.  

The development and growth of the [CDS market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Credit%20Derivative%20Indexes.md) has meant that on many companies there is now a much larger outstanding notional of CDS contracts than the outstanding notional value of its debt obligations. (This is because many parties made CDS contracts for speculative purposes, without actually owning any debt for which they wanted to insure against default.) For example, at the time it filed for bankruptcy on September 14, 2008, Lehman Brothers had approximately $\$155$ billion of outstanding debt'67] but around $\$400$ billion notional value of CDS contracts had been written which referenced this debt.!68] Clearly not all of these contractscould be physically settled, since there. was not enough outstanding Lehman Brothers debt to fulfill all of the contracts, demonstrating the necessity for cash settled CDS trades. The trade confirmation produced when a CDS is traded will state whether the contract is to be physically or cash settled.  

# Auctions  

When a [credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) occurs on a major company on which a lot of CDS contracts are written, an auction (also known as a credit-fixing event) may be held to facilitate settlement of a large number of contracts at once, at a fixed [cash settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Swaptions.md) price. During the [auction process](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%202%20Securities%20Markets.md) participating dealers (e.g., the big [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) banks) submit prices at which they would buy and sell the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md)'s debt obligations, as well as net requests for [physical settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Futures%20and%20Forwards.md) against par. A second stage Dutch auction is held following the publication of the initial mid-point of the dealer markets and what is the net open interest to deliver or be delivered actual bonds or loans. The final clearing point of. this auction sets the final price for [cash settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Swaptions.md) of all CDS contracts and all [physical settlement requests](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/CDS%20Settlement%20Auctions.md) as well as matched limit offers resulting from the auction are actually settled. According to the International Swaps and [Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) Association (ISDA), who organised them, auctions have recently proved an effective way of settling the. very large volume of outstanding CDS contracts written on companies such as Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual.[69]

# Pricing and valuation  

There are two competing theories usually advanced for the [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) of credit default swaps. The first, referred to herein as the '[probability model](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%202%20-%20Uncertainty,%20Information,%20and%20Stochastic%20Processes/Probability%20Space.md)', takes the present value of a series of cashflows weighted by their probability of non-default. This method suggests that credit default swaps should trade at a considerably lower spread than corporate bonds.  

The second model, proposed by Darrell Duffie, but also by John Hull and White, uses a no-[arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) approach.  

# Probability model  

Under the [probability model](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%202%20-%20Uncertainty,%20Information,%20and%20Stochastic%20Processes/Probability%20Space.md), a [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) is priced using a model that takes four inputs; this is similar to the rNPV (risk-adjusted NPV) model used in drug development:  

the "issue premium",   
the [recovery rate](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%203.md) (percentage of notional repaid in event of default),   
the "[credit curve](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20PSETS/Advanced%20Usage%20of%20QuantLib%20analytics%20library.md)" for the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) and the "LIBOR curve".  

If default events never occurred the price of a CDS would simply be the sum of the discounted premium payments. So [CDS pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Copulas%20and%20the%20Modeling%20of%20Default%20Correlatio.md) models have to take into account the possibility of a default occurring some time between the effective date and maturity date of the CDS contract. For the purpose of explanation we can imagine the case of a one year CDS with effective date $t_{0}$ with four quarterly premium payments occurring at times $t_{1},t_{2},t_{3}$ , and $t_{4}$ If the nominal for the CDS is $N$ and the issue premium is $^c$ then the size of the quarterly premium payments is. $N c/4$ . If we assume for simplicity that defaults can only occur on one of the payment dates then there are five. ways the contract could end:  

either it does not have any default at all, so the four premium payments are made and the contract survives until the maturity date, or   
a default occurs on the first, second, third or fourth payment date.  

To price the CDS we now need to assign probabilities to the five [possible outcomes](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%202%20-%20Uncertainty,%20Information,%20and%20Stochastic%20Processes/Probability%20Space.md), then calculate the present value of the payoff for each outcome. The present value of the CDS is then simply the present value of the five payoffs multiplied by their probability of occurring.  

This is illustrated in the following tree diagram where at each payment date either the contract has a default event, in which case it ends with a payment of $N(1-R)$ shown in red, where $R$ is the [recovery rate](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%203.md), or it survives without a default being triggered, in which case a premium payment of $N c/4$ is made, shown in blue. At either side of the diagram are the cashflows up to that point in time with premium payments in blue and default payments in red. If the contract is terminated the square is shown with solid shading.  

![](c36fa8a084b43ba24f416f0597d094967fd7f0e5c11ce69519db08608e1e9eb7.jpg)  

The probability of surviving over the interval. $t_{i-1}$ to $t_{i}$ without a default payment is $p_{i}$ and the probability of a default being triggered is $1-p_{i}$ . The calculation of present value, given [discount factor](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%201/Discount%20Factors.md) of $\delta_{1}$ to $\delta_{4}$ is then

The probabilities $ p_{1},p_{2},p_{3}$ $p.$ 4can be calculated using the [credit spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) curve. The probability of no default. occurring over a time period from $t$ to $t+\Delta t$ decays exponentially with a time-constant determined by the [credit spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md), or mathematically $p=e x p(-s(t)\Delta t/(1-R))$ where $s(t)$ is the [credit spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) zero curve at time $t$ The riskier the [reference entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) the greater the spread and the more rapidly the [survival probability](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/A%20Poisson%20Model%20of%20Single%20Issuer%20Default.md) decays with time. To get the total present value of the [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) we multiply the probability of each outcome by its present value to give.

# No-arbitrage model  

In the 'no-[arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md)' model proposed by both Duffie, and Hull-White, it is assumed that there is no risk free [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md). Duffie uses the LIBOR as the risk free rate, whereas Hull and White use [US Treasuries](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20PSETS/Credit%20Market%20Homework%201.md) as the risk free rate. Both analyses make simplifying assumptions (such as the assumption that there is zero cost of unwinding the [fixed leg](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) of the swap on default), which may invalidate the no-[arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) assumption. However the Duffie approach is frequently used by the market to determine theoretical prices. Under the Duffie construct, the price of a [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) can also be derived by calculating the [asset swap](Derivatives/Part%20VIII%20-%20Swaps/Chapter%2037%20-%20Equity%20Swaps.md) spread of a bond. If a bond has a spread of 100, and the swap spread is 70 basis points, then a CDS contract should trade at 30. However there are sometimes technical reasons why this will not be the case, and this may or may not present an [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) opportunity for the canny investor. The difference between the theoretical model and the actual price of a [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) is known as the basis.  

# Criticisms  

Critics of the huge [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) market have claimed that it has been allowed to become too large without proper regulation and that, because all contracts are privately negotiated, the market has no transparency. Furthermore, there have even been claims that CDSs exacerbated the 2008 [global financial crisis](8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) by hastening the demise of companies such as Lehman Brothers and AIG.[74]  

In the case of Lehman Brothers, it is claimed that the widening of the bank's [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) reduced confidence in the bank and ultimately gave it further problems that it was not able to overcome. However, proponents of the [CDS market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Credit%20Derivative%20Indexes.md) argue that this confuses cause and effect; CDS spreads simply reflected the reality that the company was in serious trouble. Furthermore, they claim that the [CDS market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Credit%20Derivative%20Indexes.md) allowed investors who had counterparty risk with. Lehman Brothers to reduce their exposure in the case of their default.  

Credit default swaps have also faced criticism that they contributed to a breakdown in negotiations during the 2009 General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization, because bondholders would benefit from the [credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) of a GM bankruptcy due to their holding of CDSs. Critics speculate that these creditors were incentivized into pushing for the. company to enter bankruptcy protection.75] Due to a [lack of transparency](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Replication%20and%20Strategy%20Indexes.md), there was no way to find out who the protection buyers and protection writers were, and they were subsequently left out of the negotiation process.[76]  

It was also reported after Lehman's bankruptcy that the. $\$400$ billion notional of CDS protection which had been written on the bank could lead to a net payout of. $\$366$ billion from protection sellers to buyers (given the cash-settlement auction settled at a final price of $8.625\%$ ) and that these large payouts could lead to further bankruptcies of firms without enough cash to settle their contracts.77] However, industry estimates after the auction suggested that net cashflows would only be in the region of $\$7$ billion.77] This is because many parties held offsetting positions; for example if a bank writes CDS protection on a company it is likely to then enter an offsetting transaction by buying protection on the same company in order to hedge its risk. Furthermore, CDS deals are marked-to-market frequently. This would have led to [margin calls](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md) from buyers to sellers as Lehman's [CDS spread](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2014/Cds-Equivalent%20Bond%20Spread.md) widened, meaning that the net cashflows on the days after the auction are likely to have been even lower.[69] ... Senior bankers have argued that not only has the [CDS market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Credit%20Derivative%20Indexes.md) functioned remarkably well during the [financial crisis](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md), but that CDS contracts have been acting to distribute risk just as was intended, and that it is not CDSs themselves that need further regulation, but the parties who trade them 78]  

Some general criticism of [financial derivatives](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md) is also relevant to [credit derivatives](../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md). Warren [Buffett](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Warren%20Buffet%20Case%20Study.md) famously described [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) bought speculatively as "financial weapons of mass destruction." In Berkshire Hathaway's annual report to shareholders in 2002, he said, "Unless [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) contracts are collateralized or guaranteed, their. ultimate value also depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparties to them. In the meantime, though, before a contract is settled, the counterparties record profits and losses-often huge in amount-in their current earnings statements without so much as a penny changing hands. The range of [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) contracts is limited only by the. imagination of man (or sometimes, so it seems, madmen)."[79] To hedge the counterparty risk of entering a CDS transaction, one practice is to buy CDS protection on one's counterparty. The positions are marked-to-market daily and collateral pass from buyer to seller or vice versa to protect both parties against counterparty default, but money does not always change hands due to the offset of gains and losses by those who had both bought and sold protection. Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the clearinghouse for the majority of trades in the US. [over-the-counter market](Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20%20Pricing%20of%20Caps%20and%20Floors.md), stated in October 2008 that once offsetting trades were considered, only an estimated. $\$6$ billion would change hands on October 21, during the settlement of the CDS contracts issued on Lehman Brothers' debt, which amounted to somewhere between $\$150$ to $\$360$ billion.[80] Despite Buffet's criticism on derivatives, in October 2008 Berkshire Hathaway revealed to regulators that it has entered into at least $\$4.85$ billion in derivative transactions.81l [Buffett](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Warren%20Buffet%20Case%20Study.md) stated in his 2008 letter to shareholders that Berkshire Hathaway has no. counterparty risk in its derivative dealings because Berkshire require counterparties to make payments when contracts are initited, so that Berkshire always holds the money.82] Berkshire Hathaway was a large owner of Moody's stock during the period that it was one of two primary rating agencies for subprime CDOs, a form of mortgage security derivative dependant on the use of credit default swaps.  

The monoline insurance companies got involved with writing credit default swaps on mortgage-backed CDOs. Some media reports have claimed this was a contributing factor to the downfall of some of the monolines.!83] [84] In 2009 one of the monolines, MBIA, sued Merrill Lynch, claiming that Merill had misrepresented some of its CDOs to MBIA in order to persuade MBIA to write CDS protection for those CDOs.[85] [86] [87]  

# Systemic risk  

The risk of counterparties defaulting has been amplified during the 2008 [financial crisis](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md), particularly because. Lehman Brothers and AIG were counterparties in a very large number of CDS transactions. This is an example of systemic risk, risk which threatens an entire market, and a number of commentators have argued that size and deregulation of the [CDS market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Credit%20Derivative%20Indexes.md) have increased this risk..  

For example, imagine if a hypothetical mutual fund had bought some Washington Mutual corporate bonds in 2005 and decided to hedge their exposure by buying CDS protection from Lehman Brothers. After Lehman's default, this protection was no longer active, and Washington Mutual's sudden default only days later would have led to a massive loss on the bonds, a loss that should have been insured by the CDs. There was also fear that Lehman. Brothers and AIG's inability to pay out on CDS contracts would lead to the unraveling of complex interlinked chain of CDS transactions between [financial institutions](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md).!88] So far this does not apear to have happened, although some commentators have noted that because the total CDS exposure of a bank is not public knowledge, the fear that one. could face large losses or possibly even default themselves was a contributing factor to the massive decrease in 1ending [liquidity](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) during September/October 2008.189]  

Chains of CDS transactions can arise from a practice known as "nettin" 90] Here, company B may buy a CDS from company A with a certain annual "premium", say. $2\%$ . If the condition of the reference company worsens, the risk. premium will rise, so company B can sell a CDS to company C with a premium of say, $5\%$ , and pocket the $3\%$ difference. However, if the reference company defaults, company B might not have the assets on hand to make good. on the contract. It depends on its contract with company A to provide a large payout, which it then passes along to company C. The problem lies if one of the companies in the chain fails, creating a "domino effect" of losses. For example, if company A fails, company B will default on its CDS contract to company C, possibly resulting in bankruptcy, and company C will potentially experience a large loss due to the failure to receive compensation for the bad debt it held from the reference company. Even worse, because CDS contracts are private, company C will not. Know that its fate is tied to company A; it is only doing business with company B.  

As described above, the establishment of a central exchange or clearing house for CDS trades would help to solve the "domino effect" problem, since it would mean that all trades faced a central counterparty guaranteed by a consortium of dealers.  

# Tax and accounting issues  

The U.S federal income tax treatment of credit default swaps i uncertin.9 Commentators generally believe that, depending on how they are drafted, they are either [notional principal](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%204%20-%20Swap%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Swaps.md) contracts or options for tax purposes,92] but this is not certain. There is a risk of having credit default swaps recharacterized as different types of [financial instruments](../Financial%20Instruments/A%20Practical%20Guide%20for%20Actuaries%20and%20other%20Business%20Professionals..md) because they resemble put options and credit guarantees. In particular, the degree of risk depends on the type of settlement (physical/cash and binary/FMV) and trigger (default only/any [credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md)).[93] If a [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) is a [notional principal](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%204%20-%20Swap%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Swaps.md) contract, periodic and nonperiodic payments on the swap are deductible and included in ordinary income.94] 1f a payment is a termination payment, it tax treatment is even more uncertain.94 $^{1}\ln2004$ , the Internal Revenue Service announced that it was studying the characterization of credit default swaps in response to taxpayer confusion,95] but it has not yet ssued any guidance on their characterization. A taxpayer must include income from credit default swaps in ordinary income if the swaps are connected with trade or business in the United States.[96]  

The accounting treatment of Credit Default Swaps used for [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) may not parallel the economic effects and instead, increase volatility. For example, GAAP generally require that Credit Default Swaps be reported on a [mark to market](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md) basis. In contrast, assets that are held for [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), such as a commercial loan or bonds, are reported at cost, unless a probable and significant loss is expected. Thus, [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) a commercial loan using a CDS can induce considerable volatility into the income statement and balance sheet as the CDS changes value over its life due to market conditions and due to the tendency for shorter dated CDS to sell at lower prices than longer dated CDS. One can try to account for the CDS as a hedge under FASB $133^{[97]}$ but in practice that can prove very difficul unles the risky asset owned by the bank or corporation is exactly the same as the Reference Obligation used for the particular CDS that was bought.  

# LCDS  

A new type of default swap is the "loan only" [credit default swap](../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) (LCDs). This is conceptually very similar to a. standard CDS, but unlike "vanilla" CDS, the underlying protection is sold on syndicated secured loans of the [Reference Entity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) rather than the broader category of "Bond or Loan". Also, as of May 22, 2007, for the most widely. traded LCDS form, which governs North American single name and index trades, the default settlement method for LCDS shifted to auction settlement rather than [physical settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Futures%20and%20Forwards.md). The auction method is essentially the same that. has been used in the various ISDA [cash settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Swaptions.md) auction protocols, but does not require parties to take any. additional steps following a [credit event](Valuation%20of%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) (i.e., adherence to a protocol) to elect [cash settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Swaptions.md). On October 23, 2007, the first ever LCDS auction was held for Movie Gallery.[98]  

Because LCDS trades are linked to secured obligations with much higher recovery values than the unsecured bond obligations that are typically assumed to be [cheapest to deliver](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/The%20Quality%20Option%20at%20Expiration.md) in respect of vanilla CDS, LCDS spreads are generally much tighter than CDS trades on the same name.

# Equity swap  

An [equity swap](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%204%20-%20Swap%20Markets/Equity%20Commodity%20and%20Exotic%20Swaps.md) is a financial derivative contract (a swap) where a set of [future cash flows](Advanced%20Derivatives%20Pricing%20Methodology.md) are agreed to be exchanged between two counterparties at set dates in the future. The two cash flows are usually referred to as "legs" of the swap; one of these "legs" is usually pegged to a floating rate such as LIBOR. This leg is also commonly referred to as the "[floating leg](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md)". The other leg of the swap is based on the performance of either a share of stock or a [stock market](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) index. This leg is commonly referred to as the "equity leg". Most equity swaps involve a [floating leg](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) vs. an equity leg, although some exist with two equity legs.  

An [equity swap](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%204%20-%20Swap%20Markets/Equity%20Commodity%20and%20Exotic%20Swaps.md) involves a [notional principal](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%204%20-%20Swap%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Swaps.md), a specified tenor and predetermined payment intervals.  

Equity swaps are typically traded by Delta One trading desks.  

# Examples  

Parties may agree to make periodic payments or a single payment at the maturity of the swap ("bullet" swap), the worst case.  

Take a simple index swap where Party A swaps 5,000,000 at $\mathrm{LIBOR}+0.03\%$ (also called $\operatorname{LIBOR}+3$ basis points) against 5,000,000 (FTSE to the 5,000,000 notional). In this case Party A will pay (to Party B) a floating interest rate (LIBOR $+0.03\%$ ) on the 5,ooo,o00 notional and would receive from Party B any percentage increase in the FTSE equity index applied to the 5,000,000 notional..  

In this example, assuming a LIBOR rate of $5.97\%$ p.a. and a swap tenor of precisely 180 days, the [floating leg](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) payer/equity receiver (Party A) would owe $(5.97\%+0.03\%)^{*}Â£,000,000^{*}180/360=Â£150,000$ to the equity payer/[floating leg](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) receiver (Party B).  

At the same date (after 180 days) if the FTSE had appreciated by. $10\%$ from its level at trade commencement, Party. B would owe $10\%{*Â£}Â£,000,000=Â£500,000$ to Party A. If, on the other hand, the FTSE at the six-month mark had fallen by $10\%$ from its level at trade commencement, Party A would owe an additional $10\%{*Â£}Â£,000,000=Â£500,000$ to Party B, since the flow is negative..  

For mitigating credit exposure, the trade can be reset, or "marked-to-market" during its life. In that case, appreciation or depreciation since the last reset is paid and the notional is increased by any payment to the [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) rate payer or decreased by any payment from the [floating leg](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) payer.  

# Applications  

Typically Equity Swaps are entered into in order to avoid transaction costs (including Tax), to avoid locally based dividend taxes, limitations on [leverage](../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) (notably the US margin regime) or to get around rules governing the particular type of [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) that an institution can hold..  

Equity Swaps also provide the following benefits over plain vanilla equity investing:  

1. An investor in a physical holding of shares loses possession on the shares once he sells his position. However, using an [equity swap](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%204%20-%20Swap%20Markets/Equity%20Commodity%20and%20Exotic%20Swaps.md) the investor can pass on the negative [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on equity position without losing the possession of the shares and hence voting rights. For example, let's say A holds 100 shares of a Petroleum Company. As the price of crude falls the investor believes the stock would start giving him negative [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) in the short run. However, his holding gives him a strategic voting right in the board which he does not want to lose. Hence, he enters into an. [equity swap](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%204%20-%20Swap%20Markets/Equity%20Commodity%20and%20Exotic%20Swaps.md) deal wherein he agrees to pay Party B the return on his shares against LIBOR. $+25$ bps on a notional amt. If A is proven right, he will get money from B on account of the negative return on the stock as well as $\mathrm{LIBOR}+25\mathrm{b}$ ps on the notional. Hence, he mitigates the negative [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on the stock without losing on voting rights.. 2. It allows an investor to receive the return on a security which is listed in such a market where he cannot invest due to legal issues. For example, let's say A wants to invest in company $\boldsymbol{\mathrm X}$ listed in Country C. However, A is not allowed to invest in Country C due to capital control regulations. He can however, enter into a contract with B, who is a resident of C, and ask him to buy the shares of company $\boldsymbol{\mathrm X}$ and provide him with the return on share X and he agrees to pay him a fixed / floating rate of return.  

Equity Swaps, if effectively used, can make [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) barriers vanish and help an investor create [leverage](../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) similar to those seen in derivative products.  

[Investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) banks that offer this product usually take a riskless position by [hedging](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) the client's position with the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). For example, the client may trade a swap - say Vodafone. The bank credits the client with 1,000 Vodafone at GBP1.45. The bank pays the return on this [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) to the client, but also buys the stock in the same quantity for its own trading book (1,000 Vodafone at GBP1.45). Any equity-leg return paid to or due from the client is offset against realised profit or loss on its own [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in the [underlying asset](../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). The bank makes its money through commissions, interest spreads and dividend rake-off (paying the client less of the dividend than it receives itself). It may also use the hedge position stock (1,o00 Vodafone in this example) as part of a funding transaction such as stock lending,repo or as collateral for a loan.  

# Property derivatives  

A property derivative is a financial derivative whose value is derived from the value of an underlying real estate asset. In practice, because real estate assets fall victim to market inefficiencies and are hard to accurately price, property derivative contracts are typically written based on a real estate property index. In turn, the real estate property index attempts to aggregate real estate market information to provide a more accurate representation of. underlying real estate asset performance. Trading or taking positions in property [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) is also known as synthetic real estate.  

Property [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) usually take the form of a total return swap, [forward contract](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md), [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), or can adopt a funded format where the property derivative is embedded into a bond or note structure. Under the total return swap or [forward contract](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) the parties will usually take contrary positions on the price movements of a property index.  

The most common benchmarks used for writing property derivative contracts in the UK are the various property indices published by the [Investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) Property Databank 1] and FTSE UK Commercial Property Index Series [2l. The IPD Annual Index covers approximately 12,000 directly held UK property investments, market revalued in. December 2006 at just over 192 billion equivalent to $49\%$ of the UK [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) market. IPD indices are also used in a number of other countries such as Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Switzerland as the basis for commercial property [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md). In the United States commercial property utilizes the National Council of Real Estate [Investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) Fiduciaries (NCREIF) property index the NPI. There are two main residential real estate indices in the United States which trade - Radar Logic's RPX, and the main index - S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices (see Case-Shiller index).  

The FTSE UK Commercial Property Index Series currently covers 16bn of prime investible property assets directly held in the UK. The FTSE UK Commercial Property Index Series is valued daily, on a $\mathrm{T}{+2}$ basis.  

# Uses of Property Derivatives  

Property [Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) provide the investor with the ability to:  

.Gain or reduce exposure to the property market.   
:Hedge a current position in the physical assets.   
.Quickly change the composition of a [portfolio](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), i.e. switch out of Retail property and into Industrial. :To speculate on the property market  

All of these objectives can be achieved without having to transact in physical property; synthetic real estate.  

# Defining Property Market Performance  

To create a derivative there needs to be a point of reference for the performance of the market against which the derivative contracts are priced.  

In the case of property [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), this reference is provided by the [Investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) Property Databank and the FTSE index in the United Kingdom, and NCREIF, S&P/Case-Shiller and Rexx in the United States.  

The IPD Index and the FTSE UK Commercial Property Index Series provide a number of indices which relate to. performance of commercial property. There are many indices reflecting sectors and sub-sectors of the commercial property market. To date, much of the interest in property [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) relates to the UK market and its sub-sectors..  

# Types of Property Derivative  

There are 3 main types of Property Derivative in use in the UK property market today: Property Index Notes(PINs), Total Return Swap (TRS), and [Forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) which incorporates the IPD Property Index [Futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) listed on Eurex.  

In the United States property derivative trading is primarily through [forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) and future contracts. [Forwards](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) agreements are made generally on the RPX and NCREIF indices. [Futures trading](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Mechanics.md) is done by the CME Group via Globex utilizing the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices.  

# Property Index Notes  

The PINs are essentially bonds. The cash flows of these bonds are structured in a way that is meant to be similar to a transaction in the physical property. This means that the PIN pays the capital return on redemption of the bond and it pays a quarterly coupon to investors.  

In this way, the seller of the PIN pays the IPD annual or FTSE UK Commercial Property capital growth at. redemption and the income return, paid quarterly (IPD) or monthly (FTSE), to the counter party. This means that the counter party is, therefore, receiving the total return of the UK commercial property market, just as they would with. a physical transaction in property.  

# Total Return Swaps  

A property total return swap is simply an exchange of cash flows. Here, the total return on property, as measured by the change in the relevant IPD or FTSE UK Commercial Property Index, is exchanged for the return on cash.  

The UK IPD [pricing](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) mechanism was simplified on 15 January 2007. Rather than quoting libor $+/-$ a spread, now it's. a fixed $\%$ . So take the Dec 08 contract for example if it has a mid of $-11.5\%$ . This means that if you buy' the swap, you pay $-11.5\%$ (so receive $11.5\%$ due to the -ve sign) to your counterparty and receive the performance of IPD. (Or pay it out if it's a negative number) No quarterly cashflows, simply one annual interest payment versus one annual property payment.  

# Forwards/Futures  

A property [forward contract](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) is based upon the property [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) in any annual period - the expected total return for. example is agreed at trade, and on maturity the difference between the realized total return and the traded price is exchanged. Forward agreements are over the counter requiring a counter party to be found. Risk of default of either party must be considered in the trade [3]  

The CME Group has been trading in real estate [futures](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) since mid 2006. All trading is done electronically through the exchange who is the default counter party in all trades [3] .

Freight [Derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), which includes Forward Freight Agreement (FFA), container freight [swap agreements](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%204%20-%20Swap%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Swaps.md) and. options based on these, are [financial instruments](../Financial%20Instruments/A%20Practical%20Guide%20for%20Actuaries%20and%20other%20Business%20Professionals..md) for trading in future levels of freight rates, for dry bulk carriers, tankers and containerships. These instruments are settled against various freight rate indices published by the Baltic Exchange (for Dry and most Wet contracts) & Platt's (Asian Wet contracts). FFAs are often traded over-the-counter (through broker members of the Forward Freight Agreement Brokers Association - FFABA - such as Clarkson's Securities, SSY - Simpson, Spence and Young, Braemar Seascope LTD, Ifchor, FIS - Freight Investor Services,. BGC Partners, GFI Group Inc, ACM Shipping Ltd, BRS, Tradition-Platou, ICAPHYDE and IMAREX); but screen-based trading is becoming more popular, through various screens. Trades can be given up for clearing by the broker to one of the clearing houses that support such trades. There are four clearing houses for freight: NOS Clearing, LCH.Clearnet, NYMEX (NY Mercantile Exchange) and Singapore Stock Exchange (Singapore). Freight. [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) are primarily used by shipowners and operators, oil companies, trading companies and grain houses as. tools for managing freight rate risk. Recently with [Commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) now standing at the forefront of international economics; the large financial trading houses, including banks and [hedge funds](Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) have entered the market..  

# Dry Freight or Dry-Bulk FFAs  

The Baltic Exchange, Baltic Dry Index which measures the cost for shipping goods like iron ore and grains, doubled over the past 12 months and has risen more than fourfold since 2006..  

The trading volume of dry freight [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), a market estimated to be worth about $\$200$ billion in 2007, grew as those needing ships attempted to contain their risks and [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) banks and [hedge funds](Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) looked to make profits from speculating on price movements. At the close of the 2007 financial year, the number of traded lots on dry FFAs doubled the derived physical product.

Typically, real rate swaps also. come under this bracket, such as asset swaps of [inflation-indexed](Chinese%20Financial%20System.md) bonds (government-issued [inflation-indexed](Chinese%20Financial%20System.md) bonds, such as the Treasury [Inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918â€“1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) Protected Securities, UK [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918â€“1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-linked gilt-edged securities (ILGs), French OATeis, Italian BTPeis, German Bundeis and Japanese JGBis are prominent examples). [Inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918â€“1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) swaps are the linear form of. these [derivatives](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md). They can take a similar form to fixed versus floating interest rate swaps (which are the derivative form for fixed rate bonds), but use a real rate coupon versus floating, but also pay a redemption pickup at maturity. (i.e., the derivative form of [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918â€“1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) indexed bonds).

One party pays the compounded fixed rate and the other the actual [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918â€“1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate for the term. [Inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918â€“1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) swaps can also be paid on a year-on-year basis (YOY) (like YYIIS for example) where the year-on-year rate of change of the price index is paid, typically yearly as in the case of most European YOY swaps, but also monthly for many swapped notes in the US market. Even though the coupons are paid monthly, the [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918â€“1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate used is still the year-on-year rate.  

Options on [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918â€“1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) including [interest rate caps](Derivatives/Part%20IX%20-%20Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Chapter%2038%20-%20T-Bond%20Option,%20Caps,%20Floors%20and%20Collar.md), [interest rate floors](Derivatives/Part%20IX%20-%20Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Chapter%2038%20-%20T-Bond%20Option,%20Caps,%20Floors%20and%20Collar.md) and straddles can also be traded. These are typically priced against YOY swaps, whilst the swaption is priced on the ZC curve.  

Asset swaps also exist where the coupon payment of the linker ([inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918â€“1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) bond) as well as the redemption pickup at maturity is exchanged for interest rate payments expressed as a premium or discount to LIBOR for the relevant bond coupon period, all dates are co-terminus. The redemption pickup is the above par redemption value in the case of par/par asset swaps, or the redemption above the proceeds notional in the case of the proceeds [asset swap](Derivatives/Part%20VIII%20-%20Swaps/Chapter%2037%20-%20Equity%20Swaps.md). The proceeds notional equals the dirty nominal price of the bond at the time of purchase and is used as the fixed notional on the LIBOR leg.  

Real rate swaps are the nominal interest [swap rate](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Teaching%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives.md) less the corresponding [inflation swap](../Financial%20Instruments/Pricing%20an%20Inflation%20Swap.md).
