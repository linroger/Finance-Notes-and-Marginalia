# Ito's Lemma

Ito's lemma is one of the most important results in stochastic calculus and is fundamental to the pricing of financial derivatives. It provides a method for finding the differential of a function of a stochastic process, which is essential for deriving the Black-Scholes-Merton equation and many other results in continuous-time finance.

## 11.1 INTRODUCTION TO ITO'S LEMMA

In deterministic calculus, if we have a function $f(x,t)$ where $x$ is a function of time $t$, we can use the chain rule to find:

$$
df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}dt
$$

However, when $x$ follows a stochastic process, this simple chain rule no longer applies. Ito's lemma provides the correct formula for this stochastic case.

## 11.2 STATEMENT OF ITO'S LEMMA

Let $X_t$ be an Ito process satisfying:

$$
dX_t = \mu(X_t,t)dt + \sigma(X_t,t)dW_t
$$

where $W_t$ is a Wiener process, $\mu(X_t,t)$ is the drift term, and $\sigma(X_t,t)$ is the diffusion term.

Then, for a twice continuously differentiable function $f(x,t)$, the process $Y_t = f(X_t,t)$ follows:

$$
dY_t = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mu\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\right)dt + \sigma\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dW_t
$$

The key difference from deterministic calculus is the additional term $\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}$, which arises from the quadratic variation of the Wiener process.

## 11.3 INTUITION BEHIND ITO'S LEMMA

The extra term in Ito's lemma comes from the fact that $(dW_t)^2 = dt$ in the limit, which is not zero as it would be in deterministic calculus. This can be understood through a Taylor expansion:

$$
df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}dt + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}(dx)^2 + \text{higher order terms}
$$

When $dx = \mu dt + \sigma dW_t$, we have:
- $(dx)^2 = \sigma^2(dW_t)^2 + \text{terms of order } dt^{3/2} \text{ or higher}$
- $(dW_t)^2 = dt$ (in the limit)

Therefore, the $(dx)^2$ term contributes $\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}dt$ to the differential.

## 11.4 SIMPLE EXAMPLE: GEOMETRIC BROWNIAN MOTION

Consider a stock price $S_t$ following geometric Brownian motion:

$$
dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t
$$

To find the differential of $\ln(S_t)$, we apply Ito's lemma with $f(S_t,t) = \ln(S_t)$:

- $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = 0$
- $\frac{\partial f}{\partial S} = \frac{1}{S}$
- $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial S^2} = -\frac{1}{S^2}$

Therefore:

$$
d\ln(S_t) = \left(0 + \mu S_t \cdot \frac{1}{S_t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S_t^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{S_t^2}\right)\right)dt + \sigma S_t \cdot \frac{1}{S_t} dW_t
$$

$$
d\ln(S_t) = \left(\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\right)dt + \sigma dW_t
$$

This result shows that the log of a geometric Brownian motion follows a normal distribution, which is why the stock price itself has a lognormal distribution.

## 11.5 ITO'S LEMMA FOR MULTIPLE VARIABLES

For a function $f(X_1,X_2,...,X_n,t)$ where each $X_i$ follows an Ito process:

$$
dX_i = \mu_i dt + \sigma_i dW_i
$$

Ito's lemma becomes:

$$
df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}dt + \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\partial f}{\partial X_i}dX_i + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial X_i \partial X_j}dX_i dX_j
$$

where $dX_i dX_j = \sigma_i \sigma_j \rho_{ij} dt$ and $\rho_{ij}$ is the correlation between $dW_i$ and $dW_j$.

## 11.6 APPLICATION TO OPTION PRICING

Ito's lemma is fundamental to deriving the Black-Scholes-Merton partial differential equation. For a derivative $V(S,t)$ where the underlying asset $S$ follows geometric Brownian motion:

$$
dS = \mu S dt + \sigma S dW
$$

Applying Ito's lemma to $V(S,t)$:

$$
dV = \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \mu S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2}\right)dt + \sigma S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S}dW
$$

This differential is the starting point for deriving the Black-Scholes-Merton equation through the construction of a risk-free portfolio.

## 11.7 PRACTICE PROBLEMS

1. Apply Ito's lemma to find $d(S_t^2)$ when $S_t$ follows geometric Brownian motion.

2. If $X_t = W_t^2$ where $W_t$ is a Wiener process, find $dX_t$ using Ito's lemma.

3. For a bond price $B_t = e^{rt}$, and stock price $S_t$ following geometric Brownian motion, find $d(S_t/B_t)$.

## 11.8 CONCLUSION

Ito's lemma is the cornerstone of stochastic calculus in finance. It provides the mathematical framework for:
- Deriving the dynamics of transformed stochastic processes
- Developing the Black-Scholes-Merton model
- Pricing complex derivatives
- Understanding the relationship between different financial variables

The key insight is that stochastic processes have quadratic variation that contributes an additional term to the differential, fundamentally changing how we approach calculus in a random environment.
