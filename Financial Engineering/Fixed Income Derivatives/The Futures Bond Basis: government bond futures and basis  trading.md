# The Futures Bond Basis: government bond futures and basis  trading  

# ABSTRACT  

Government bond [[Mathematics of the Financial Markets|futures contracts]], traded on an exchange and representing a very  liquid product, are a key component of the global bond markets. The nominal value of  bonds represented by daily trading in the [[Contango And Backwardation In Arbitrage-Free Futures-Markets|futures markets]] far exceeds the actual nominal  value of the cash bond market itself. The difference between the price of a cash bond  and its implied price as given by a [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] contract, is the  basis . The basis has a  significant impact on the use of bond [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] for both [[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|hedging]] and speculative purposes.  Given its importance, it is vital that market participants have a clear understanding both  of the basis itself as well as its dynamics.  

The objective of this serial is ation, in three chapters, is to describe and explain the basis  in non-technical terms. We do this by taking examples from the United Kingdom gilt  market, although the basic principles will be applicable in any bond [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] market. As  such, we consider:  

   the [[Mathematics of the Financial Markets|futures contracts]] themselves, including contract specifications and the concept of  the [[Tba and Specified Pools Markets|cheapest-to-deliver]];  

   price and delivery data for a sample of gilt contracts;  

   the drivers of the basis and its dynamics;  

   the mechanics of basis trading;  

   a detailed explanation of [[Gross and Net Basis and Basis Trades|gross and net basis]], and the [[The Futures Bond Basis: government bond futures and basis  trading|implied repo rate]].
