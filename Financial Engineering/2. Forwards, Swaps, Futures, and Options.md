# Forwards, Swaps, Futures, and Options
These notes introduce forwards, swaps, futures and options as well as the basic mechanics of their associated markets. We will also see how to price forwards and swaps, but we will defer the pricing of futures contracts until after we have studied martingale pricing. We will see how to price options within the binomial model framework.

With the exception of the binomial model in Section 4, the underlying probability structure of the financial market plays only a small role in these notes. Nonetheless, you should not be under the impression that the results we derive only hold for deterministic models and are therefore limited in scope. On the contrary, many of the results we derive are very general and hold irrespective of the underlying probability structure that we might find ourselves working with.

Finally, we mention that it is easy to compute the value of a deterministic cash flow given the current term-structure of interest rates and we will often make use of this observation when pricing forwards and swaps.

Pricing securities with *stochastic* cash-flows is more complicated and requires more sophisticated no-arbitrage or equilibrium methods. The binomial model of Section 4, however, provides a simple yet important model for introducing some of these methods. We will study them in more generality and much greater detail when we study martingale pricing later in the course.

## 1 Forward Contracts
**Definition 1**: *A forward contract on a security (or commodity) is a contract agreed upon $\$a_t$$ date* $t = 0$ *to purchase or sell the security $$a_t$$ date* $T$ *for a price*, $F$, *that is specified $$a_t$$* $t = 0$.

When the forward contract is established $\$a_t$$ date $t = 0$, the forward price, $F$, is set in such a way that the initial value of the forward contract, $f_0$, satisfies $f_0 = 0$. At the maturity date, $T$, the value of the contract is given by $f_T = \pm(S_T - F)$ where $S_T$ is the time $T$ value of the underlying security (or commodity).

It is very important to realize that there are two "prices" or "values" associated with a forward contract $\$a_t$$ time $t$: $f_t$ and $F$. When we use the term "contract value" or "forward value" we will always be referring to $f_t$, whereas when we use the term "contract price" or "forward price" we will always be referring to $F$. That said, there should never be any ambiguity since $f_t$ is fixed (equal to zero) $$a_t$$ $t = 0$, and $F$ is fixed for all $t > 0$ so the particular quantity in question should be clear from the context. Note that $f_t$ need not be (and generally is not) equal to zero for $t > 0$.

**Example 1**: *Some examples of forward contracts are:*
- *A forward contract for delivery (i.e. purchase) of a non-dividend paying stock with maturity 6 months.*
- *A forward contract for delivery of a 9-month T-Bill with maturity 3 months. (This means that upon delivery, the T-Bill has 9 months to maturity.)*
- *A forward contract for the sale of gold with maturity 1 year.*
- *A forward contract for delivery of 10m Euro (in exchange for dollars) with maturity 6 months.*
### 1.1 Forward Prices
We first consider forward contracts on securities that can be *stored* $\$a_t$$ zero cost. The origin of the term "stored" is that of forward contracts on commodities such as gold or oil which typically are costly to store. However, we will also use the term when referring to financial securities. For example, while non-dividend paying stocks and zero-coupon bonds may be stored $$a_t$$ zero cost, it is also the case that dividend paying stocks and coupon paying bonds can be stored $$a_t$$ a *negative* cost.

**Theorem 1**: *Suppose a security can be stored $\$a_t$$ zero cost and that short-selling is allowed. Then the forward price*, $F$, *$$a_t$$* $t = 0$ *for delivery of that security $$a_t$$ date* $T$ *is given by*

$\$F = S/d(0, T) \tag{1}$$

*where* $S$ *is the current spot price of the security and* $d(0, T)$ *is the discount factor applying to the interval* $[0, T]$.

**Proof**: The proof works by constructing an arbitrage portfolio if $F \neq S/d(0, T)$.

**Case (i)**: $F < S/d(0, T)$: Consider the portfolio that $\$a_t$$ date $t = 0$ is short one unit of the security, lends $S$ until date $T$, and is long one forward contract. The initial cost of this portfolio is 0 and it has a positive payoff, $S/d(0, T) - F$, $$a_t$$ date $T$. Hence it is an arbitrage.

**Case (ii)**: $F > S/d(0, T)$: In this case, construct the reverse portfolio and again obtain an arbitrage opportunity.

**Example 2**: *(A Forward on a Non-Dividend Paying Stock)*
*Consider a forward contract on a non-dividend paying stock that matures in 6 months. The current stock price is $50 and the 6-month interest rate is 4\% per annum. Compute the forward price*, $F$.

**Solution**: Assuming semi-annual compounding, the discount factor is given by $d(0, 0.5) = 1/1.02 = 0.9804$. Therefore, $F = 50/0.9804 = \$51.00$.

### 1.2 The Value of a Forward Contract
We have seen how to calculate the forward price, $F$. We now calculate the value of a forward contract after it has been initiated.

**Theorem 2**: *The value $\$a_t$$ time* $t$ *of a forward contract (for delivery of a zero storage cost security) that was agreed upon $$a_t$$ time* $s < t$ *is given by*

$\$f_t = \pm \left[ S - F \cdot d(t, T) \right] \tag{2}$$

*where the $\pm$ sign is positive for long positions and negative for short positions.*

**Proof**: Again the proof works by construction of arbitrage portfolios.

### 1.3 Forward Contracts on Securities with Payouts
We must now specify the value of forward contracts when the underlying security pays dividends or coupons during the life of the contract. We use the following definition:

**Definition 2**: *The present (that is $\$a_t$$ time* $t$) *value of payouts of a security is the current value of all dividends, coupons etc. that will be paid by the security between time* $t$ *and the maturity time* $T$ *of the forward. We denote this value by* $D(t, T)$.

We can now state the pricing formula for forwards on securities that make payouts.

**Theorem 3**: *If a security makes payouts with present value* $D(0, T)$ *then the forward price $\$a_t$$ time* $t = 0$ *for delivery $$a_t$$ time* $T$ *is given by*

$\$F = \frac{S - D(0, T)}{d(0, T)} \tag{3}$$

**Proof**: Again construct arbitrage portfolios to establish the result.

**Example 3**: *(A Forward on a Stock with Discrete Dividends)*
*Consider a forward contract on a stock that matures in 9 months. The current stock price is $50 and the stock pays a dividend of $1.50 in 3 months and another dividend of $1.50 in 6 months. The 9-month interest rate is 6\% per annum with quarterly compounding. Compute the forward price*, $F$.

**Solution**: First compute the present value of dividends:
$\$D(0, 0.75) = 1.50 \times d(0, 0.25) + 1.50 \times d(0, 0.5)$$

where $d(0, 0.25) = 1/1.015 = 0.9852$ and $d(0, 0.5) = 1/(1.015)[^2] = 0.9707$.

Therefore, $D(0, 0.75) = 1.50 \times 0.9852 + 1.50 \times 0.9707 = 2.934$.

The discount factor for 9 months is $d(0, 0.75) = 1/(1.015)[^3] = 0.9563$.

Therefore, $F = (50 - 2.934)/0.9563 = \$49.22$.

## 2 Futures Contracts
Futures contracts are very similar to forward contracts in that they are agreements to buy or sell a security $\$a_t$$ a predetermined price and date. The crucial difference is that futures contracts are traded on exchanges and their gains and losses are *marked to market* on a daily basis. This daily settlement procedure eliminates much of the credit risk associated with forward contracts.

**Definition 3**: *A futures contract is an exchange-traded agreement to buy or sell a standardized quantity of a commodity or financial instrument $\$a_t$$ a predetermined price $$a_t$$ a future date.*

Key differences between forwards and futures:
1. **Standardization**: Futures are standardized contracts traded on exchanges
2. **Marking to market**: Daily settlement of gains and losses
3. **Margin requirements**: Initial and maintenance margins required
4. **Credit risk**: Virtually eliminated through the clearinghouse
5. **Liquidity**: Generally more liquid than forwards
### 2.1 Marking to Market
The marking to market process works as follows:
1. At the end of each trading day, the exchange determines the settlement price
2. All positions are marked to this price
3. Gains are credited and losses are debited from margin accounts
4. If margin falls below maintenance level, a margin call is issued
**Example 4**: *(Marking to Market)*
*Suppose you are long one gold futures contract with contract size 100 ounces. The futures price when you entered was $1,800/oz. The settlement prices for the next three days are $1,820, $1,790, and $1,815. Calculate the daily cash flows.*

**Solution**:
- Day 1: $(1,820 - 1,800) \times 100 = +\$2,000$
- Day 2: $(1,790 - 1,820) \times 100 = -\$3,000$
- Day 3: $(1,815 - 1,790) \times 100 = +\$2,500$
- Total: $+\$1,500$
### 2.2 The Relationship Between Futures and Forward Prices
In general, forward and futures prices need not be equal. However, when interest rates are deterministic, we can show that:

**Theorem 4**: *When interest rates are deterministic, futures prices equal forward prices.*

When interest rates are stochastic, the relationship becomes more complex and depends on the correlation between interest rates and the underlying asset price.

## 3 Swaps
A swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange cash flows in the future according to a predetermined formula. The most common types are interest rate swaps and currency swaps.

### 3.1 Interest Rate Swaps
**Definition 4**: *A plain vanilla interest rate swap is an agreement where one party pays a fixed interest rate and receives a floating interest rate on a notional principal amount.*

The party paying fixed is said to be "long" the swap or the "fixed rate payer." The party paying floating is "short" the swap or the "floating rate payer."

**Example 5**: *(Interest Rate Swap)*
*Consider a 2-year swap with semi-annual payments. The notional principal is $10 million, the fixed rate is 3% per annum, and the floating rate is 6-month LIBOR. Describe the cash flows.*

**Solution**:
Every 6 months:
- Fixed payer pays: $10,000,000 \times 0.03/2 = \$150,000$
- Floating payer pays: $10,000,000 \times LIBOR/2$
- Net payment: One party pays the difference
### 3.2 Swap Valuation
The value of a swap can be calculated as the difference between the values of two bonds:

**Theorem 5**: *The value of a plain vanilla interest rate swap is*

$\$V_{swap} = B_{fixed} - B_{float} \tag{4}$$

*where* $B_{fixed}$ *is the value of a fixed-rate bond and* $B_{float}$ *is the value of a floating-rate bond.*

At inception, swaps are structured so that their value is zero. This determines the fixed rate in the swap.

### 3.3 Currency Swaps
**Definition 5**: *A currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows in different currencies.*

Types of currency swaps:
1. Fixed-for-fixed: Fixed rate in one currency for fixed rate in another
2. Fixed-for-floating: Fixed rate in one currency for floating rate in another
3. Floating-for-floating: Floating rate in one currency for floating rate in another
## 4 Options
Options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset $\$a_t$$ a predetermined price.

### 4.1 Basic Definitions
**Definition 6**: *A European call option gives the holder the right to buy an asset $\$a_t$$ the strike price* $K$ *$$a_t$$ maturity* $T$. *A European put option gives the right to sell.*

**Definition 7**: *American options can be exercised $\$a_t$$ any time up to maturity.*

Payoffs $\$a_t$$ maturity:
- Call: $\max(S_T - K, 0)$
- Put: $\max(K - S_T, 0)$
### 4.2 Put-Call Parity
**Theorem 6**: *(European Put-Call Parity)*
*For European options on a non-dividend paying stock:*

$\$C - P = S - K \cdot d(0, T) \tag{5}$$

*where* $C$ *is the call price,* $P$ *is the put price,* $S$ *is the stock price, and* $K$ *is the strike price.*

**Proof**: Consider two portfolios:
1. Portfolio A: Long call + $K$ bonds
2. Portfolio B: Long stock + Long put
Both portfolios have the same payoff $\$a_t$$ maturity, so they must have the same value today.

### 4.3 Option Bounds
Several bounds can be established for option prices:

**For European calls on non-dividend paying stocks:**
$\$\max(S - K \cdot d(0, T), 0) \leq C \leq S$$

**For European puts on non-dividend paying stocks:**
$\$\max(K \cdot d(0, T) - S, 0) \leq P \leq K \cdot d(0, T)$$

### 4.4 Early Exercise of American Options
**Theorem 7**: *It is never optimal to exercise an American call option on a non-dividend paying stock before maturity.*

**Theorem 8**: *It may be optimal to exercise an American put option early.*

## 5 The Binomial Option Pricing Model
The binomial model provides a simple yet powerful framework for pricing options.

### 5.1 One-Period Model
Consider a stock with current price $S$. In one period, it can go to $S_u$ (up) or $S_d$ (down).

**Key insight**: We can replicate the option payoff using a portfolio of stock and bonds.

**Replication portfolio**:
- $\\Delta$ shares of stock
- $B$ bonds
Solving for $\\Delta$ and $B$:
$\$\\Delta = \frac{C_u - C_d}{S_u - S_d}$$
$\$B = \frac{C_d \cdot S_u - C_u \cdot S_d}{(S_u - S_d) \cdot (1 + r)}$$

### 5.2 Risk-Neutral Valuation
Define the risk-neutral probability:
$\$p = \frac{(1 + r) - d}{u - d}$$

Then the option price is:
$\$C = \frac{p \cdot C_u + (1 - p) \cdot C_d}{1 + r} \tag{6}$$

### 5.3 Multi-Period Model
The multi-period model extends this idea:
1. Work backwards from maturity
2. At each node, calculate the option value using the risk-neutral formula
3. Continue until reaching the initial node
**Example 6**: *(Two-Period Binomial Model)*
*Consider a stock with* $S = 100$, $u = 1.2$, $d = 0.9$, $r = 0.05$. *Price a European call with* $K = 100$ *and* $T = 2$ *periods.*

**Solution**:
1. Calculate stock prices $\$a_t$$ each node
2. Calculate option payoffs $\$a_t$$ maturity
3. Work backwards using risk-neutral valuation
4. The call price is approximately $13.07$
