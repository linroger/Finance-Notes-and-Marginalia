Pursuant to section 13(3)(C) of the Federal Reserve Act,  the Board must provide the Committee on [[HKS The Banking Industry|Banking]],  Housing,  and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on [[HBR Case Study- Oaktree|Financial Services]] of the House of Representatives (the Committees) an initial report regarding each facility established under section 13(3) and periodic updates at least every 30 days thereafter. This report provides the first periodic update for (1) the [[Update On Outstanding Lending Facilities|Primary Dealer Credit Facility]]

In addition to the PDCF,  CPFF,  and MMLF,  the Board also has authorized the establishment of the following credit facilities under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act: the Term [[Asset Backed Commercial Paper Understanding the Risks|Asset-Backed]] Securities Loan Facility,  the [[Primary Issuance and Secondary Resale Markets|Secondary Market]] Corporate [[Oaktree and the Restructuring of Cit Group (b)|Credit Facility]],  the [[Primary Issuance and Secondary Resale Markets|Primary Market]] Corporate [[Oaktree and the Restructuring of Cit Group (b)|Credit Facility]],  the Municipal [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|Liquidity]] Facility,  the Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility,  the Main Street New Loan Facility,  and the Main Street Expanded Loan Facility.

## A. **Primary Dealer Credit Facility**

On March 17,  2020,  the Board authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) to establish and operate the PDCF. The PDCF is a term loan facility that provides funding to primary dealers in exchange for a broad range of collateral and is intended to foster the functioning of [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial markets]] more generally. The facility allows primary dealers to support smooth market functioning and facilitate the availability of credit to businesses and households. Additional information concerning the PDCF can be found in the report provided to the Committees on March 24,  2020,  and on the Board's public website.

 1 This report includes the information that is required to be submitted to Congress in periodic reports under section 13(3)(C)(ii) of the Federal Reserve Act regarding the PDCF,  CPFF,  and MMLF. In addition,  the original version of the report regarding the CPFF submitted to the Committees on April 23,  2020,  described the aggregate collateral value under the facility as being reported on a "fair value" basis. The report should instead have described the amount reported as the "total value" of collateral. In particular,  consistent with [[Financial Accounting- Class Notes|Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]],  some collateral under the CPFF,  including [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]],  was valued at amortized cost. This updated report,  posted to the Board's website on June 10,  2020,  corrects this error.

Update. As of April 14,  2020:

- The total outstanding amount of the FRBNY's loans under the PDCF was $34,  549,  206,  000.
- The fair value of the collateral pledged to the FRBNY was $38,  454,  780,  697.
- The amount of interest,  fees,  and other revenue or items of value received by the FRBNY,  reported on an accrual basis,  was $5,  123,  056.
- As described in the Board's initial report to Congress regarding the PDCF,  the PDCF includes features that are intended to mitigate risk to the Federal Reserve. The Board continues to expect that the PDCF will not result in losses to the Federal Reserve.

## B. **[[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] Funding Facility**

On March 17,  2020,  the Board authorized the FRBNY to establish and operate the CPFF.

The CPFF provides a [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] backstop to U.S. issuers of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]],  including municipalities,  by purchasing three-month unsecured and [[Asset Backed Commercial Paper Understanding the Risks|asset-backed]] [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] directly from eligible issuers.

## C. **Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility**

On March 18,  2020,  the Board authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (FRBB) to establish and operate the MMLF. The MMLF provides funding to U.S. depository institutions and bank holding companies to finance their purchases of certain types of assets from money market mutual funds under certain conditions. The program is intended to assist money market mutual funds that hold such paper in meeting demands for redemptions by investors and to foster [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] in the markets for the assets held by money market mutual funds,  including the market for short-term [[US Markets|municipal securities]].
