# Periodic Report: **Update On Outstanding Lending Facilities** Authorized By The Board Under Section 13(3) Of The Federal Reserve Act April 23,  2020

## Overview

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is providing the following updates concerning certain lending facilities established by the Board under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. § 343). Pursuant to section 13(3)(C) of the Federal Reserve Act,  the Board must provide the Committee on Banking,  Housing,  and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives (the Committees) an initial report regarding each facility established under section 13(3) and periodic updates at least every 30 days thereafter. This report provides the first periodic update for (1) the Primary Dealer Credit Facility
(PDCF),  (2) the [](../Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper | Commercial%20Paper) Funding Facility (CPFF),  and (3) the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF).

In addition to the PDCF,  CPFF,  and MMLF,  the Board also has authorized the establishment of the following credit facilities under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act: the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility,  the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility.md),  the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility.md),  the Municipal Liquidity Facility,  the Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility,  the Main Street New Loan Facility,  and the Main Street Expanded Loan Facility. Periodic updates concerning these facilities will be provided at least every 30 days,  in accordance with section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act

## A. **Primary Dealer Credit Facility**

On March 17,  2020,  the Board authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) to establish and operate the PDCF. The PDCF is a term loan facility that provides funding to primary dealers in exchange for a broad range of collateral and is intended to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally. The facility allows primary dealers to support smooth market functioning and facilitate the availability of credit to businesses and households. Additional information concerning the PDCF can be found in the report provided to the Committees on March 24,  2020,  and on the Board's public website.

1 This report includes the information that is required to be submitted to Congress in periodic reports under section 13(3)(C)(ii) of the Federal Reserve Act regarding the PDCF,  CPFF,  and MMLF. In addition,  the original version of the report regarding the CPFF submitted to the Committees on April 23,  2020,  described the aggregate collateral value under the facility as being reported on a "fair value" basis. The report should instead have described the amount reported as the "total value" of collateral. In particular,  consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,  some collateral under the CPFF,  including [](../Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper | Commercial%20Paper),  was valued at amortized cost.
