## A. **Primary Dealer Credit Facility**

On March 17,  2020,  the Board authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) to establish and operate the PDCF. The PDCF is a term loan facility that provides funding to primary dealers in exchange for a broad range of collateral and is intended to foster the functioning of [financial markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) more generally. The facility allows primary dealers to support smooth market functioning and facilitate the availability of credit to businesses and households. Additional information concerning the PDCF can be found in the report provided to the Committees on March 24,  2020,  and on the Board's public website.

 1 This report includes the information that is required to be submitted to Congress in periodic reports under section 13(3)(C)(ii) of the Federal Reserve Act regarding the PDCF,  CPFF,  and MMLF. In addition,  the original version of the report regarding the CPFF submitted to the Committees on April 23,  2020,  described the aggregate collateral value under the facility as being reported on a "fair value" basis. The report should instead have described the amount reported as the "total value" of collateral. In particular,  consistent with [Generally Accepted Accounting Principles](../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Accounting-%20Class%20Notes.md),  some collateral under the CPFF,  including [](../Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper),  was valued at amortized cost. This updated report,  posted to the Board's website on June 10,  2020,  corrects this error.

Update. As of April 14,  2020:

- The total outstanding amount of the FRBNY's loans under the PDCF was $34,  549,  206,  000.
- The fair value of the collateral pledged to the FRBNY was $38,  454,  780,  697.
- The amount of interest,  fees,  and other revenue or items of value received by the FRBNY,  reported on an accrual basis,  was $5,  123,  056.
- As described in the Board's initial report to Congress regarding the PDCF,  the PDCF includes features that are intended to mitigate risk to the Federal Reserve. The Board continues to expect that the PDCF will not result in losses to the Federal Reserve.

## B. **[](../Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper) Funding Facility**

The CPFF provides a [liquidity](../Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) backstop to U.S. issuers of [](../Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper),  including municipalities,  by purchasing three-month unsecured and [asset-backed](../Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) [](../Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper) directly from eligible issuers.

On March 18,  2020,  the Board authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (FRBB) to establish and operate the MMLF. The MMLF provides funding to U.S. depository institutions and bank holding companies to finance their purchases of certain types of assets from money market mutual funds under certain conditions. The program is intended to assist money market mutual funds that hold such paper in meeting demands for redemptions by investors and to foster [liquidity](../Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) in the markets for the assets held by money market mutual funds,  including the market for short-term [municipal securities](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md).
