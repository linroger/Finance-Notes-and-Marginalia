# WSJ-Sizing Up the Fed’s Historic Coronavirus Crisis Intervention

The Federal Reserve has calmed crucial parts of the markets,  but other portions of the financial system remain stressed.

The central bank announced aggressive measures over the past month,  pledging to buy assets from Treasurys to corporate-bond funds to municipal debt. It has pumped liquidity into short-term cash markets. It has even arranged to lend directly to companies.

“The amount of measures taken in a short amount of time is surreal and unprecedented, ” said Jean Boivin,  head of the BlackRock Investment Institute.

For now,  according to traders,  market stresses triggered by the coronavirus pandemic have eased. But strains remain. Borrowing cash required for day-to-day operations,  for example,  still costs companies more than it should. Analysts said key details around certain Fed facilities remain unclear,  and some of its actions have yet to begin.
