# WSJ-Sizing Up the Fed’s Historic Coronavirus Crisis Intervention

The Federal Reserve has calmed crucial parts of the markets,  but other portions of the financial system remain stressed.

The central bank announced aggressive measures over the past month,  pledging to buy assets from Treasurys to corporate-bond funds to municipal debt. It has pumped liquidity into short-term cash markets. It has even arranged to lend directly to companies.

“The amount of measures taken in a short amount of time is surreal and unprecedented, ” said Jean Boivin,  head of the BlackRock Investment Institute.

For now,  according to traders,  market stresses triggered by the coronavirus pandemic have eased. But strains remain. Borrowing cash required for day-to-day operations,  for example,  still costs companies more than it should. Analysts said key details around certain Fed facilities remain unclear,  and some of its actions have yet to begin. And assets that haven’t been backed by the Fed,  including commercial mortgage-backed securities.md),  are still in distress.

Here are some of the key moves the Fed has announced,  what has happened to date and how markets have reacted:

Analysts in the bond market said that while the purchases were a good first step,  other assets,  including corporate debt,  needed support. The yield on the U.S. 10-year note fell to 0.724%,  compared with 0.97% in the previous trading session. Yields fall as bond prices rise.

**Market reaction:** The cost of borrowing short-term in repo markets didn’t fall immediately.

**Market targeted:** currencies

**Market reaction:** The effects took time to seep through the market. Demand for dollars against the euro declined,  while Japanese demand for the U.S. currency remained high until last week.

Use of the Fed’s central-bank swap lines jumped by $349 billion.

In the money markets,  bank commercial deposits and longer-dated [](../../Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper | Commercial%20Paper) have begun to trade again.

The Fed said it would buy investment-grade debt issued by companies such as Intel Corp. and PepsiCo Inc.,  along with exchange-traded funds of highly rated bonds. The Fed also said it would lend money directly to businesses,  bypassing banks with bridge loans of up to four years.

 !500
**Market targeted:** investment-grade Corporate Bonds

**Market reaction:** Goldman Sachs analysts and others said the actions helped to stabilize the corporate-bond market,  which came under significant stress. But investors and rating firms remain concerned that companies will default or be downgraded as dwindling revenue makes meeting financial obligations a struggle.

**Market targeted:** midsize companies

**Market reaction:** The Fed hasn’t announced any details of this program,  which involves making decisions on who receives loans for businesses other than banks,  something it hasn’t attempted on a wide scale since the Great Depression.

**Market targeted:**Treasurys,  agency mortgage-backed securities

**Market targeted:** currencies

**Market reaction:** Priya Misra,  head of interest-rate strategy at TD Securities,  said the facility should help foreign central banks get their hands on U.S. dollars without selling Treasurys. Foreign official accounts sold $110 billion of Treasurys held in custody at the New York Fed over the past month. “By lowering the extent of potential selling,  the Fed is reducing the pressure on Treasurys and dealer balance sheets, ” said Ms. Misra.
