# Turmoil in Financial Markets the Risk Business

- **Special Article: Turmoil In [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|Financial Markets]]: [[Turmoil in Financial Markets the Risk Business|The Risk Business]]**
	- Many people think that [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] are to blame for the turmoil in the world's [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial markets]].
	- The collapse of [[Turmoil in Financial Markets the Risk Business|Long-Term Capital Management]] is discussed.
- **Abstract**
	- [[Basis Trade Explainer|Hedge funds]],  those bold adventurers of the [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial markets]],  have lost pots of money as [[Turmoil in Financial Markets the Risk Business|markets have fallen sharply]].
	- They are also getting much of the blame for the very turmoil that brought them low.
	- [[Turmoil in Financial Markets the Risk Business|Long-Term Capital Management]] nearly went bust in September and was saved only when the Federal Reserve organized its rescue.
	- Other [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] are already paying the price for the fund's demise.
	- Tarring all [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] with the brush that has been used for [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]] is wrong.
	- [[Basis Trade Explainer|Hedge funds]],  in general,  are surprisingly different from one another.
	- Few [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] are as hugely leveraged as [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]].
	- The combination of apparently low-risk strategies with enormous [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products|leverage]] may be rare among [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]],  but it is by no means uncommon in other parts of the finance industry.
	- [[An Asset Allocation Primer|Investment]] banks routinely have [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products|leverage]] in excess of 20 to 1.
	- Banks' role in the present [[Deciphering the Liquidity and Credit Crunch 2007–2008|financial turmoil]] is crucial.
	- It is important to take a look at how banks manage their own financial risk.
- Many think that [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] are to blame for the turmoil in the world's [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial markets]].
	- They are not.
	- The planned opening session at a big hedge-fund gathering in Bermuda this week had been entitled: How to Handle the Flood of Assets Coming In.
	- A late substitution was announced: Crisis and Corrections: Implications for [[Basis Trade Explainer|Hedge Funds]].
	- How quickly the mood has swung in [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial markets]],  from carefree bullishness to deep pessimism.
	- [[Basis Trade Explainer|Hedge funds]],  those bold adventurers of the [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial markets]],  have lost pots of money as [[Turmoil in Financial Markets the Risk Business|markets have fallen sharply]],  which is bad enough.
	- Now,  to add insult to injury,  they are getting much of the blame for the very turmoil that brought them low.
	- They make good whipping boys.
	- It is convenient that they tend to be run by colourful and conspicuous types-men such as George Soros,  who (sometimes) runs the Quantum group of funds,  or Julian Robertson,  who runs Tiger,  the biggest hedge fund of all.
	- They shroud their operations in secrecy and are blamed for manipulating markets from Hong Kong to London.
	- Critics accuse them of being nothing more than rapacious speculators,  borrowing heavily to beef up their bets.
	- This enormous amount of footloose money,  it is argued,  can bend the [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial markets]] out of shape-and it has.
	- Mr. Robertson was in fact the star turn at the Bermuda conference (run by MAR/Hedge,  a newsletter).
	- Only days before he spoke,  via satellite link,  Tiger had lost nearly $2 billion,  more than a tenth of its assets,  in 24 hours.
	- The cause was the dollar's plunge against the yen; some [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] traders blamed Tiger for worsening that fall as it fled from the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].
	- [[Basis Trade Explainer|Hedge funds]] had also been blamed,  a day earlier,  when Treasury bond prices jumped unexpectedly sharply.
	- Any big swing in any market is now routinely attributed to this or that hedge fund getting in or out.
	- Market-makers' fears that they will find themselves on the wrong end of such trades has made them fearful of all trading.
- This has been partly responsible for the widening of [[Class Note 9 [[Class Note 9 Bid and Ask Prices With Private Information|Bid and Ask]] Prices With Private Information|[[Bid-Ask Prices with Adverse SelectionPrivate Information|bid-ask]] spreads]] (the difference between the price a trader is willing to pay for a security and the price at which he offers to sell it).
	- This,  in turn,  signals the drying up of [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] in many [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial markets]].
	- There is even a particular villain,  an exemplary specimen,  on which critics can focus: [[Turmoil in Financial Markets the Risk Business|Long-Term Capital Management]] ([[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]]).
	- Founded by,  among others,  two Nobel laureates in economics,  a former vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve,  and one of Wall Street's most successful bond-traders,  Long-Term Capital nearly went bust in September.
	- It was saved only when the Federal Reserve organised its rescue by many of the banks that had previously lent it billions of dollars.
	- According to Alan Greenspan,  [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]]'s chairman,  if the fund had failed it could have inflicted serious damage on many market participants,  and "could potentially have impaired the economies of many nations,  including our own."
	- Although its rescue has staved off the worst consequences,  rumours that [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]] is busy unwinding its huge positions continue to spook the markets.
	- Other [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] are already paying a price for the fund's demise.
	- Banks,  blamed for lending too generously to [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]] and its fellow [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] before,  are now being more miserly.
	- Some [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] have had credit lines cut; most are having to stump up far more collateral as security against loans.
	- Investors are starting to withdraw money and redemptions are expected to soar as the financial year ends.
	- Hardest hit,  ironically,  are the largish group of [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] that have performed well of late,  for the simple reason that they have the cash.
	- To cap it all,  there are now calls in Congress and elsewhere for the funds to be regulated.
- **Through a hedge backwards Hang on a moment.**
	- Tarring all [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] with the brush that has been used for [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]] is wrong.
	- The most striking thing about [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]] is not how similar it is to other [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]],  but how different.
	- Indeed [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] in general are surprisingly different,  one from another.
	- The first was formed in 1949 by Alfred Winslow Jones.
	- At the last count,  there were getting on for 3,  000 [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]],  managing around $200 billion of investors' money,  according to TAss,  a research firm.
	- Although there is no simple definition of a hedge fund,  they do have certain things in common.
	- They are structured as limited partnerships,  often offshore,  which means that they are largely unregulated.
	- They charge fat fees,  normally 20% of profits.
	- They are open only to the rich,  to whom they offer the prospect of making absolute [[Assets|returns]] rather than relative ones-that is,  they concentrate on making money,  not on outperforming an index.
- **Do [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] speculate wildly?**
	- Many see themselves not as speculators at all but as arbitrageurs.
	- That means they are looking for assets whose prices are temporarily out of line with their fundamental values,  selling those they deem expensive or buying any they think cheap.
	- By doing this,  in principle,  the [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] can help to make markets more efficient.
	- Given the huge losses run up by some [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]],  "[[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]]" might now look like a fancy word for reckless speculation.
	- Stephen Ross,  an economist at MIT,  argues that opportunities for [[Arbitrage Pure Versus Relative Value|pure arbitrage]]-defined as "no risk of losing money"-are very limited.
	- For instance,  if an investor could borrow at 4% and lend at 5% for the same length of time,  in each case dealing with institutions with the same [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]],  he would become very rich.
	- That is why such opportunities are rare.
	- Most of what [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] do is "[[FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE|expectations]] [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]]",  in which the chances of making a profit simply exceed the chances of making a loss.
	- Mr. Ross guesses that,  worldwide,  the total available profits to be made from both sorts of [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]]-the [[Assets|returns]] in excess of what one might expect,  given the risk-amount to less than $50 billion,  a tiny sum compared with the amounts sloshing around world [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial markets]].
	- Most so-called [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]] has an element of betting.
	- As Mr. Ross puts it,  "there is no hard line between [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]] and speculation; it is a continuum."
	- In other words,  many [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] do indeed speculate.
	- But there is nothing wrong in that.
	- Markets need speculators.
	- By taking one side of a trade that others do not want,  speculators improve [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]].
	- Indeed,  the current drying-up of [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] in many markets is in part a consequence of the credit squeeze being inflicted on [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] by banks.
- Yet whether speculating or arbitraging,  [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] do not,  or at least do not generally,  pursue the same strategies: they follow many different ones.
	- Some,  such as Tiger or Moore Capital,  bet on macroeconomic trends,  such as the direction of an exchange rate.
	- Others focus on particular sorts of events,  such as bankruptcies or mergers,  or merely play the [[Hedge Fund Strategies|stock market]].
	- Still others,  such as [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]],  go in for "market-neutral" [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]].
	- This aims to make money whatever happens to the direction of,  say,  [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] or the [[Hedge Fund Strategies|stock market]],  by buying assets that seem relatively cheap and simultaneously short-[[Week 6 Assignment Review|selling assets]] that seem overpriced.
	- Such funds account for around 10% of total hedge-fund assets.
	- Few [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] are as hugely leveraged as [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]].
	- By the time it was rescued,  [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]] had piled roughly $50 of borrowing on to every dollar of equity.
	- Earlier,  its [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products|leverage]] had been more like 20 to 1: but subsequent losses consumed much of its equity.
	- According to George Van,  of Van Hedge Fund Advisers,  a consultancy,  almost a third of

 [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] do not borrow at all.
	- A further 54% borrow no more than the amount of equity their investors put into them.
	- Among the rest,  it is extremely rare to see [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products|leverage]] greater than ten to one.
	- [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]] was probably unique.
- **Why is [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products|leverage]] on [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]]'s scale so rare?**
	- If a bet is a risky one,  it will make a lot of money anyway.
	- When the bet is relatively safe,  the profit to be made from it will be meagre-unless you bet big.
	- That is why the large macro [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]],  such as Quantum or Tiger,  will [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products|leverage]] more in bonds,  say,  than in currencies,  which are far more volatile.
	- Few if any [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] would be so foolish as to [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products|leverage]] their bets on the likes of the Russian bond market.
- **Market-neutral strategies,  Long-Term Capital's chosen field,  were supposed to be the safest of the lot.**
	- One of the fund's main strategies was to exploit tiny differences between the price of a newly issued ("on the run") 30-year American Treasury bond,  and a similar one issued previously ("off the run").
	- There is little economic reason for these bonds to have different yields.
	- Yet off-the-run Treasuries often trade slightly cheaper than on-the-run ones.
	- [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]] bet that their yields would converge by buying off-the-run Treasuries and selling their on-the-run counterparts short.
	- The potential profits were tiny-no more than a few basis points (hundredths of a percentage point).
	- So the fund multiplied its bets by borrowing.
	- [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]] sources say that such positions were leveraged some 30 to 40 times.
	- In contrast,  [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]] had much lower [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products|leverage]] on its bet that yields on Danish [[Fremont Financial Corp. (b)|mortgage-backed securities]] would converge with those on American Treasuries-a far riskier speculation.
	- The fund aimed to be about as risky as the American [[Hedge Fund Strategies|stock market]] as a whole.
	- This ambition meant that it was far more leveraged than other market-neutral [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]],  which typically aim for lower volatility than shares.
	- According to Mr. Van,  other market-neutral [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] earned an average of 14% a year over the past five years,  compared with [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]]'s more stratospheric average of 40% a year in 1994-97.
	- That is one reason to believe that other [[Portable Alpha and Market-Neutral Plays|market-neutral funds]] will not find themselves in the same straits as [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]].
- **A hedge by any other name**
	- The combination of apparently low-risk strategies with enormous [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products|leverage]] may be rare among [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]],  but it is by no means uncommon in other parts of the finance industry.
	- In fact,  says Bob Schulman of Tremont Advisors,  a consultancy,  that is just what the trading arms of banks do.
	- [[An Asset Allocation Primer|Investment]] banks routinely have [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products|leverage]] in excess of 20 to 1.
	- Like [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]],  they make much greater use of [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] to [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products|leverage]] their bets than do most [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]].
	- (They also make more extensive use of the sort of financial rocket-science for which two of [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]]'s founders won the Nobel prize.)
	- Mr. Ross reckons that banks punt the same amount of capital in this way as all [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] put together.
	- Banks' role in the present [[Deciphering the Liquidity and Credit Crunch 2007–2008|financial turmoil]] is crucial.
	- After [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]] was rescued,  many [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] banks were quick to reveal details of their exposure to [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]] in particular,  and in some cases to [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] in general.
	- This exposure was mostly quite trifling compared with banks' total assets or capital.
	- But these admissions were beside the point.
	- Many banks have followed similar strategies to Long-Term Capital-but,  in aggregate,  on a bigger scale.
	- According to some reports,  whereas [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]] had an exposure of $80 billion to arbitrage between American Treasuries,   banks had $3 trillion tied up in similar bets.
	- It was for this reason that [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] felt it had no choice but to organise the rescue of [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]],  as Mr. Greenspan made clear in testimony to Congress.
	- Had the fund gone bust,  and its positions been liquidated in a firesale,  it would have made banks' bets even more loss-making than they already were.
	- Since these are revalued daily,  the banks could quickly have become technically insolvent.
	- Might that happen anyway?
	- Unlike [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]],  banks have several sources of income,  from normal [[HKS The Banking Industry|banking]] business in the case of commercial banks,  to [[Corporate Finance Lecture Notes|corporate finance]] business or stockbroking for [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] banks.
	- Moreover,  they have built up substantial capital in the bull markets of the past few years,  which gives them a cushion to fall back on.
	- Still,  nobody on Wall Street would be surprised if,  when normality [[Assets|returns]],  it emerges that at least one [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] bank was,  at some point,  on the brink of going under.
- **Mousetraps and models**
	- Why have banks done so badly?
	- After all,  recent years have seen many financial crises: the 1987 [[Hedge Fund Strategies|stock market]] crash; the breakup of Europe's exchange-rate mechanism in 1992-93; the bond market crash in February 1994; the Mexican crisis of 1995.
	- As a result,  banks have spent much time and money developing sophisticated [[Financial Mathematics Course|risk management]] models.
	- The most favoured,  used by [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]] and most banks is the "value-at-risk" (VAR) model.
	- This purports to give a bank an idea of the amount of money it is likely to lose over a certain period; if this goes up,  the bank can reduce its positions or put up extra capital.
	- Unfortunately,  there are some big flaws in the VAR approach.
	- The first is in that word "likely".
	- The models assume that markets are neat places where bad things,  such as [[Hedge Fund Strategies|stock market]] crashes,  rarely happen.
	- If you imagine a "normal probability bell curve",  extreme movements are represented by the thin tails on either side.
	- Unfortunately,  it seems that such outcomes happen more frequently than the models allow.
	- The tails,  in other words,  may be fatter,  something which statisticians have a suitably off-putting word for: leptokurtosis.
- A second problem arose because of the particular nature of the bets the banks were making.
	- Recall that these were often bets on the spreads between different assets,  such as different European government bonds,  or between bonds issued in emerging markets and American Treasuries-and the bet was that these spreads would narrow.
	- The past few months have seen a dramatic and unexpected widening of such spreads.
	- The banks' [[Credit Markets Session 4|risk models]] assumed that the spreads were relatively stable and predictable because they had been in the past.
	- Third,  the value-at-[[Credit Markets Session 4|risk models]] implicitly assumed that banks could always get out of their positions: they made no allowance for [[Asset Backed Commercial Paper Understanding the Risks|liquidity risk]].
	- Unfortunately,  the exit has been well and truly jammed as everybody scrambled to get out of the same positions at the same time.
	- Intermediaries,  mostly [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] banks,  became less willing to bid for assets.
	- With [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] reduced,  volatility tended to rise and prices to fall,  in turn forcing the banks to sell even more.
	- This vicious circle began in Asia a year or so ago,  when [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] crises there led to a sharp increase in emerging market bond yields.
	- Several studies have cleared [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] of blame for this.
	- One,  by Will Goetzmann,  Stephen Brown and James Park,  three American economists,  found that the weight of hedge-fund bets in a given week had no bearing on the direction that markets took during that period.
- The trouble spread to developed economies in April,  when [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] banks' bond-trading desks started to lose money for the first time since 1994,  in this case in [[Fremont Financial Corp. (b)|mortgage-backed securities]].
	- Bid-offer spreads in that market started to widen.
	- As the banks started to cut their other risky assets,  [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] was reduced in the market for high yield ("junk") [[Class Notes 2 – Corporate Bond Contracts|Corporate Bonds]].
	- Things became much worse in August,  after the Russian government devalued.
	- The Russian crisis added to the markets' problems in three ways.
		- First,  the de facto default increased the [[Risk Preferences|riskiness]] of emerging sovereign debt in the eyes of investors,  who had until then assumed that they would at worst be rescheduled and that the IMF would almost always bail out a government.
		- Since such assets had suddenly become riskier,  risk-management models advised selling some of them-leading to more falls in prices and a reduced appetite among buyers.
		- Second,  many investors lost their shirts in Russia,  and so needed to reduce risks in other markets to reflect their diminished equity.
		- Third,  some [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] banks refused to honour hedge contracts sold to investors,  arguing that the Russian government default was a case of force majeure,  freeing them from the obligation.
		- This too increased perceived risks.
- By this point,  the banks' risk-management models were shuddering ominously,  ordering risks to be reduced across the board,  and restraining traders from making bids-which served only to reduce [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] even further.
	- The news of [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]]'s troubles and its rescue was the last straw.
	- Banks assumed that other [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] held huge,  loss-making positions that might have to be unwound.
	- And not just [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]]: there were rumours aplenty that several [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] banks were on the verge of going bust.
	- The recent collapse in the dollar against the yen was probably due

 to forced liquidation of positions by both banks and [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] in which they had borrowed in yen and invested the proceeds in dollars.

- **Where now?**
	- Keen to restore their balance sheets,  [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] banks are unlikely to return to risk-taking with any enthusiasm soon.
	- Until the huge portfolios of [[Class Note 13 The [[Risk Management Lessons From Long Term Capital Management|LTCM Meltdown]]|LTCM]] and [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] banks are seen as desirable,  rather than as a potential cause of further price declines,  many markets are likely to remain paralysed.
	- This would,  ironically,  be a perfect opportunity for [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] to come to the rescue with a dose of contrarian speculation-sorry,  [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]]-if only they were not being beaten up by the very [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] banks they would help out of their difficulties.
	- That is one reason why the brouhaha about [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] is so misplaced.
	- Many are already shadows of their former selves.
	- Once bitten,  and with regulators breathing down their necks,  banks will continue to tighten lending to them.
	- For banks and their regulators alike,  it is more important to take a long,  hard look at how banks manage their own financial risks,  and at the rules for allocating capital against their loans.
	- But bear in mind that banks' losses to "dangerously" unregulated [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]] are in the tens of millions of dollars.
	- Their losses in emerging-market lending,  which is regulated,  run in the tens of billions.
