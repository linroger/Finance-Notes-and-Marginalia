# The Economist Margin Call of the Wild

Before friday March 26th,  few people may have heard of [Archegos](.md) Capital Management,  an [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) vehicle run by [Bill Hwang](.md),  a former hedge-fund trader with a chequered past. But it has emerged as the entity behind a fire sale of at least $20bn-worth of equities,  which roiled stockmarkets on an otherwise unremarkable Friday and has left at least two global banks—[Credit Suisse](.md) and [Nomura](.md)—facing multi-billion-dollar losses. Financial regulators in America and Europe will have a say before the affair has run its course.

The plotline has already taken shape. [Archegos](.md) is a so-called family office. It manages the private wealth of Mr Hwang,  who once worked for Tiger Management,  a celebrated hedge fund. One of [Archegos](.md)’s strategies was long-short equity. The main idea is to be indifferent to the direction of the overall market by betting that the share prices of some stocks will rise while the prices of other stocks fall. The hope is that the longs do better than the shorts. But when markets are volatile the strategy can come unstuck. This is what seems to have happened to [Archegos](.md). 

The first sign of trouble came that Friday when Goldman Sachs and [Morgan Stanley](Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md),  two Wall Street behemoths,  began selling large blocks of shares for an unnamed client who had missed a margin call—a demand for more collateral to cover losses on trades that had gone awry. The stocks that were forcibly sold might best be categorised as “second-tier tech”. They included [Baidu,     a Chinese search engine](https://archive.is/o/ij3xX/https://www.economist.com/business/2021/03/20/baidu-turns-to-personal-transport-for-growth),  and [Viacomcbs](https://archive.is/o/ij3xX/https://www.economist.com/business/2019/08/15/viacom-and-cbs-agree-to-reunite),  an American media conglomerate,  with a streaming service that gives it the flavour of a faddish tech stock. Their prices crashed under the weight of the selling. The price of Viacomcbs shares,  for instance,  fell by more than a quarter.

By Sunday March 28th it had emerged that the mystery client was [Archegos](.md). More familiar names were caught up in the drama. On Monday [Credit Suisse](.md) said it was in the process of liquidating the positions of a client that had defaulted on [margin calls](Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md),  and that the related losses would be “material”. Unofficial estimates put these at $3bn-4bn. Nomura,     a Japanese bank,     said that it was on the hook for about $2bn,  possibly more if stock prices fell further. These are significant losses. If not quite a lost limb,  they amount to more than a flesh wound. The banks’ share prices tanked. 

The full reckoning will only become clear over time. But evidently [Nomura](.md) and [Credit Suisse](.md) were slower to pull the plug than their American rivals,  after an attempt to coordinate an orderly unwinding of [Archegos](.md)’s positions failed. By making the margin call on [Archegos](.md) early,  and then liquidating positions quickly,  the Americans seem to have limited the damage to themselves,  but left the others nursing bigger mark-to-market losses. 

The fire sale raises some disquieting questions. How was Mr Hwang,  a little-known figure,  able to run up such big losses? [Leverage](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) played a big part. Why then was he able to lean so heavily on Wall Street to enhance the size of his bets? What makes this even more puzzling is that Mr Hwang had already blotted his copybook. In 2012 he pleaded guilty to charges of insider trading.

One answer is that banks are desperately searching for profits. Rules drafted after the [global financial crisis](../../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) make it expensive for Wall Street banks to trade on their own account. The days when they could make much money from slow-moving,  unleveraged asset managers—the “long-only” crowd—are a distant memory. Such investors mostly buy and sell stocks cheaply on electronic platforms. So Wall Street banks increasingly rely on fees and commissions from fast-trading [hedge funds](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) or family offices that act like [hedge funds](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md),  such as [Archegos](.md). Fees on bespoke [derivatives](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md),  such as equity swaps and contracts for difference,  are especially attractive to the brokerages. The appeal for the fast-money hedge-fund crowd is that such [derivatives](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) allow them to magnify their positions. They can make large bets without having to put up lots of their own capital upfront. 

In short,  Wall Street can’t easily make money out of people who do not take rash bets. But people who make rash bets can lose you money,  too. It is probably not a coincidence that [Credit Suisse](.md) and [Nomura](.md) are based in countries (Switzerland and Japan,  respectively) where [long-term interest rates](.md) have been stuck near or below zero. With few opportunities to make money from lending at home,  they turned to Wall Street for excitement. Unfortunately for their shareholders,  they found it. 

Parallels are naturally being drawn between [Archegos](.md) and [LTCM Meltdown](Class%20Note%2013%20The%20[[Risk%20Management%20Lessons%20From%20Long%20Term%20Capital%20Management)|LTCM]],  an ill-fated hedge fund. In 1998 [LTCM Meltdown](Class%20Note%2013%20The%20[[Risk%20Management%20Lessons%20From%20Long%20Term%20Capital%20Management)|LTCM]] was prevented from blowing up itself and the [banking system](../../II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Class%20Slide%203%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) by the Federal Reserve,  which co-ordinated a bail-out by its Wall Street brokers. [LTCM Meltdown](Class%20Note%2013%20The%20[[Risk%20Management%20Lessons%20From%20Long%20Term%20Capital%20Management)|LTCM]],  too,  was afforded breathtaking [leverage](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) by its brokers,  who were dazzled by its principal shareholders,  who included John Meriwether,  a star trader formerly at [Salomon Brothers](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Understanding%20The%20Yield%20Curve-%20Part%201.md),  and Robert [Merton](../../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%205.md) and Myron Scholes,  Nobel-prizewinning economists. It appears that several of the banks that acted as Mr Hwang’s brokers tried to come to a standstill agreement,  of the kind that [the Fed](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) mediated for [LTCM Meltdown](Class%20Note%2013%20The%20[[Risk%20Management%20Lessons%20From%20Long%20Term%20Capital%20Management)|LTCM]],  in order to avoid a fire sale of the stocks they held to hedge their exposure to [Archegos](.md). Those discussions are now the subject of regulatory scrutiny. The tentacles of [Archegos](.md) evidently do not stretch anything like as far into the [financial system](../../../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md) as [LTCM Meltdown](Class%20Note%2013%20The%20[[Risk%20Management%20Lessons%20From%20Long%20Term%20Capital%20Management)|LTCM]]’s. The wider damage from the [Archegos](.md) affair has so far been limited.

[Archegos](.md) might be a one-off mishap,  albeit a large one. But it is not too much of a stretch to link it to some recent market themes. Since November there has been a general shift away from tech-and-media stocks,  which profited greatly from the stay-at-home economy,  towards [Forecasting](Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20[[Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting))|cyclical]] companies,  such as banks,  airlines and industrial firms,  which benefit from reopening. [Archegos](.md) may well have been at the wrong end of this,  at times violent,  rotation. Events are moving unusually fast in the world economy and in [financial markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md). And when events move fast,  some things get broken.
