# Case Study of [Northern Rock](Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock.md)

Basel III: Proposals for a Better [Banking](../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Regime (The Wiley Finance Series)

Until demutualisation in 1997,  [Modern Bank Runs](Reflections%20On%20[[Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock) a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] was a staid UK building society. Once it had become a plc,  it transformed itself into an upstart in UK mortgage finance. The [Modern Bank Runs](Reflections%20On%20[[Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock) a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] business model was aggressive in several financial aspects and eventually failed spectacularly at an early stage in the [financial crisis](../Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md). Despite a fairly modest size,  [Modern Bank Runs](Reflections%20On%20[[Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock) a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] is an instructive case study in financial (in-)stability and risk (mis-)management and served as a reminder of the importance of [Liquidity](Class%20Note%2010%20[[Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management) and Class Note 10 [Liquidity](../Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) and [Liquidity](../Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) Managementliquidity management|[liquidity management](Class%20Slides%20Effects%20of%20MMF%20Regulations%20in%20the%20United%20States.md)]]. It also represents an indelible icon of the woes of the UK [banking system](../../II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Class%20Slide%203%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md),  due to the horrific TV and newspaper pictures of patient depositors queuing at its branches to pull their savings to safety - the first [bank run](../Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) in the UK since Overend Gurney in 1866 and the City of Glasgow Bank in 1878.

The creation of a [wholesale-funded model](.md),  [Modern Bank Runs](Reflections%20On%20[[Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock) a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] grew fivefold in the decade after demutualisation. Between 1997 and 2006,  customer loans grew from £13bn to £87bn and profit grew from £73m to £395m. During the same period,  however,  regulatory equity capital increased by a more modest amount,  from £0.7bn to £1.7bn,  yet the regulatory Tier 1 solvency ratio was roughly stable,  having gone from 8.7% to 8.5% In short,  [Modern Bank Runs](Reflections%20On%20[[Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock) a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] had grown its mortgage book far faster than its [regulatory capital requirements](.md),  by using [securitization](../../../Financial%20Engineering/10.%20Other%20Topics%20in%20Quantitative%20Finance.md) on more than half of its mortgage book.

This capital "efficiency" and a low-cost marketing model with very few branches enabled an attractive and cheap mortgage product to be offered to customers. By 2007,  [Modern Bank Runs](Reflections%20On%20[[Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock) a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] was writing one-fifth of all new UK mortgages and remortgages and growing at 40% per year. Securitisation is a valid tool for financing rock-solid loan books efficiently. However,  [Modern Bank Runs](Reflections%20On%20[[Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock) a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]]'s use of securitisation was aggressive and excessive. Its business model relied heavily upon the securitisation markets being open and accessible. The bank ran a large amount of interest rate and refinancing risk. And a lack of diversification meant that one single shock - a [liquidity shock](Fear%20of%20Fire%20Sales%20Illiquidity%20Seeking%20and%20Credit%20Freezes.md) in this case - would render the entire business non-viable very quickly. As [liquidity](../Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) dried up,  they were forced to hold on to assets they were planning to securitize.

The [FSA supervision](.md) was weak,  chaotic,  and potentially even negligent. Supervisors were busy on other matters,  such as M&A activity in the UK [banking](../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) sector at that time (eg. Abbey,  ABN Amro) and implementing Basel II. [Modern Bank Runs](Reflections%20On%20[[Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock) a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] was not seen as a "high impact" firm. There was little [Introduction](Week%201%20[[Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Introduction) to [Financial Analysis](../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/BMW%20Valuation.md)|[financial analysis](../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/BMW%20Valuation.md)]] in FSA methodologies,  and so [Modern Bank Runs](Reflections%20On%20[[Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock) a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]]'s perilous risk profile was not explored; in fact,  the FSA decided to conduct supervisory reviews on a 36-month cycle. When reviews were conducted,  the work was over-delegated.

"Although [liquidity](../Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) was included within the February 2006 ARROW visit to [Modern Bank Runs](Reflections%20On%20[[Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock) a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]]'s treasury,  it was not explored fully; the visit did not,  for example,  review the firm's stress testing. […] The intention was to include it in the Pillar 2 ICAAP *work,  but this was not scheduled until* […] 25-26 April 2007. […] The objectives of the review did not include wider questions about the implications or adequacy of the [liquidity](../Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) component of firms' business models."

### Liquidity gap,  panic,  and bank run

[Modern Bank Runs](Reflections%20On%20[[Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock) a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] caused some concern in June 2007,  when it issued a profit warning due to shifts in market [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md),  which negatively impacted its interest margins. Nonetheless,  it confidently announced a progressive dividend policy the following month: "*The benefits of Basel II enable us to increase our 2007 interim dividend by 30%. Going forward,  our dividend payout rate increases to 50% of underlying EPS from around 40%*"

Global market conditions took a turn for the worse in August 2007. At that time,  [Modern Bank Runs](Reflections%20On%20[[Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock) a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] was preparing a large [securitization](../../../Financial%20Engineering/10.%20Other%20Topics%20in%20Quantitative%20Finance.md) deal,  which became impossible to execute. It had built up several billion pounds worth of mortgage assets on its balance sheet,  which were funded on a short-term basis. Market funding sources dried up,  and [Modern Bank Runs](Reflections%20On%20[[Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock) a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] was shortly forced to seek government funding support. Unfortunately,  just before the emergency financial support was announced,  its details were leaked by the BBC,  causing sensation and precipitating a retail deposit run. This was a PR disaster. The head of the FSA noted to Parliament: "*It was extremely unfortunate that the information leaked because it meant that instead of this being put in place as,  'This is a solvent institution which has a [cash flow](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) problem and the Government is steppingin to make sure that it is saved',  it became a panic measure or a response to something that was already in the making. Panic was how it was seen."

As funding conditions continued to deteriorate,  [Modern Bank Runs](Reflections%20On%20[[Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock) a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] sought buyers,  but there was little interest unless the government would commit substantial funding (in the region of £30bn) as part of the deal. The government refused to do this,  and [Modern Bank Runs](Reflections%20On%20[[Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock) a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] was nationalised on 22 February 2008.

### Lessons to be drawn from this case study

[Modern Bank Runs](Reflections%20On%20[[Reflections%20On%20Modern%20Bank%20Runs%20a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Northern%20Rock) a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]]'s lack of diversification in its business model meant that it had little resilience. Its capital ratios did not reflect the massive amount of risk that was building up in the balance sheet. These financial weaknesses combined with poor supervision to form a lethal combination in a bank which,  whilst small,  was growing rapidly and was big enough to matter.

Diversification,  resilience,  adequate financial resources,  and strong oversight of the business are all essential for a bank to survive and prosper.
