Notes: This figure plots summary statistics for fraction flows (one-day difference in log assets) to/from [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market mutual fund]] share classes in different aggregate categories during September and October 2008. For each category,  panel A displays the daily percentage flow,  while panel B plots the cumulative flow (in billions of dollars) over this period. Panel C presents a histogram of the cross-sectional distribution of fund-level percentage change in total assets under management for share classes within each category during September 1519 (i.e.,  flows during the MMMF crisis week following the failure of Lehman Brothers,  which is indicated by shading)

# The MMF run of 2020 and the US Fed's response

Data from Federal Reserve Bank of NY Business 35202 Spring 2022

[[Runs On Money Market Mutual Funds|Liquidity mismatch]] and mutual fund runs,  March 2020.

- We saw runs on prime [[A [[An Asset Allocation Primer|Primer]] on Money Market Mutual Funds|[[Breaking the Buck|money market funds]]]] (mainly in institutiona!),  on longer-term [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] grade bond funds with falling prices for both [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] grade bonds and even more rapidly falling prices for ETF funds holding [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] grade bonds.

 Issuance of [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] slowed,  even longer term government bonds dropped in price in mid March.

- A classic flight to [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]]. As longer term,  assets were sold to raise cash. Even US government bonds fell (when expected to rise).
- This was a pattern in pre Federal Reserve times,  where a flight to [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] depressed long-term bond prices apart from [[Default Risk and Credit Derivatives 183|default risk]].

# Summary

- Initial Shock ([[Moody's Approach to Assessing the Adequacy of Liquidity Risk Insurance|corporate liquidity]] and solvency,  unlike 2008)
- A [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] demand shock with different effects on assets thought to be held as [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] for businesses and assets held in long-term portfolios (insurance companies) who do not actively trade (making them safe and less liquid).

# Summary

- IG assets,  almost like governments,  had been expected to go up in a flight to [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]],  but the [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] demand increase from businesses and the belief that even some IG firms could default if Covid-19 crisis persisted,  lead to their decline.
- This could have been exacerbated by this switch from their flight to [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] “beta" flipping from negative (go up in flight) to positive (go down in flight to [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]]).
- ETFs were the most liquid market for IG bonds,  and their prices were the best "market" prices.

## What was the initial shock?

 Covid-19 demand shocks (primary and lock-down induced),  to future [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] needs of small and medium businesses (and some large businesses) They took down lines of credit and sold assets to raise [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] while they could. They likely held safer assets for [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] purposes,  because in normal times there is less price impact for an idiosyncratic sell order.

But there was aggregate selling which would push down prices absent outsiders or [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the fed]] stepping in to buy.

No corporate demand for [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] in 2008-10 crisis.

ETFs largely internalize the trading costs of a redemption,  like a “real" floating NAV.

- With a stale price NAV or a use of liquid assets to avoid liquidation of fire sale prices,  a redemption of x% of shares forces eventual liquidation of more than x% of assets if the redemption pattern persists (or is expected to persist,  as in a run),  with a lower future NAV price.

 If a same-day prorata slice trade could occur,  the price impact would be immediate and the amount of assets liquidated would be closer to x% and the future NAV price closer to the "same day" NAV.

ETF APs effectively do the same day pro-rata slice trade (or charge for holding and not doing it immediately),  making a run less likely.
