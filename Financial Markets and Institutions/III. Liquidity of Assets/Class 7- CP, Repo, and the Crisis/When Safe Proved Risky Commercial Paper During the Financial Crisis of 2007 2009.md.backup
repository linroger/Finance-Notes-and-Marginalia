The founder of the [Reserve Primary Fund](../Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Breaking%20the%20Buck.md)—Bruce Bent—who had been one of the pioneers of the money market industry— had publicly expressed the view that [Primer](A%20[[An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer) on Money Market Mutual Funds|[money market funds](../Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Breaking%20the%20Buck.md)]] should not invest in [](Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper) because it was too risky. In line with this view,  until September 2005,  the [Reserve Primary Fund](../Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Breaking%20the%20Buck.md) stated in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the fund did not invest in [](Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20–%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper).
