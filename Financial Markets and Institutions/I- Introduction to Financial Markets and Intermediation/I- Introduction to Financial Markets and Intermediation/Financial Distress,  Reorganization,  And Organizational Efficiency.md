# Financial Distress, Reorganization, and Organizational Efficiency

This paper examines financial distress and its effect on organizational efficiency. Imperfect information and conflicts of interest among the firm's claimholders influence the outcome of financial distress. Methods for resolving distress and controlling conflicts of interest are discussed. New evidence on financial restructuring and distress costs is presented along with evidence on the organizational restructuring that accompanies financial distress. The evidence demonstrates that financial distress has benefits as well as costs, and that financial and ownership structure affect the net costs.

## 1. Introduction

Financial distress has changed dramatically over the last decade, in part because of major changes in the law and in financial markets. Since the adoption of the Bankruptcy Reform Act in October 1979, the number of Chapter 11 petitions has increased greatly. In 1980, the first full year after the new bankruptcy act, the number of bankruptcy petition filings increased 85% to 5,637, up from 3,042 in 1979. In addition, since October 1979 there have been more than 20 Chapter 11 filings involving over $1 billion in liabilities. Texaco's Chapter 11 filing in April 1987 was the largest in U.S.

history, with $21.6 billion in liabilities; Campeau filed the second largest bankruptcy petition, in January 1990, with $9.9 billion in liabilities. The size of the liabilities and the circumstances surrounding many of the filings - legal judgments, product-liability claims, labor problems, leveraged acquisitions and leveraged buyouts - have stimulated debate and controversy among the press, investors, and researchers.

In financial markets over the last decade, firms began to substitute public original-issue high-yield debt, so-called junk bonds, for commercial loans from the banking and insurance sector. The number of new high-yield debt offerings increased from 22 in 1977 to a peak of 217 in 1986, falling to 111 in 1989. Through both takeovers and voluntary changes in capital structure, high-yield debt has facilitated the restructuring of many U.S. corporations. In addition, the development of a liquid market for high-yield debt focused attention on private workouts and exchange offers often used by firms to resolve financial distress. The number of investors buying and selling the securities of distressed firms and the capital available for such investments has grown spectacularly. Some of these 'vulture capitalists' accumulate positions and participate directly in negotiations to reorganize the firm.

Financial distress is an emerging field steeped in confusion and complexity.

Some of the confusion can be resolved by understanding the diverse nature of financial distress; it is not synonymous with corporate death. Firms in distress face a variety of situations having very different effects on their values and claimholders. This diversity, in conjunction with conflicts of interest among claimholders, leads to an information problem that makes valuing a distressed firm difficult. The valuation problems exacerbate the conflicts of interest. Section 2 of this paper discusses the nature of financial distress, conflicts of interest, and the information problem facing a distressed firm's claimholders. Firms can resolve financial distress privately through a workout or liquidation, or under the supervision of the Bankruptcy Court.

Section 3 discussed the methods available for resolving distress and evidence on the factors affecting their use.

Until recently, research on financial distress focused on distress costs and financial restructuring. The possibility that financial distress could result in beneficial outcomes was generally ignored. New empirical evidence demonstrates that financial distress has both benefits and costs, and that financial and ownership structure affect the net costs. Financial distress is often accompanied by comprehensive organizational changes in management, governance, and structure. This organizational restructuring can create value by improving the use of resources. For example, individual firms in declining industries tend to continue to operate and invest in economic activities even though efficiency dictates a capacity reduction. Financial distress frees resources to move to higher-valued uses by forcing managers and directors to reduce capacity and to rethink operating policies and strategy decisions. This kind of organizational change is unlikely to occur in an all-equity firm,

because without leverage, poor performance does not lead to financial distress. It is financial distress that gives creditors a legal right to demand restructuring. Section 4 discusses the benefits and costs of financial distress, and presents evidence on the performance of distressed firms in Japan. Section 5 concludes.

### 2.1. A Definition of Financial Distress

This paper defines financial distress as a situation where cash flow is insufficient to cover current obligations. These obligations can include unpaid debts to suppliers and employees, actual or potential damages from litigation, and missed principal or interest payments under borrowing agreements

(default). Technical default, the violation of a debt covenant other than one specifying principal and interest payments (e.g., minimum-net-worth requirements or working-capital constraints), can be a warning that distress is imminent. Financial distress generally leads to negotiations with at least one of the firm's creditors. Cross-default provisions are debt covenants in which default on one debt security is a condition for technical default on another.

Such provisions result in much more complicated negotiations to resolve distress.

Some confusion arises because the word insolvent is often used as a synonym for financial distress. Insolvency can be interpreted as pertaining to stocks or flows, and the two are often confused. For example, *Webster's New* World Dictionary (Second College Edition) defines 'insolvent' first as 'not enough to pay all debts' and then as 'unable to pay debts as they become due'. A stock-based definition describes as insolvent a firm with a negative economic net worth: the present value of its cash flows is less that its total obligations. A firm in financial distress is insolvent on a flow basis, it is unable to meet current cash obligations. Flow-based insolvency gives unpaid creditors the right to demand restructuring because their contract with the firm has been breached. If a firm is insolvent on a stock basis, but solvent on a flow basis, it creditors have little power, because their claims are paid to date. Creditors can expect little help from shareholders in such a situation

This should not be confused with negative net worth in an accounting sense. The accounting balance sheet for a healthy firm can show total assets less than total liabilities. For example, Sealed Air Corporation, a New York Stock Exchange firm, completed a leveraged recapitalization in July 1989 that left it with a negative accounting net worth of over $160 million. The company has had no problems meeting debt service and is a year ahead of schedule in paying off its debt [Wruck (1990)].

Altman (1983) discusses in detail the different ways insolvency is defined. He labels the flow definition of insolvency 'technical insolvency' and the stock definition as 'insolvency in a bankruptcy sense'.

because their equity claims are still valuable. In the unlikely event that firm value increases dramatically, shareholders capture the benefits.

Bankruptcy and liquidation are also used as synonyms for financial distress.

In this paper, bankruptcy refers to the court-supervised process for breaking and rewriting contracts. Liquidation refers to a sale of the firm's assets and distribution of proceeds to claimants.

### 2.2. The Information Problem and Conflicts of Interest

The information problem faced by a distressed firm's claimholders is how to obtain reliable data to determine whether the firm is insolvent on a stock, as well as a flow basis. The extreme examples presented in fig. 1 help illustrate the problem. It shows actual cash flows for two firms. At time 1 the firms have identical historical cash flows, and future cash flows through time 2 are identical. It is only after time 2 that cash flows will differ. At time 1 both firms become distressed. The firm in panel A is insolvent on both a stock and a flow basis - cash flow after time 1 is permanently lower than the level of obligations. The panel B firm is insolvent on a flow basis only. Its cash flow will return to pre-distress levels after time 2.

The information problem boils down to deciding whether a distressed firm's situation is better described by panel A or panel B. It is important because the value-maximizing way to resolve distress differs between panels.

The panel B firm can meet its obligations by persuading claimants to agree to a new payment schedule. Except for the costs of renegotiating, it suffers no penalty for financial distress. Resolving distress for the panel A firm requires major effort, including reducing fixed claims or reorganizing (if feasible) in a way that creates enough value to cover the claims.

At the time of financial distress (time 1) investors know the history of actual cash flows, but must make predictions about future cash flows with incomplete information. This can lead to honest disagreement about the firm's future prospects. Even if all parties could accurately predict future cash flows, there would still be conflict over the best way to resolve distress, because different reorganization policies distribute wealth across managers, creditors, and shareholders differently. Therefore, reorganization policies are advocated both out of concern for value maximization and out of self-interest. Where the two differ, there is potential for value-destroying behavior. As discussed in detail in section 4.4.1, the rules of the game for reorganization in the U.S. exacerbate these conflicts.

In pursuing their own interests, claimants have incentives to present biased and inaccurate data as though it were unbiased and accurate. Shareholders have incentives to claim the firm is insolvent only on a flow basis (like the panel B firm) because it increases the likelihood that they will retain their equity stake and therefore preserve the option value of their claim. Creditors have incentives to claim the firm is insolvent on a stock basis (like the panel A firm) because it increases the likelihood that they will be awarded the equity. Managers have an incentive to side with the party less likely to fire them. Resolving these conflicts consumes resources and in the extreme can destroy huge amounts of value. For example, a panel B firm can be turned into a panel A firm as claimants fight over the distribution of wealth, or if a value-reducing reorganization policy is chosen because it furthers the interests of a persuasive class of claimants.

Panels A and B illustrate actual cash flows for two firms that become flow-based insolvent at time 1. Investors in a distressed firm face an information problem - they cannot tell whether their firm has cash flows more like those in panel A or B. The firm in panel A is insolvent due to a permanent reduction in cash flow, while the firm in panel B is insolvent due to a temporary reduction in cash flow - at time 2 its cash flow returns to a pre-distress level. Cash flows at the time of financial distress are identical for the two firms. At time 1, no one has both the relevant information about cash flows and the incentive to reveal it to the firm's claimholders. Out of self-interest shareholders will argue that panel B represents the firm's situation, while creditors will argue that panel A is more realistic. Managers will tend to side with the party less likely fire them.

The most reliable estimate of future cash flows can be obtained when accurate information is shared by managers and claimholders. Managers generally have better information about the firm's internal operations than outside investors, but they may lack the ability or incentives to make the best use of that information. A management team committed to a poor strategy or to preserving its control over the firm is using its superior information to make poor decisions. Despite their lack of detailed information about the firm's operations, both creditors and shareholders are often better able to assess the firm's situation. Large creditors have employees who are expert analysts, and in addition creditors sometimes receive special reports from the firm containing information not available to the public. Active shareholders are often better able to assess industry trends, the firm's strategy, and the effectiveness of top management. Unfortunately, no party has both the information and incentives to reveal that information to others.

Workout specialists, whose reputation suffers if they mislead claimholders, could help solve the information problem. As such a specialist, Drexel Burnham Lambert's ability to execute hundreds of exchange offers in the high-yield market suggests that its reputation played a role in attenuating information problems. The role of specialists in resolving financial distress quickly and inexpensively has been drastically curtailed with the demise of Drexel and by recent court decisions. In particular, Judge Lifland's January 1990 decision in the LTV bankruptcy case makes it more costly to resolve distress outside the courtroom. He ruled that LTV's bondholders who participated in out-of-court exchange offers before the firm's Chapter 11 filing were not entitled to a claim equal to the face value of their old bonds.

Instead their claims were limited to the market value of their new bonds.

Since this decision only one major private workout has been successfully completed, and it was structured to circumvent the effect of his ruling should the firm later file Chapter 11.

See 'U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rules in Favor of LTV', January 31, 1990. Reuters Newswire.

The successful workout referred to above was an exchange offer completed on February 5, 1990

by SCI TV. The company, formerly owned by Storer, went private and was later taken public by UR and George Gillett in 1987. All of SCI's banks and 95% of its publicly traded debt participated in the restructuring. Each creditor class agreed to approximately the same proportional reduction in its claims, so that in the event of Chapter 11 it would suffer the same percentage reduction in its allowable claims. (See 'SCI TV Completes Exchange Offer Or Notes, Debentures', February 5, 1990, Reuters Newswire.)

## 3. Resolving Financial Distress

Financial distress is resolved in an environment of imperfect information and conflicts of interest. Yet evidence on the frequency distribution of outcomes for firms in distress proves that it is not synonymous with corporate death. Financial distress is often resolved through private workouts or legal reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Only much more rarely are distressed firms liquidated under Chapter 7 of the code. Fig. 2 traces firms in financial distress to their final outcomes based on data from five empirical studies. From left to right the figure presents the sample criteria for each study and follows each set of sample firms to their final outcomes. Gilson (1989, 1990) and Gilson, John, and Lang (1990) provide evidence on the fate of firms that experienced extremely poor stock-price performance. Weiss (1990) and Morse and Shaw (1988) provide evidence on outcomes for firms filing Chapter 11.
