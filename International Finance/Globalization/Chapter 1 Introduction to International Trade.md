## **Chapter 1**

# **Introduction**

Imagine you arrive from outer space to visit planet Earth for the first time. You wish to study how the residents of Earth live with one another. You start by beaming yourself around the planet and meet a random sample of four people: Issa from rural India, Julia from Rio de Janeiro, Chao from Shanghai, and Mike from rural California. These people do not know each other, but they are connected.

Issa knows of the United States because her family can, for the first time, afford a mud hut. The small and tough guar bean her family grows in the Indian desert has become a crucial component for oil and gas extraction equipment used in the United States to perform a process called *fracking*. 1 But Issa is worried that the Monsoon rains might be meager this year, and farmers elsewhere on the globe could become successful growers of guar beans too. Julia rents out apartments to shortterm visitors in Rio de Janeiro. She wonders about her fellow Brazilians whose families became rich growing coffee. Instead of drinking traditional *cafezinho* cups of coffee, they now slurp foreign brands of espresso or latte. Meanwhile, her relatives ship soybeans to China for animal feed.

Chao is an older man and still wonders how in less than a generation he, his wife, and son have escaped poverty and come to live in an urban apartment in Shanghai, eating meals his family could never have afforded when he was a child. But Chao worries that his employer in the garment industry is running into difficult times, and wonders why his country purchases passenger airplanes from Brazil rather than manufacturing them. Mike works from home as a software developer for a Californian technology company. Together with a small team in India, he programs electronic components that are produced in China and Brazil. His cell phone runs on these components, and he worries that it does not take many programmers to make smart phones. Mike is also concerned with the environmental consequences of the new fracking technology
