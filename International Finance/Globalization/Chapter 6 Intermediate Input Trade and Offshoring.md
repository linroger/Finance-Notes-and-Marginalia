# **Chapter 6**

# **Intermediate Input Trade and Offshoring**

If you just had a cup of coffee, you are not alone. Every day, consumers around the world drink an estimated 1.5 billion cups of coffee. Three-hundred million cups are served daily just in the United States. In many regards, coffee is today's most ubiquitous global good. How does the coffee from distant farms end up in your cup? How does the global supply chain for coffee connect, and what does its organization imply for the distribution of the gains from the trade and people's incomes?

Let's start with the coffee growers. Millions of farmers, mostly in developing countries, prepare the crop and harvest the beans. Coffee is the third-most traded agricultural commodity after wheat and corn.<sup>1</sup> The farmers' incomes and those of many economies depend on the price of the beans, which is mainly determined on commodity exchanges in London and New York.

Global traders acquire the beans from farmers or their cooperatives at the world market price set on the exchanges. The traders then screen, sort, and store the raw beans, and sell them on to roasters. The roasters finally blend, roast, grind and package the coffee, mostly in developed countries. Roughly three-quarters of the value added in your cup accrues between a seaport near you and the retail shelve at your supermarket, or the espresso machine at your favorite cafe.´

## **Learning Objectives**

After reading this chapter you should be able to:

- **LO1** Explain how the trade in intermediate goods alters the assumptions of classic trade theory.
- **LO2** Elaborate how production stages can be ranked by their skill intensity. Then explain how a fall in the costs of offshoring leads to shifts of production stages across countries and affects income inequality within economies.
- **LO3** Describe how tasks can be ranked by contracting costs, demonstrate why cost savings arise when workers abroad perform certain tasks, and analyze what a drop in average contracting costs implies for income ineq
