# *The Great Doubling of the Global Workforce*

Some of the most consequential changes to the global economy don't make big news. When you think about the striking images from your recent morning news show or podcast, chances are that you recall pictures of an extreme weather event, a major sports figure, or stories on political breakthroughs or failures in the headlines. By contrast, the *Great Doubling* of the global workforce never made it into the headlines, even though it is arguably the most significant economic change we have witnessed in decades. Its consequences are still playing out.

The globalized labor force in the world's open economies in 1980 consisted of roughly 1 billion people. By 2000, the population growth in those open economies had increased the number to about 1.5 billion workers. However, during this same time period, the Soviet Union collapsed, and with it socialism in this country and its neighbors. Meanwhile, China shifted to capitalism, and India adopted open-market policies. As they globalized, workforces in these economies contributed another 1.5 billion workers to the global labor pool—effectively doubling the size of the world's nowconnected workforce to 3 billion people. Richard B. Freeman of Harvard University calls this expansion of the global labor pool the Great Doubling.<sup>1</sup> How have production arrangements and trade responded? How have workers been affected? Which sectors expanded and will continue to expand? Which will not? Where will individual industries be located in this newly specializing world?

To answer those questions, this chapter puts Ricardo's ideas and the principle of comparative advantage to work: first in a world with two sectors, and then in a richer world with many industries. Similar to the preceding chapter, the production possibility frontier (PPF) is a powerful graphical device to summarize comparative advantage when there are just two sectors. To study how
