# **Chapter 2 The Principle of Comparative Advantage**

Imagine a place that grows avocados, strawberries, lemons, and almonds all at lower prices than anywhere else in the world. The same place also makes motorcycles, skateboards, laptops, and mobile apps. Whatever it makes is more competitively priced than in any other country. Should this place trade its products with other people around the world? After all, no growers and manufacturers elsewhere can match the imaginary place's prices. Moreover, what goods would other suppliers around the globe have to offer since it appears they would have little chance to compete?

As it turns out, a solid economic answer to these questions has been known for two centuries and reconfirmed again and again ever since: It would be foolish for the residents of the imaginary place—and equally foolish for residents everywhere else in the world—*not* to trade with other people and firms abroad. Economies will, and should, globalize.

## **Learning Objectives**

- **LO1** Understand why a comparative advantage is based on opportunity costs and explain why it is a double comparison.
- **LO2** Describe the production possibility frontier and explain how unit labor requirements determine its slope. Then use the slope to determine an industry and country's comparative advantage.
- **LO3** Explain the assumptions on labor mobility between industries and between countries. Define the Law of One Price for goods.
- **LO4** Determine the relative world price. Show how the international trade line allows you to determine the pattern of specialization and trade in the Ricardian model and estimate the gains from trade.
- **L05** Define the Balassa measure of revealed comparative advantage and explain why it is a double comparison.
