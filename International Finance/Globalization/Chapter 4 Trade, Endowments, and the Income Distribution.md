## **Chapter 4**

# **Trade, Endowments, and the Income Distribution**

The dispersion of incomes within countries has risen steadily over the past five or six decades. Today, more than half of the worldwide income inequality is due to the within-country income disparities. At no time since the last World War has the average within-country disparity been larger.<sup>1</sup> Although the within-country income disparity has risen on average around the world, in countries such as Brazil, China, Germany, India, and Mexico it has actually come down and dropped markedly. In contrast, income inequality within Japan, Russia, and South Africa has increased. In the United Kingdom and the United States the inequality in incomes jumped up drastically even before the Great Recession.<sup>2</sup> Rising inequality is a concern because it is often related to increasing poverty, and inequality can coincide with political conflict and a high crime rate. Numerous economic changes can affect income inequality, including a nation's technical progress, innovation, and the perpetual shift in people's tastes and demands. Can globalization explain why income inequality widens in some regions and narrows elsewhere?

### **4.1 Comparative Advantage in the Heckscher–Ohlin Model**

The **Heckscher–Ohlin model** is a classical model of trade that many economists today use as a complement, or as an alternative, to the Ricardian trade model. The theory offers a novel explanation for the origins of globalization. If sectors use identical technologies everywhere in the world, perhaps because production knowledge has spread globally, then it is possible that the Ricardian explanation for trade based on technology misses important aspects. In the Heckscher–Ohlin model, trade depends upon a combination of economic forces: a country's resources such as skilled labor, the character of the industries, and how intensely they each use those resources. By contrast, in the Ricardian model trade patterns are simply the result of country- and industry-specific technologies that yield a certain labor productivity.

Having studied the first wave of globalization, the Swedish economic historian Eli Heckscher 1919 first outlined the model (translated as Eli F. Heckscher 1991) and his doctoral student Bertil Ohlin 1924 formalized its setup (translated as Bertil Ohlin 1991). The pattern of trade in their time motivated their thinking: Global trade flows coming from the "new world" (the Americas and Oceania) as well as parts of Asia and Africa brought products derived from natural resources. In exchange, Europe and parts of North America shipped their labor-intensive manufactured goods. Bertil Ohlin introduced the idea this way (Harry Flam and M. June Flanders 1991, p. 90):

Australia has a small population and an abundant supply of land. . . . Land is consequently cheap and wages high, in relation to most other countries. . . . Australia exchanges wool and wheat for industrial products since the former embody much land and little labour while the opposite is true of industrial products. Australian land is thus exchanged for European labour.

While the relative abundance of land drove trade patterns during the first global century from around 1820 until the First World War, labor skills are a decisive resource in our second global century that began after the Second World War and persists today. To understand the Heckscher–Ohlin model, let's consider a modern variation with two types of labor: high-skilled engineers *H* and low-skilled laborers *L*. The different pay for skills is a main source of income dispersion.

### **Factor Endowments: Country Characteristics**

Every country has a supply of human resources, which are referred to as an **endowment**. Other factor endowments include a country's physical capital and arable land. These resources are factors of production and used to generate output. Suppose there are two countries. The home country is endowed with a number *H* of engineers and a number *L* of laborers. The foreign economy, which is marked with an asterisk, is endowed with  $H^*$  engineers and  $L^*$  laborers. A factor endowment is a *country characteristic*. We say a country is relatively *abundant* in a factor if the country is relatively well endowed with that factor. Stated more concretely, we define a relatively abundant endowment:The home country is relatively abundant in factor *H* in terms of the *L* factor if *H/L > H∗ > L∗* .

### Relative Factor Endowments by Income Group Relative Factor Endowments by Country

*Notes*: Average years of schooling are for the country's population over 25 years old; physical capital in international (Geary-Khamis) dollars; arable land in hectars. All three endowment measures are per worker (Penn World Table 6.1) and divided by the measure for the United States. In the left panel, OECD countries exclude the Unites States, countries "above median" have real GDP per worker (in international Geary-Khamis dollars) at or above world median, those "below median" have strictly less. Right panel shows countries in descending order of real GDP per worker.

Figure 4.1: Factor Endowments per Worker Relative to the United States

Conversely, a country is relatively *scarce* in a factor if the country has a relatively small endowment of that factor. When the variable *H* or *L* of a factor carries no subscript, then it denotes a country endowment.

Figure 4.1 shows endowments of human capital per worker (measured in years of schooling per resident 25 years of age or older), physical capital per worker, and arable land per worker—and presents all three measures relative to the United States. Endowments differ considerably between groups of countries. The left panel of the figure shows that the average member country of the OECD (a club of countries with high incomes per capita) has a schooling level of 73 percent of that in the U.S. workforce, a capital stock per worker that is 88 percent of the U.S. level, and arable land that is 62 percent of the U.S. endowment per worker. In contrast, residents of countries outside the OECD have much smaller factor endowments per worker at their disposal: they only have 39 percent of the U.S. schooling per worker, merely 17 percent of the U.S. physical capital per worker, and just 37 percent of the arable land per worker.

A country's human capital appears to be closely associated with its income per worker. The right panel of the figure shows countries in the order of their GDP per worker at the turn of the millennium: the United States with the highest income per worker, and China with the lowest. Some high-income countries such as France and Japan have more physical capital per worker than the United States. But their average schooling is below that in the United States and presumably more closely associated with their lower per-capita incomes. While endowments of capital and land appear to vary in many ways among the lower-income countries such as South Korea, Chile, Mexico, India and China, schooling per worker among these countries is systematically lower the smaller is their per-capita income. In short, there might be a close connection between schooling and incomes across countries. Our main interest in this chapter, however, is the distribution of incomes within countries,

and for that matter we need to know more about the sectors in which the economies specialize and how much schooling the sectors demand.

### **Factor Intensities: Sector Characteristics**

Let's consider two sectors on the demand side for the factors of production.. As before, we assume that every sector produces with constant returns to scale. However, in contrast to the Ricardian trade model, every sector now combines two factors of production in the production process. Constant returns to scale now mean that when a sector doubles the inputs of both factors of production, then output doubles. Likewise, when the sector triples both factor inputs, then its output triples. Conversely, when a sector cuts both factor inputs in half, then its output drops by half. However, when the sector doubles only one factor input, then output less than doubles. When the sector cuts only one factor input in half, then output shrinks by less than half.

Sectors differ in the extent to which they use the factors of production. Each sector's demand for the factors depends on the sector's **factor intensity**. For example, a sector *i* intensely uses the *H* factor of production if  $H_i/L_i$  is relatively high compared to other sectors. For example, specialized equipment manufacturers and the chemicals industry employ a high proportion of non-production workers in offices relative to production workers on the shop floor (with  $H_i/L_i$  ratios of 1.16 and 0.74), whereas the lumber and wood product industry and textile mills employ relatively many production workers in today's economy (with  $H_i/L_i$  ratios of 0.28 and 0.22). Stated more concretely, we define:A sector *i*'s factor intensity of the *H* factor in terms of the *L* factor is *Hi/L<sup>i</sup>* .

When the variable *H<sup>i</sup>* or *L<sup>i</sup>* does carry a subscript, then the variable denotes the factor's employment in the sector of the subscript. The factor intensity is a *sector characteristic*.

High-skilled engineers in each country earn the wage *wH*, and low-skilled laborers earn the wage *wL*. Workers are mobile across sectors within a country, but every factor is trapped within its country's borders. In other words, workers can move from sector to sector within each country but not move from country to country. In equilibrium, high-skilled workers in any sector all earn the same wage *w<sup>H</sup>* as the high-skilled workers employed in another sector. Low-skilled laborers also earn the same wage *w<sup>L</sup>* no matter in which sector they are employed. If any sector were to pay a higher wage, the worker would switch employment. In equilibrium, when no worker wants to switch jobs, each skill group of workers must therefore earn the same wage.

Heckscher and Olin theorized that the combined country characteristics (factor endowments) and sector characteristics (factor intensities) are a driving force of globalization and trade. To isolate this force of globalization, let's assume every sector *i* produces its output *Q<sup>i</sup>* with identical technology everywhere in the world. In other words, there are no technological differences across countries.<sup>3</sup>

Sectors do differ between each other in terms of their production technology and therefore their factor intensities *Hi/L<sup>i</sup>* . A crucial variable in our analysis will be the ratio of earnings of these production factors, *wH/wL*. We therefore assign a name to this factor price ratio: *wH/w<sup>L</sup>* is the **skill premium**. The skill premium measures the higher earnings high-skilled workers command compared to low-skilled workers' earnings.

<sup>3</sup>The two main insights in this chapter—-on the consequences of trade (Stolper–Samuelson theorm) and migration (Rybczynski theorem) for inequality—do in fact not depend on the assumption that technologies are the same in all countries. This will become clear in the upcoming Chapter 5 when we allow productivity to differ between countries and both theorems still hold.

How factors are best combined depends on the sector and on the country. How can we then regard factor intensity as a sector characteristic? As so often in trade theory, only relative characteristics matter. In the case of Heckscher—Ohlin trade theory, when we compare sectors to each other, one sector needs to be more intensive in a production factor than the other. Concretely, for each of the countries in our example, let's assume that for any given skill premium *wH/wL*, the manufacturing sector exhibits a stronger high-skilled intensity than the agriculture sector so that

*HM/L<sup>M</sup> > HA/L<sup>A</sup>* for any *wH/wL.*

Given this assumption, the manufacturing sector needs relatively more engineers per laborer, whereas the agriculture sector needs relatively more laborers per engineer.

We now have all the ingredients in place that make up the basic Heckscher–Ohlin model and we can start to derive the main insights. There are several important predictions of this model, and theorems summarize those predictions. Each theorem is a result that inevitably follows from the fundamentals of the model (as listed here). First, the **Heckscher–Ohlin theorem** (about the Heckscher–Ohlin *model*) states how factor abundance and the sectors' factor intensities predict trade flows. Second, you will see how changing trade flows and product prices translate back into a country's income distribution because they affect the production factors' earnings in the Heckscher–Ohlin model; this is the **Stolper–Samuelson theorem**. Third, you will get to know how migration relates to trade and factor earnings in the model; that is what the **Rybczynski theorem** covers. In the next chapter, you will finally see under what conditions the Heckscher–Ohlin model predicts that factor earnings around the world will become more similar to each other (the Factor Price Equalization theorem). One model, four theorems.

### **Comparative Advantage**

#### **Fundamentals.**

- *• Key force*: **Differences in factor intensities** *and* **endowments** (identical sector technologies across countries)
- *•* Factors of production: 2 (high-skilled *H* and low-skilled *L*)
- *•* Factor mobility: Each factor mobile between sectors, immobile across borders
- *•* Sectors (goods): 2. Agriculture *Q<sup>A</sup>* and Manufacturing *QM*; *Q<sup>i</sup>* made with *H<sup>i</sup>* and *Li*
- *•* Production stages: 1 single final stage
- *•* Countries: 2 (Home and rest of world Foreign*∗* )
- *•* Perfect competition, transport costs: 0
- *•* Constant returns to scale
- *•* Balanced trade
- *•* Contracts perfectly enforceable

What gives rise to comparative advantage using the Heckscher–Ohlin model? In the pure form of the model, there are no differences in technology between countries. Instead, the interplay of factor intensities and a country's factor endowments determines opportunity cost. In a country with many high-skilled engineers, the skill premium paid to them is relatively low  $(w_H/w_L < w_H^*/w_L^*)$ . In this country, all sectors use relatively more engineers. But the manufacturing sector in particular needs a higher proportion of engineers than does agriculture. In which country will the opportunity costs of manufacturing be low? Will it be in the high-skill abundant country or the low-skill abundant country? In the high-skill abundant country, the opportunity cost of manufacturing will be lower because that sector uses high-skilled engineers relatively more intensely in production. Similarly,we could say, the relatively high-skill abundant country has a comparative advantage in terms of manufacturing because the manufacturing sector uses high-skilled workers relatively intensively.

We have just found the Heckscher–Ohlin theorem for two countries

**Heckscher–Ohlin Theorem.** If there are two sectors, two countries, and two factors that are mobile between sectors but not countries, then a country exports the good that *intensively* uses the economy's *abundant* factor in production and imports the good that *intensively* uses the economy's *scarce* factor in production.

For example, if the United States is relatively abundant in the skills needed for non-production jobs in offices, then the economy will specialize in equipment manufacturing and the chemicals industry, which intensely use non-production workers. Low-skill abundant countries will specialize in the lumber industry and textile mills, which use low-skilled production workers on the shop floor relatively intensively.

The Heckscher–Ohlin theorem pins down the pattern of trade. The theorem is also called the Factor Proportions Theorem because it relates a country's proportional factor endowment to a sector's proportional use of the factors. A complete graphical and mathematical derivation of this theorem can wait until the next chapter because in this chapter we want to focus on how globalization affects the dispersion of incomes within countries. However, we need to use the basic ideas behind the theorem to determine which sectors will expand during globalization and which will shrink. That will help us understand whose incomes will grow and whose may contract as a result.

The Ricardian trade model uses a single variable to describe everything about comparative advantage: a sector's per-unit labor requirement in a country. Where does this labor productivity come from? The Ricardian model says, labor productivity originates from a technology that a specific sector in an individual country happens master. The Heckscher–Ohlin theory offers another possible answer: Labor productivity is the result of a collaboration, or a synergy, when different types of workers team up with one another to produce an output. When we pair laborers with more engineers, the laborers' productivity increases because they get input from their high-skilled colleagues. The reverse is also true. When we pair high-skilled engineers in a sector with more laborer colleagues, then the engineers' productivity increases because they get additional input from the laborers. In general, if you give one factor of production more of another factor to work with, then both factors will become more productive.

However, the sectors differ with regard to the extra output they get out of the additional input of a skill group. The manufacturing sector gets a relatively stronger boost in output from the additional employment of engineers, whereas the agricultural sector gets a relatively stronger boost in output from the additional employment of laborers. As a consequence, when the country that is relatively abundant in engineers is still in autarky, its price of manufactured goods will be relatively low. Similarly, when the country that is relatively abundant in laborers is still closed, its agricultural goods price will be relatively low. In general, the relative product prices in autarky reflect a country's opportunity cost. So the country abundant in engineers, for example, has a low opportunity cost in the engineering-intensive good and therefore a comparative advantage in the engineering-intensive sector (manufacturing by our convention). In short, when there are two factors of production, two sectors with constant returns to scale, and two countries, then each country exports the goods whose production makes relatively intensive use of the country's abundant factor.

### **4.2 Income Inequality and the Stolper–Samuelson Theorem**

With the Heckscher–Ohlin theorem in place, and the predictions for the pattern of trade known, Wolfgang F. Stolper and Paul A. Samuelson (1941) set out to look inside an economy that joins global trade in goods. How does globalization of the world product markets translate back into employment and earnings inside the economy? In other words, how does global product trade affect income inequality within a country? Their answer is an important finding about the Heckscher–Ohlin model, so important that it received a name of its own: the **Stolper–Samuelson theorem**.

Following Stolper and Samuelson's footsteps, let's investigate the distributional effects of trade in goods on the **factor prices** within a country. The factor price is the pay of a factor, such as the wage earned by labor in our example. For this purpose, we need to find out where the factors of production get employed when the market for them is in equilibrium. Engineers split between agriculture and manufacturing, and so do the laborers:

$$
H_A + H_M = H \qquad \text{and} \qquad L_A + L_M = L.
$$

This is the factor allocation to sectors in the home economy. (In the foreign economy, *H<sup>∗</sup> <sup>A</sup>* + *H<sup>∗</sup> <sup>M</sup>* = *H<sup>∗</sup>* and *L ∗ <sup>A</sup>* + *L ∗ <sup>M</sup>* = *L ∗* .)

#### **The Edgeworth Box**

An **Edgeworth box** (or Edgeworth production box) is a convenient graphical tool used to show how factors are allocated in an economy. In our application, the Edgeworth box is a rectangle whose sides show the factor endowments of an economy (the country characteristics) and whose split of the factors between the two sectors (agriculture and manufacturing) demonstrates how intensely the factors are used (the sector characteristics).<sup>4</sup> Here is how the frame of an Edgeworth box is built. Let's draw a box for the home economy and start with one of the two sectors, say agriculture. In the origin of a diagram with two axes, agriculture employs no high-skilled workers ( $H_A = 0$ ) and no low-skilled workers ( $L_A = 0$ ). The left panel of Figure 4.2 shows this starting point in the lower-left corner. As we move to the right on the horizontal axis, low-skilled employment in agriculture increases. As we move up on the vertical axis high-skilled employment in agriculture increases. How far can we move at most? The maximum employment of low-skilled workers in agriculture is reached when the entire factor endowment of the home economy  $L$  works in agriculture ( $L_A = L$ ). Similarly, the largest possible employment of high-skilled labor in agriculture is the high-skill endowment ( $H_A = H$ ). The left panel of Figure 4.2 depicts those employment limits with dashed lines.We can now draw the same type of box for the manufacturing sector in the home economy. The trick is to do that after turning the page by 180 degrees. That way, you can look down on the same diagram because we are going to start with manufacturing employment in the upper-right corner. The right panel of Figure 4.2 presents the completed diagram. In the upper-right corner, the manufacturing sector employs no high-skilled workers ( $H_M = 0$ ) and no low-skilled workers ( $L_M = 0$ ). Both types of workers are employed only in agriculture ( $L_A = L$  and  $H_A = H$ ). As we move to the left on the horizontal axis, from the manufacturing origin  $0_M$  out, low-skilled employment in manufacturing increases. As we move down the vertical axis, high-skilled employment in manufacturing<sup>4</sup>Vilfredo Pareto (1971) introduced the diagrams that we call Edgeworth boxes today, one for the factor market and one for the product market. Francis Ysidro Edgeworth himself never completed either kind of box. He just presented a sketch. In Edgeworth's spirit, we take the liberty here and do not complete the diagram with all the so-called isoquants that depict production levels or the contract curve that shows the efficient factor market allocations.

![](_page_7_Figure_book-ch4-v3_1.jpeg)

Figure 4.2: Frame of the Edgeworth Box

increases. How far can we move at most? Manufacturing employment reaches the limit when the country's entire factor endowment works in manufacturing ( $L_M = L$  and  $H_M = H$  but  $L_A = 0$  and  $H_A = 0$ ).The shape of the Edgeworth box frame reflects the factor endowments (the country characteristic). A relatively high and narrow frame in the home country, compared to a lower and wider frame in the foreign economy, means that the home country has a relative abundance of high-skilled workers: *H/L > H∗/L∗* . Conversely, a relatively low and wide frame in the home country, compared to the frame shape abroad, means that the home country has a relative abundance of low-skilled workers.

From now on, we'll adopt the convention that the home country has a relative abundance of high-skilled workers

*H/L > H∗ /L∗*

. Under this convention, if we were to depict the frame of the Edgeworth box for the foreign economy, then we would have to draw it even wider and flatter than the one in Figure 4.2 because, if the home economy is relatively abundant in high-skilled workers, then the foreign economy must be relatively abundant in low-skilled workers. That's the definition of relative abundance.

The size of the frame does not matter for an economy's comparative advantage but instead its absolute advantage. Only the shape of the frame matters for the economy's comparative advantage. If the diagonal of the frame is steeper at home than abroad then the home economy is relatively abundant in the factor on the vertical axis (*H*). Factor abundance alone, however, is not enough to establish comparative advantage. As you have learnt from the Heckscher–Ohlin theorem, the factor abundance (the country characteristic) needs to be combined with factor intensities (the sector characteristics) to determine comparative advantage.

#### **Labor Allocation**

Now that we have drawn the frame of the Edgeworth box (the country characteristic), we can turn to employment in the two sectors. In our example, we are assuming that the agricultural sector is less high-skill intensive than manufacturing. In other words, relatively fewer highly skilled workers are needed to produce agricultural goods than are needed to produce manufactured goods. This means that there must be a ranking of the sectors

$$
\frac{H_A}{L_A} < \frac{H}{L} < \frac{H_M}{L_M}
$$

![](_page_8_Figure_book-ch4-v3_1.jpeg)

**Figure 4.3: Labor Allocation to Agriculture and Manufacturing**so that agriculture is less high-skill intensive than the economy-wide average (which equals the endowment ratio  $H/L$ ), and manufacturing is more high-skill intensive than the economy-wide average.In the Edgeworth box, being less high-skill intensive than the economy-wide average means that the **employment arrow** that reflects agricultural production must be flatter than the Edgeworth box's diagonal. The left panel of Figure 4.3 depicts one possible employment arrow for agriculture. The diagonal is drawn with a dotted line. The black dot, where the agricultural employment arrow's tip ends, shows the factor employments  $L_A$  as the horizontal distance from the  $0_A$  origin and  $H_A$  as the vertical distance from the origin.<sup>5</sup> There is full employment in our economy with  $H_A + H_M = H$  and  $L_A + L_M = L$ , so we can infer that manufacturing employment is  $H_M = H - H_A$  and  $L_M = L - L_A$ . Manufacturing employment can be depicted with a second employment arrow, this time with the arrow's foot at the manufacturing origin  $0_M$  and the tip again on the black dot. See the right panel of Figure 4.3. The employment arrows for the two sectors must end tip to tip, otherwise there would be unemployment for at least one production factor. All workers in a skill group  $\ell$  ( $\ell = L$  or  $\ell = H$ ) are the same, so if some want to work at the wage  $w_\ell$ , all of them want to work at that wage; therefore there cannot be unemployment in equilibrium.The slope of each employment arrow shows the relative high-skill intensity used by the sector (for a given skill premium  $w_H/w_L$  in the background). The employment arrow for agriculture is flatter than the diagonal ( $H_A/L_A < H/L$ ), and the diagonal is flatter than the employment arrow for manufacturing ( $H/L < H_M/L_M$ ). In other words, the diagram in Figure 4.3 adheres to our assumption that manufacturing is more high-skill intensive than agriculture is.

**Labor Market Outcomes after Improving Terms of Trade**

In our two-sector example, a country's terms of trade are the price of the country's exported good divided by the price of the country's imported good on the world market:  $ToT = P_{\text{Export good}}/P_{\text{Import good}}$ . We say the terms of trade improve when they increase because, under higher terms of trade, a country can afford more imports for any given volume of goods it exports. We are now ready to analyze how a change in the terms of trade translates into the incomes of the country's residents. Under improving terms of trade, the economy as a whole can afford more imports for consumption. But can every resident afford more consumption?<sup>5</sup> For the geometrically inclined: the coordinates of the employment arrow's tip are  $L_A$  and  $H_A$ .![](_page_9_Figure_book-ch4-v3_1.jpeg)

Figure 4.4: Labor Allocation after Improving Terms of Trade

Suppose the right panel of Figure 4.3 is the economy's initial equilibrium before the terms of trade change. When the economy globalizes, then the relative price of the good it exports increases as foreign consumers demand the exports. The increase in the price then leads the producers of the good being exported to expand their production of it.

In our example, the home economy has a comparative advantage in manufacturing, so the manufacturing sector is the export sector. The question is, if the home economy's terms of trade improve due to globalization, how can the manufacturing sector expand its production to meet the additional demand for manufactured goods? Where will the workers come from? An economy employs all its resources in equilibrium. To make one sector's employment expand, we must therefore have employment in the other sector contract. In the Edgeworth box, the employment arrow of the contracting sector must shrink in size, while the employment arrow of the expanding sector gets longer.

Is it enough to just shrink and augment the employment arrows? The left panel of Figure 4.4 graphs an unsuccessful attempt to just shrink and augment. We shrank the agricultural sector's (blue) employment arrow at the old factor intensity (*HA/LA*). We then augmented the manufacturing sector's (red) employment arrow and maintained the old factor intensity (*HM/LM*). The outcome is clearly not an equilibrium. In fact, no matter what expansion in manufacturing or what contraction in agriculture we try, there cannot be an equilibrium at the old slopes because the employment arrows cannot be tip-to-tip again unless their slopes change. In the scenario depicted in the left panel, there would be unemployment of low-skilled workers and excess demand for high-skilled workers because the expanding manufacturing sector wants to employ relatively more high-skilled workers than the shrinking agricultural sector can lay off.

As a consequence, the employment arrows must turn to change slopes. The employment arrow in manufacturing will turn *towards* the diagonal. Graphically, this is the only way to restore labor market equilibrium with full employment after the terms of trade change and the manufacturing arrow gets longer. The economic reason is that the manufacturing plants only get to hire relatively fewer high-skilled workers than they used to employ. Manufacturing plants can attract new workers only at a lower *HM/L<sup>M</sup>* ratio than before because the agricultural sector used to employ workers at a lower ratio *HA/L<sup>A</sup>* than manufacturing so that there are relatively few high-skilled workers to hire in the expanding manufacturing sector but relatively many low-skilled workers who could move. In short, the manufacturing sector expands employment of both engineers *H<sup>M</sup>* and laborers *L<sup>M</sup>* but the *HM/L<sup>M</sup>* ratio drops because there is relatively less additional supply of engineers than laborers as the agriculture sector contracts.

![](_page_10_Figure_book-ch4-v3_1.jpeg)

Figure 4.5: Labor Reallocation after Improving Terms of Trade

Meanwhile, the employment arrow in agriculture will turn *away* from the diagonal. Again, this is the only graphical way to restore full employment as the employment arrow for agriculture shrinks. The economic reason is that high-skilled workers are in particularly strong demand in the expanding and high skills intensive manufacturing sector. Therefore relatively more high-skilled engineers are attracted out of the agriculture sector than the farms used to employ. As many engineers move on to manufacturing but relatively fewer low-skilled workers get job offers in manufacturing, the farms end up with relatively more low-skilled laborers than before. In short, the farms reduce both engineering employment *H<sup>A</sup>* and laborer employment *LA*, but the *HA/L<sup>A</sup>* ratio drops on the farms, too, because engineers are in higher demand in the expanding sector and depart relatively more frequently.

The right panel of Figure 4.4 depicts the new equilibrium afterward. Once the two employment arrows have turned towards each other, they are tip-to-tip again in the new equilibrium. But both sectors' employment arrows are now flatter than before:

$$
\frac{H_A'}{L_A'}<\frac{H_A}{L_A}<\frac{H}{L}<\frac{H_M'}{L_M'}<\frac{H_M}{L_M},
$$

where a prime denotes employment after the terms of trade improvement. Note that one way to check whether you found a correct new equilibrium is to watch for the intersection of new and old employment arrows: the *new* employment arrow of the expanding sector must cut the *old* employment arrow of the shrinking sector exactly once. In other words, all sectors reduce their skill intensities simultaneously. How can this happen? Let's look at a related example.

Suppose there are only two businesses in the home economy: one avocado farm and one motorcycle production plant. The motorcycle plant employs six high-skilled engineers and three low-skilled laborers at a relative high-skill intensity of  $H_M/L_M = 2$ . The avocado farm employs three high-skilled engineers and six low-skilled laborers, at a relative high-skill intensity of  $H_A/L_A = 1/2$ . There is a fence between the motorcycle plant and the avocado farm. Then the terms of trade improve in the economy. As the motorcycle plant expands under the improving terms of trade, the fence moves right. With the newly occupied area, the motorcycle plant has to absorb a relatively large number of low-skilled laborers into its labor force. This scenario is depicted in the left panel of Figure 4.5.motorcycle gets to hire some laid off engineers but mostly laid off laborers since the avocado farm used to employ mostly laborers. Due to the addition of these low-skilled laborers, the motorcycle plant would then have to operate with a high-skill intensity of just  $H'_M/L'_M = 7/5$ , a severe drop down from the prior intensity of 2.

The motorcycle plant places a high value on high-skilled engineers, so at the old skill premium  $w_H/w_L$  the plant is willing to bid up the high-skill wage  $w_H$  and poach one additional engineer as the right panel of Figure 4.5 shows. This is where the poaching stops. In general, the poaching only stops when hiring an additional engineer increases the manufacturing plant's production value by less than the labor cost  $w_H^*$  of doing so, and when the shrinking avocado farm can afford to offer engineers a higher  $w_H^*$  to retain them. The farm is willing to pay a new higher wage to engineers because the low number of remaining engineers at the farm makes any retained engineer highly productive. Once the poaching and retention bidding is over, the motorcycle plant ends up with a high-skill intensity of  $H'_M/L'_M = 8/5$ , which is below its initial intensity (of 2). The avocado farm ends up with a high-skill intensity of  $H'_A/L'_A = 1/4$ , which is also below its initial intensity (of 1/2).The inevitable conclusion from this example, and our analysis of the Edgeworth box, is that the labor market will only get to a new equilibrium if all sectors end up with a relatively higher proportion of the scarce factor on their payroll. How can it be that both the agricultural sector and the manufacturing sector accept a lower high-skill intensity in the new equilibrium? In an equilibrium, every decision maker must be happy with his or her current choice. Under what factor-market condition does neither sector want to change its high-skill intensity? The answer is when the relative wage paid to the two types of workers has changed just enough. For an employer to demand relatively more low-skilled workers in the new equilibrium, their relative labor cost must have fallen. Put the other way, for an employer to be happy with a smaller proportion of high-skilled workers in the new equilibrium, the skill premium *wH/w<sup>L</sup>* must have gone up. Nice. Using the Edgeworth box, we have just proven a cornerstone proposition of classic trade theory called the Stolper–Samuelson theorem (Stolper and Samuelson 1941).

#### **Strong and Weak Forms of the Stolper–Samuelson Theorem**

In its weak form, the Stolper–Samuelson theorem states :

**Stolper–Samuelson Theorem (weak form).** In an economy with two sectors and two factors of production that are mobile between sectors, an increase in the domestic price of a product increases the *relative* income of the factor that is used relatively intensively in the production of that product.

In our factor-market analysis with the Edgeworth box, we started with an improvement of the terms of trade for the home economy, which led to an increase in the relative price of the manufactured product *PM/PA*. We found that, in the new factor-market equilibrium, both sectors must reduce their use of high-skilled workers.

Think about the avocado farm and motorcycle plant. After the rise in the price of motorcycles and an expansion of the motorcycle plant, the avocado farm employs fewer engineers and fewer laborers, whereas the motorcycle plant has more engineers and more laborers on its payroll. But both the avocado farm and the motorcycle plant have a higher percentage of laborers among their workers after the product price change. The motorcycle plant employs a larger share of laborers than it employed before, even though it wants to expand its engineering workforce relatively faster. The implication is that the wage paid to the laborers must fall relative to the wage paid to the engineers. Otherwise, the motorcycle plant would not hire so many laborers. The avocado farm dismisses a higher share of engineers than it used to employ, simply because engineers are in high demand at the motorcycle plant. The wage of the engineers must have gone up, otherwise the avocado farm would not lay off engineers at a higher frequency than it used to employ them.

Another way to look at the change in relative wages is to realize that the skill premium *wH/w<sup>L</sup>* must be driven by the additional labor demand in the expanding sector and the shortfall in labor demand in the shrinking sector. The additional labor demand in the expanding sector goes more than proportionally to the intensely used factor (high-skilled workers in our example), while the shortfall in labor demand affects mostly the intensely used factor (low-skilled workers in our example). Relatively more demand for the high-skilled workers in both sectors raises the skill premium. In other words, if the engineering-intensive sector expands with a product price shock, then the relative demand for engineers goes up, so the skill premium increases.

We can conclude that when a country's terms of trade improve, the abundant factor there gains in *relative* terms. What can we say about the real incomes, that is about *w<sup>H</sup>* relative to the product prices and about *w<sup>L</sup>* relative to the product prices? Things are good for the abundant factor, but bad for the relatively scarce factor. With some extra effort, one can establish the Stolper–Samuelson theorem in its strong form:

**Stolper–Samuelson Theorem (strong form).** In the Heckscher–Ohlin model with two countries, two sectors, and two factors that are mobile between sectors but not countries, if sectors differ in the intensity of their factor use, then an increase in the relative domestic price of the product with a comparative advantage unambiguously raises the *real* income of the country's relatively abundant factor and unambiguously reduces the *real* income of the country's relatively scarce factor of production.

It is the relatively abundant factor that is used relatively intensively in the production of the good with the comparative advantage. And it is the relatively scarce factor that is used relatively intensively in the production of the good with the comparative *dis*advantage.

The reason for this outcome is a so-called *magnification effect*, by which product price changes translate into even stronger factor price changes (Ronald W. Jones 1965). Let’s denote a percentage change in a product price or a factor price with a hat. For example,  $\hat{P}_M = .05$  means that  $P_M$  increases by 5 percent, or  $\hat{P}_A = 0$  means that  $P_A$  remains unchanged. Then:

$$
\hat{w}_H > \hat{P}_M > \hat{P}_A > \hat{w}_L.
$$

If the price of the manufactured good increases relatively more than the price of the agricultural good, then the factor that is intensively used in manufacturing experiences a wage increase that is stronger than the increase in both product prices. This is an improvement of the factor's real income, which in our example is the real income of the engineers. The consumption of all goods just became more affordable for them. Regardless of which sector a worker from the country's relatively abundant factor is employed, she gains in real terms. In contrast, the factor that is intensively used in agriculture sees less of a wage increase or a stronger fall than the price change in either product. The real income of the country's relatively scarce factor (low-skilled labor in our example) therefore declines because the *w<sup>L</sup>* wage now affords less consumption of both goods. Again, regardless of which sector a worker from the country's relatively scarce factor is employed, his real income declines.

#### **Trade-Induced Changes of Within-Country Inequality and Poverty**

The Stolper–Samuelson theorem shows that, when there is more than one factor of production, the overall gains from trade do not accrue equally to different skill groups in an economy. In the twosector and two-factor case, the relatively scarce factor loses in real terms. However, there are gains from trade for the economy as a whole when the economy specializes following its comparative advantage. The gains to the winners must therefore exceed the losses of the losers. The gains are merely unevenly distributed.

To distribute the gains from trade fairly, and achieve broad-based support for free trade, the country may need to institute safeguards such as compensating the losers or providing workers with training so they can enter skill-intensive occupations. One way to compensate potential losers from globalization is to create a safety net against employment and income loss through the welfare state. Indeed, more open economies tend to have bigger governments, perhaps so as to make globalization more acceptable to potential losers or perhaps because more open economies can afford bigger government.A way to help potential losers move on to better job opportunities is to offer them training for new skills. Since 1962, the United States government provides federal support under its *Trade Adjustment Assistance* program to trade displaced workers and to firms facing import competition: Displaced workers receive full-time training and qualify for a federal wage supplement in their subsequent job, while the assistance program for firms helps pay projects and consulting services to improve competitiveness. The effectiveness of these programs tends to be controversial, however. In a study of job displacements in the United States, Lori G. Kletzer (2001) documented that, when it comes to skills, age, and work experience, trade displaced workers are typically not different from workers who lose their job for other economic reasons such as technological change or shifts in product demand.

We observed at the outset of this chapter that within-country inequality is currently widening in some regions but narrowing elsewhere. We asked whether globalization can generate opposite consequences across regions. The Stolper–Samuelson theorem does indeed make this prediction. Suppose the high-skill wage exceeds the low-skill wage, *w<sup>H</sup> > wL*. Then the relatively high-skill abundant region will see the income disparity widen as the skill premium *wH/w<sup>L</sup>* increases. In contrast, the relatively low-skill abundant region will see income inequality narrow as the low-skill wage goes up and the skill premium *wH/w<sup>L</sup>* declines.

Poverty is conceptually distinct from inequality. A person is considered poor if her or his real income drops to a level that makes the basic means to participate in society unaffordable. Different governments and institutions adopt different definitions. The World Bank places the poverty line at an income of US\$1.25 a day and uses a purchasing power adjustment to make a dollar comparable across countries. According to the World Bank 2.9 billion people in 47 poor countries live below the poverty line, and 11.5 percent of these people, or 337 million, live in extreme poverty.<sup>6</sup> The right panel of Figure 4.6 plots the Gini index of a country's income inequality against the country's share of residents in extreme poverty for a sample of low- to middle-income countries. The Gini index is a widely used income inequality measure that lies between zero and one. It is larger when inequality is more extreme. The three countries with the highest extreme poverty rates are in Africa: They are the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia and Burundi. The four most unequal countries are in the Indian Ocean, Africa, and Latin America: They are the Seychelles, South Africa, Honduras, and Colombia.

Figure 4.6: Poverty and Inequality for a Sample of Low- to Middle-Income Countries

To see how free trade in final goods may affect poverty and inequality, let's suppose that the relatively abundant production factor in a poor country earns an income around the poverty level. The Stolper–Samuelson theorem in its weak form addresses inequality: if a country's relatively abundant production factor earns less income than the relatively scarce factor, then globalization will make the country more equitable with free trade. The Stolper–Samuelson theorem in its strong form deals with poverty: if a country's relatively abundant factor's income is at or below poverty level, then globalization will raise the factor's real income and may lift the factor out of poverty.

How do these predictions hold up in the data? The right panel of Figure 4.6 plots the change in the Gini inequality index against the change in the extreme poverty rate over the most recent decade, country by country. In the World Bank's sample of low- to middle-income countries, most observations lie in negative area of the lower-left quadrant where both inequality and poverty decline: These countries became more equitable and lifted residents out of poverty over the most recent decade. If these countries' poor are in a skill group that is relatively *abundant* compared to the countries' trade partners, then the Stolper–Samuelson theorem can provide an explanation. Similarly, for the countries in the upper-right quadrant where both inequality and poverty increase, the Stolper–Samuelson theorem offers an explanation if those countries' poor are in a skill group that is relatively *scarce* compared to the countries' trading partners. The fitted line has a positive slope and suggests that, on average, countries tend to fall in the lower-left and upper-right quadrants. The Stolper–Samuelson theorem seems to explain these outcomes well. However, there is also a substantial number of countries in the upper-left quadrant. Those economies face an increase in inequality while the poverty rate drops. The Stolper–Samuelson theorem cannot provide an explanation for those countries. Those countries' experience may either not have to do with globalization, but instead with structural or technological change, or may be due to other forms of globalization, beyond classic trade in final goods.<sup>7</sup>

<sup>7</sup>Upcoming chapters address offshoring and diverse firms, where some but not all employers offer high-wage jobs (Chapters 6 and 12), and go through candidate explanations for countries' experiences in the upper-left quadrant of the

Another way to assess the Stolper–Samuelson theorem is to look how support for globalization varies between political groups in society and over time. We should expect prospective losers from trade (the scarce factors) to oppose further globalization, while prospective winners (the abundant factors) should be supporters of trade integration. Great Britain did not engage in free trade at the start of the first global century, which lasted from around 1820 to 1913. Instead, the nation's Corn Laws, passed in 1815, imposed tariffs so high on grain that food imports were essentially shut out of Britain. The proposed repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 pitted the British owners of land against the British merchants and laborers, who supported the tariff cuts. These political positions were as the Stolper–Samuelson theorem predicts: Land was relatively more abundant among Britain's trade partners, the Americas and British colonies, so that landowners were the relatively scarce factor in Britain and therefore opponents of globalization. Free trade, however, was ultimately embraced following the repeal of the Corn Laws. In contrast, trade was widely opposed in the "new world", where the relatively scarce factors held the political majority. At the end of the 19th century, the United States was a comparably protectionist country with high tariffs on imports. The Stolper–Samuelson predicts for the Americas and British colonies that free trade would benefit landowners, because land was relatively abundant compared to the "old world." Laborers and merchants, who were relatively scarce factors in the Americas, would lose and free trade would worsen income inequality.

### **Think Twice about Convention:** *Declining Inequality among the Most Unequal*

In an influential study in 1994, Adrian Wood (1994) argued that so-called North-South trade between industrialized countries "in the North" and developing countries "in the South" had a far larger impact on labor markets than earlier studies had found. Wood argued that, in the industrialized economies of the North, especially in North America and Europe, globalization in the second half of the 20th century had depressed the relative demand for unskilled workers as the Heckscher–Ohlin trade theory predicts. In economies with flexible labor markets, such as in the United States, the skill premium consequently widened, and the real incomes of low-skilled workers suffered. In Western Europe, where labor markets are less flexible, wages fell by less, but unemployment went up. Wood (1994) called on Northern governments to take action, not through protectionism against free trade, but through education and training to increase the supply of skilled labor and reduce the skill premium.

A series of academic studies on individual countries has explored whether the Heckscher– Ohlin trade model really explains changing income inequality. Depending on the variant of the model you use, trade can explain a smaller or larger part of the inequality changes in the North. An important problem lies in the evidence for countries in the South. If the Stolper–Samuelson theorem for this model does indeed explain rising inequality in the North, then it also implies that there should have been declining inequality in the South. But Pinelopi K. Goldberg and Nina Pavcnik (2007) document in an extensive survey that inequality rose in the South, too, throughout the second half of the 20th century. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are among the most unequal in the world, and grew more unequal as they globalized further. Therefore, upon

right graph in Figure 4.6.

second thought, structural, technological and other changes, or other trade theories,may explain the inequality to a greater degree than the Heckscher–Ohlin model does.<sup>8</sup>

However, as the chapter opening noted, since the turn of this century, some of the most unequal economies in the South have been experiencing steady declines in inequality. Inequality has come down in Latin American countries with widely different per-capita growth rates, such as fast-growing Chile and Peru as well as slow-growing Brazil and Mexico. Income inequality fell in countries with large indigenous populations, such as Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru, and in countries with small indigenous populations, such as Argentina. In countries with widely varying inequality levels, such as highly unequal Brazil as well as less-unequal Argentina and Venezuela, the income gap has narrowed too. Luis F. Lopez-Calva and Nora Lustig (2010) present two main ´ explanations for the decline in inequality. (1) Hourly wages have become less unequal in these countries, and (2) government transfers programs, such as welfare, have raised the disposable incomes of low-income households. For example, Mexico's federal government created the social assistance program *Progresa* in 1997 and expanded it into the broader *Oportunidades* program since 2002. The objective is to alleviate poverty through conditional cash transfers: Poor families receive cash if they document that their children regularly attend school, that family members visit health clinics, and that young children receive nutritional supplements. Local mayors and governors in Brazil introduced similar programs in the late 1990s, which Brazil's federal government has folded into the national conditional cash transfer program *Bolsa Fam´ılia* since 2003, paying low-income households if their children attend school and receive vaccinations. An important part of these programs is that their components are made available to similar households in different regions at different times, so that the funding agencies can track the programs' effectiveness in raising school enrollment, improving health, and reducing poverty. The programs are widely regarded as successes.

As for the first explanation, Lopez-Calva and Lustig argue that the returns to schooling have ´ declined and shrunk the skill premium. Why? Some studies find that the skill premium fell because of an increase in the supply of more educated workers as school attendance rose. Other studies attribute the shrinking skill premium to a shift in demand away from skilled labor. When it comes to labor demand, , the Heckscher–Ohlin trade theory may indeed be a plausible explanation for why income inequality is declining in these countries if Latin American economies are relatively scarce in skilled labor.

#### **Trade-Induced Changes of Factor Intensities**

Changes in the political support for free trade and observed shifts in within-country inequality are two ways to check the Heckscher–Ohlin trade theory. There is a more direct test. The Edgeworth boxes showed you that after an economy opens up to trade, its factor intensities move in the same direction in all sectors of the economy. As globalization shifts a country's terms of trade in its favor, all sectors must increase the intensity of their use of the relatively scarce factor. For example, if Brazil is a relatively low-skill abundant country compared to its trading partners, then the Stolper– Samuelson theorem predicts that the skill premium will decline when the economy opens up to freer trade. In addition, all sectors in Brazil will more intensively employ highly-skilled workers because their relative wage falls (the skill premium they receive declines).

Brazil's federal government instituted large-scale trade reforms beginning in the late 1980s. The

government lowered import tariffs on some products around 1988, and then sharply reduced tariffs between 1990 and 1993. But the reform that had the biggest impact was the removal of trade restrictions that limited a long list of imported products. Those trade barriers were dropped by presidential decree in January 1990. Three years later, the share of manufacturing employment by firms exporting products from Brazil increased from 45 percent to 54 percent of the country's total manufacturing employment.

There are many industries in Brazil, so it is difficult to separate those that have a comparative advantage from those that have a comparative *dis*advantage. A way around this problem is to discern the economic activities carried out by the industries based on workers' occupations. In blue-collar occupations, workers perform production tasks, typically on factory floors. In white-collar occupations, workers perform organizational or design tasks, typically in offices.

Earlier in the chapter, using an Edgeworth box we depicted the size of a sector with the length of an employment arrow. Using this scheme, an arrow is now an occupation, and the slope of the arrow is the skill intensity of the occupation. We can measure the slope (the skill intensity) using years of schooling. The slope of the Edgeworth box's diagonal formerly reflected the skill endowment of the entire economy. Now we will measure the slope of the diagonal using the average amount of schooling of Brazil's workforce. Figure 4.7 shows five groups of occupations: unskilled bluecollar occupations, skilled blue-collar occupations, unskilled white-collar occupations, technical and supervisory occupations, and professional and managerial occupations. We can depict any two of these occupations in an Edgeworth box.

Year over year changes in the schooling for male workers by occupation compared to Brazil's population as a whole are shown in the left panel of Figure 4.7. The differences are negative for two low-skill intensive occupations (unskilled blue-collar jobs and skilled blue-collar occupations), slightly positive for the intermediate occupations (unskilled white-collar occupations), and strongly positive for the high-skill intensive occupations (technical and supervisory occupations and professional and managerial occupations). The advantage of taking the difference is that we remove the economy-wide differences in people's schooling in Brazil, which may change over time. That way, we do not confound the overall changing skill supply of labor in Brazil (changes in the shape of the Edgeworth box) with the labor demand effects from the Heckscher–Ohlin trade theory (changes of employment arrows inside the Edgeworth box).

After Brazil's trade reforms took full effect in 1990, the schooling level rose year after year in every single occupation—after subtracting the economy-wide average schooling. In other words, the workers in all occupations became more skilled. How can this happen? How can every occupation employ more skilled workers relative to average skill in the economy at the same time? The answer is: All of the employment arrows in the Edgeworth box change their slopes and lengths in the same direction in the right way. Concretely, employment in low-skill intensive occupations must have expanded so that every occupation ended up employing a larger share of highly schooled workers. Indeed, the right panel of Figure 4.7 shows that employment in skilled blue-collar occupations expanded substantively. Arguably, the economic activity in these skilled blue-collar occupations is where Brazil had a comparative advantage in the 1990s.

In summary, the workforce adjustment in Brazil's economy after the large-scale trade liberalization of 1990 is consistent with the predictions of the Heckscher–Ohlin trade theory. If Brazil has a comparative advantage in manufacturing industries that heavily rely on skilled blue-collar occupations, then employment in skilled blue-collar occupations expands (the Heckscher–Ohlin theorem). As a consequence, the skilled blue-collar occupations employ more workers with relatively little schooling. So the demand for workers with relatively little schooling increases and the skill premium falls (the Stolper–Samuelson theorem). As the skill premium declines, all occupations end up employing a larger proportion of workers with relatively much schooling.

### **4.3 Migration and the Rybczynski Theorem**

The trade of goods is as globalized today as it ever was. The world is less globalized when it comes to migration, however. The share of foreign-born residents in large countries of the "new world" is lower than it used to be a century ago, though there are more migrants in "old" Europe than there used to be.<sup>9</sup> What is the consequence of migration in a globalized world with free trade in goods? How does the skill premium change, what happens to employment, and which economic activities shrink or expand?

An important insight of our Edgeworth box analysis is that under changing terms of trade, factor prices change only if product prices change. If product prices do not change, then the slopes of the employment arrows do not change. Unchanged slopes mean constant factor intensities, and employers are only happy with the same factor intensities in equilibrium if they face the same skill premium. In other words, as long as both countries make a little of both goods so that both employment arrows have positive lengths (as long as there is so-called incomplete specialization), then factor prices change only if product prices change. In short, for given product prices, relative factor prices do not change once countries trade.<sup>10</sup>

With that insight in place, the answers to the questions about migration are brief and stunning. In the early 1950s, Tadeusz M. Rybczynski, a graduate student at the London School of Economics and Political Science, first worked out the consequences of migration in the Heckscher–Ohlin model when final goods markets are perfectly integrated . While his result became famous in the academic world as the **Rybczynski theorem**, he went on to become an investment banker in London.

Figure 4.8: Increase in Labor Endowment under Free Final Goods Trade

**Rybczynski Theorem.** Suppose there are two sectors, two countries, and two factors that are mobile between sectors but not countries, and the sectors differ in terms of their factor intensities whereas the countries differ in terms of their factor abundance. If the endowment of one factor increases, then the output of the sector that relatively intensely uses the factor expands, and the output of the other sector contracts under free final-goods trade and incomplete specialization. Product prices, factor prices and factor intensities remain unchanged.

Essentially the Rybczynski theorem tells us that migration doesn't affect factor prices and the proportions of factor inputs. It merely changes the location of production. But that does not change the income the factors earn because the final goods still sell at the same prices worldwide, and the factor prices also remain the same. The sector that intensely uses the migrating factor will shrink in the country from which the factor migrated and expand in the country to which the factor migrated.

### **Migration and the Proof of the Rybczynski Theorem**

The proof of the Rybczynski theorem is intuitive. Figure 4.8 shows the graphical derivation when low-skilled labor migrates. The upper panel is an Edgeworth box for the home economy with the factor-market in equilibrium when final goods are being freely traded. The shape of the Edgeworth box reflects relative factor abundance (the country characteristic). A relatively wide Edgeworth box (a flatter diagonal in the home country than in the foreign country) means that the home country is relatively abundant in the *L* factor (on the horizontal axis). The relevant sector feature in the Heckscher–Ohlin model is the relative intensity of the use of a factor. It is reflected in the slope of each sector’s employment arrow.

Consider the blue arrow. The blue arrow starts out at the origin of agriculture in the lower-left corner of the Edgeworth box. The blue arrow's slope is equal to the employment proportion of highskilled labor relative to low-skilled labor *HA/L<sup>A</sup>* in agriculture, and the arrow's length is proportional to the sector's output. Now consider the red arrow, which starts at the origin of manufacturing in the upper-right corner of the Edgeworth box (you can also turn around this page by 180 degrees and think of the manufacturing sector as the one at the origin). The red arrow's slope is equal to the employment of high- relative to low-skilled labor *HM/L<sup>M</sup>* in manufacturing, and the red arrow's length is proportional to the manufacturing output in the home economy. The two arrows point tip to tip because both factors are fully employed in equilibrium. Both sectors employ factors at their optimal skill intensities under the prevailing skill premium *wH/wL*. The blue arrow is flatter than the red arrow. Why? By our convention, agriculture is relatively low-skill intensive, so *HM/L<sup>M</sup> > HA/L<sup>A</sup>* (no matter what the skill premium *wH/w<sup>L</sup>* is).

Recall that an important insight of the Heckscher–Ohlin model is that for a given product price ratio  $P_A/P_M$  under free final-goods trade, the skill premium  $w_H/w_L$  is fixed, too, as long as both countries make a little of both goods. In other words, product-market conditions directly translate into factor-market conditions. Therefore, the optimal intensities of factor inputs  $H_A/L_A$  and  $H_M/L_M$  are constant for each sector as long as  $P_A/P_M$  does not change.

Now consider what happens when low-skilled labor migrates from abroad to the home economy. Let's start with the Edgeworth box's frame. The frame expands horizontally as depicted in the lower panel of Figure 4.8, but the height of the box remains unaltered. How do the employment arrows change? Take their slopes. With product prices under free trade given, factor prices cannot change as long as both countries make a little of both goods—regardless of migration. So, the intensities of the factors  $H_A/L_A$  and  $H_M/L_M$  remain the same. As a result, the slopes of the blue and the red arrows stay the same as before migration (the arrows in the lower panel of Figure 4.8 are parallel to the arrows in the upper panel of Figure 4.8). The red arrow must start out in the origin of the manufacturing sector, so it moves with the frame and shifts to its new position while retaining its old slope. So much for the slopes. Now to the sizes of the employment arrows.

In the new factor-market equilibrium under free final-goods trade and after migration, the employment arrows must again point tip-to-tip. The only way this can happen under constant slopes is if the blue arrow of the agricultural sector gets longer, and the red arrow gets shorter. Use your ruler to try any alternative, and convince yourself that no other possibility works. This proves the Rybczynski theorem: An increase in the endowment of the *L* factor increases the output of the sector that relatively intensely uses this factor and reduces output in the other sector.

The Rybczynski theorem can also be expressed in terms of a *magnification effect*. Endowment changes translate into magnified output changes. Let's denote a percentage change in an endowment or an output with a hat. For example,  $\hat{Q}_A = .05$  means that agricultural output increases by 5 percent. Likewise,  $\hat{H} = 0$  means that the high-skill endowment  $H$  remains unchanged. Then:

$$
\hat{Q}_A > \hat{L} > \hat{H} > \hat{Q}_M.
$$

If the low-skill endowment *L* increases relatively more than the high-skill endowment *H*, then the output  $Q_A$  in the sector that intensively uses low-skilled labor (agriculture by our convention) changes more strongly than either endowment change. If *L* increases under low-skill migration, but *H* does not ( $\hat{H} = 0$ ), then agricultural output expands strongly. The blue employment arrow therefore expands more than the horizontal extension of the Edgeworth frame. In contrast, output in the sectorthat intensively uses the factor with the smaller endowment increase changes less than either endowment. If *H* does not change ( $\hat{H} = 0$ ), but *L* increases under low-skill migration, then manufacturing output contracts, and the red employment arrow shrinks.The Rybczynski theorem makes two important predictions about migration. First, if globalization already involves the trade of final goods then migration does not affect the factor incomes. Second, the sector that relatively intensely uses the migrating factor shrinks in the migrants' country of origin and partly relocates to the migrant-receiving country. The other sector relocates in the reverse direction. Since goods prices do not change with migration, then the real incomes and consumption of the people in the two economies do not change with migration. Is this realistic?

#### **Migration and Factor Incomes: What's the Evidence?**

Political discussions of migration frequently revolve around its consequences for employment and income inequality. The main flows of migrants today to industrialized countries originate in the developing world. These migrants arrive in their host countries with relatively low education levels and presumably compete for jobs held by low-skilled native workers. The Rybczynski theorem, in contrast, suggests that the competition of migrants for low-skilled jobs has little consequence when product markets are extremely globalized.

Much academic evidence on this issue comes from studies that compare regions of a country by their number of immigrants and assume that the regions behave like distinct economies. Most of those studies find that immigration has little impact on either wages or employment, just as the Rybczynski theorem predicts (see for example a survey study by Simonetta Longhi, Peter Nijkamp and Jacques Poot 2008).

There is some academic evidence that migration expands the output of sectors that intensively use the migrants' predominant skills, also like the Rybczynski theorem predicts. Research on U.S. agriculture production in the early 20th century is an example. Jeanne Lafortune, Jose Tessada and ´ Carolina Gonzalez-Velosa (2013) document that during that timeframe, wheat production, which is ´ not a labor-intensive crop, declined because more farmers were added per acre of land as a result of migration .

David Card (2009) cautions, however, that properly grouping workers by their skills is important: College graduates are the high-skilled and have economically distinct skills from less-educated workers, including college dropouts, who should be classified as low-skilled together with highschool graduates and dropouts. When workers are grouped this way, Card finds that low-skilled immigrants did reduce the wages of the low-skilled American workers in 124 U.S. metropolitan areas, in contrast with the Rybczynski prediction. However, Card also argues that immigration has had little impact on U.S. wages overall because the average immigrant to the United States has skills that are in fact quite similar to the typical U.S. native. In other countries, the evidence is more in line with the Rybczynski theorem, even after proper grouping. Christian Dustmann and Albrecht Glitz (2012) document for Germany, for example, that the wages of workers in sectors in which goods are traded haven't been affected by the changing mix of skills in the labor force as a result of immigration.

The Heckscher–Ohlin model is based on the assumption that technologies do not differ across countries and do not change with locally available skills. Ethan Lewis (2011) shows in a comprehensive study that, over the past three decades, U.S. manufacturing plants invested heavily in automated machinery, and these investments happened mostly in metropolitan areas that did not receive much immigration of low-skilled labor. In other words, employers in locations where low-skilled labor is relatively scarce because there is not much immigration, tend to put more automation technology in place to perform the low-skill tasks. An interesting implication of this finding is that immigration might only have a small impact on wages not necessarily because the Rybczynski theorem is the best explanation, but because the capital cost of investing in automated machinery is relatively constant and that keeps the wages of low-skilled workers largely unchanged in firms that don't automate.

### **Change of Perspective:** *Dear Swedes, Please Migrate or Trade*

About 55 million Europeans migrated to North and South America and Australia (Timothy J. Hatton and Jeffrey G. Williamson 1998) between 1850 and 1914. The Swedish economist Knut Wicksell welcomed the mass emigration of his fellow Swedes. Wicksell thought that emigration from the Swedish countryside would end rural poverty in the country. He predicted that the departure of low-skilled workers would provide them with better incomes at the new destinations. At these new destinations the low-skilled Swedish workers were relatively scarce compared to the abundant amount of land there. Consequently, they would receive high wages, while their left-behind former co-workers with low skills would also see their wages rise as the pool of lowskilled workers shrank in Sweden. Sounds good, doesn't it?

As the last large wave of Swedish workers left the country in 1907, Swedish landowners feared that Wicksell's prediction was coming true. The landowners were so worried they launched a large public investigation, overseen by a newly formed emigration commission *Emigrationsutredningen* from 1907 to 1913. The commission's report related transatlantic emigration to the scarcity of manpower in Swedish agrarian production. Hatton and Williamson (1998) confirm Wicksell's prediction for incomes, though mostly for the urban poor: Emigration between 1870 and 1910 raised Swedish farm wages by 12 percent, whereas urban unskilled wages in Sweden almost doubled over the four decades. Wicksell was right. Migrants raised their living standards in the countries to which they emigrated. As the low-skilled migrants arrived, they made the locally abundant resources such as high-skilled labor, land, and capital more productive and attained a high living standard themselves. And in the countries from which the workers emigrated, their poor former co-workers became scarcer and thus also richer.

In 1919, short before Christmas, Eli Heckscher sent to Knut Wicksell the manuscript *The Effect of Foreign Trade on the Distribution of Income* and wrote in the accompanying letter: "I am afraid this Christmas gift is not very welcome" (quoted in Lars Herlitz 2002). The Christmas gift contained an insight that would, in fact, become the Heckscher–Ohlin trade model: Free trade, as Heckscher conceived at the time and Ohlin (1924) elaborated, would tend to equalize factor prices. In other words, wages would tend to converge around the world as the globalization of final goods trade progressed. Heckscher's argument means that the trade of final goods is a perfect economic alternative to labor migration.<sup>11</sup>

Migration and trade move wages in the same direction. Freer trader makes wages go up in the "old world" where low-skilled labor is relatively abundant (the Stolper–Samuelson theorem). Alternatively, emigration increases the incomes of low-skilled workers by making the left-behind workforce scarcer. Meanwhile, trade makes wages move down in the "new world" where lowskilled labor is relatively scarce because trade depresses the wage (the Stolper–Samuelson theorem). Alternatively, immigration reduces the wage by making low-skilled labor less scarce. A heated academic exchange followed between Heckscher and Wicksell in the 1919 issue of the *Swedish Economic Journal*. Wicksell and Heckscher clashed about the consequences of trade for another important Swedish sector at the time: forestry and with it wood and lumber manufacturing, also relatively low-skill intensive activities. Heckscher foresaw rising prices for wood, a product in which he argued Sweden had a comparative advantage. Wicksell predicted that Swedish workers would emigrate; Heckscher emphasized instead that the Swedish wood industry would expand. In an article about the episode, Herlitz (2002, p. 479) explains that behind the clash was Wicksell's "much weaker confidence in laissez-faire and free trade, . . . his emphasis on the scarcity of land and forests, and his underrating of the development prospects of Swedish industry."

Heckscher's theory might have been an even less welcome Christmas gift to Swedish landowners who feared there would be a scarcity of manpower in agriculture. According to Heckscher's argument, free trade would result in a similar prospect for landowners even if emigration stopped: Labor costs on Swedish farms would go up with free trade just as if migrants kept departing.

### **4.4 Curved Production Possibilities and Incomplete Specialization**

In Ricardian trade theory, the production possibility frontier (PPF) for two sectors is a straight line. Among other consequences, Ricardian trade therefore results in **complete specialization**: Every sector produces in only one location under free trade. In classic trade theory with more than one factor of production, in contrast, the PPF is belly shaped. Among other implications, the curved PPF results in **incomplete specialization**: A country's export sector produces relatively more output than the world average, and the country's import-competing sector produces relatively less than the world average, but each sector typically produces in both locations under free trade. To understand why production possibilities are curved when there are constant returns to scale but more than two factors of production, think back to the Edgeworth box (for example the one in Figure 4.4). A change in a country's production mix on the PPF means that one sector must shrink while the other expands. As one sector lays off workers and shrinks, it dismisses relatively more workers from one skill group than the other sector currently employs. Conversely, as a sector expands, its factor intensity must change because it cannot attract additional employment given the old skill composition from the shrinking sector. This means the output in the expanding sector must rise less than proportionally. Why? Recall that constant returns to scale imply that when a sector doubles both factor inputs, then output doubles. When the sector triples both factor inputs, then output triples, and so on. However, when the sector doubles only one factor input and less than doubles the other input, then output less than doubles, and so on. Therefore, if sectors differ in their relative uses of production factors, contracting one sector's output does not expand the other sector's output at a constant rate. The expanding sector ends up with a higher proportion of the factor that the sector does not want to use intensively, so production in the expanding sector increases less than proportionally and the PPF becomes a curve.

The left panel of Figure 4.9 shows the resulting curved PPF in a diagram with output from the manufacturing and agricultural sectors in the home economy. The two black dots on the axes show

<sup>10</sup>In 1924, Ohlin does not yet refer to factor price equality; he merely posits a tendency for factor prices to converge. As you will see in the upcoming Chapter 5, the Heckscher–Ohlin trade model, when worked out fully, in fact implies that factor prices are identical in all economies if technology is the same around the world.

Figure 4.9: Curved Production Possibilities

points of complete specialization. At the black dot on the horizontal axis, the home economy devotes all of its resources to manufacturing. At the black dot on the vertical axis, the economy devotes all of its resources to agriculture. As the economy shifts resources between the two extremes, while maintaining full employment in the Edgeworth box in the background, it moves along the PPF. Any point on the PPF shows a feasible production mix of agricultural and manufacturing output. The diagram in the left panel of Figure 4.9 depicts two possible product mixes on the PPF with black dots. For each of the two black dots in the PPF, we can read the production mix  $Q_A/Q_M$  off from the slope of the ray between the origin and the production point on the PPF.As before, the slope of the PPF at any point reflects the opportunity cost of the manufactured product (the good on the horizontal axis) in terms of the foregone output of the agricultural good (the good on the vertical axis). As we move slightly to the right and the economy makes one extra unit of the manufactured product, we have to sacrifice *PM/P<sup>A</sup>* units of the agricultural product, where *PM/P<sup>A</sup>* is the relative price of manufactures in autarky. The further to the right we move, the higher the opportunity cost gets. Recall that a sector is particularly productive in the factor that it uses relatively intensively. The relatively strong production boost that a sector gets from the intensively used factor is precisely what makes the sector so intensive in that factor. As one sector expands, the shrinking sector lays off relatively more workers in the skill group that the expanding sector does not use intensively, and the expanding sector's production does not increase proportionally.

#### **Incomplete Specialization**

The right panel of Figure 4.9 shows the equilibrium with free world trade. The steps to find the free trade equilibrium are similar to the steps we used to find the equilibrium in the Ricardian model. Initially we only know the slope of the green terms-of-trade line, and there are many possible positions of the line as depicted at the upper-right end of the diagram. To position the terms-of-trade line, we need to shift it inwards (for example using a ruler and keeping it at an angle with exactly the slope of the terms of trade) until it just touches the home country's PPF. The point of tangency with the PPF is the production sector's optimal product mix. None of the dashed green lines to the far upper right are at a position that is affordable for the home economy. Should we lower the terms-of- trade line any further than the point of tangency? We had better not because at the point of tangency the home economy's consumers can afford consumption on the green line and any line at a lower level would mean less to consume. Consumers can exchange manufacturing exports for agricultural products, and vice versa, moving up or down along the green international trade line as they please. Note that the black dot, which depicts the optimal production mix of the economy under the given terms of trade, now occurs at an interior point where the economy produces a little of both goods. The exact production mix *QA/Q<sup>M</sup>* is the slope of the ray between the origin and the black production point on the PPF and it is positive and finite. In other words, the economy specializes incompletely.

How do we find the exact consumption choice? A consumption ray from the origin does the trick. For a given world price ratio *PM/PA*, the consumption ray reflects a reasonable consumer's optimal consumption choices. With expanding real income, consumers demand more of both goods but in a fixed proportion.<sup>11</sup> The green dot, where the consumption ray crosses the terms of trade line, is the optimal consumption choice of these consumers. It is to the left and up from the black production point. In the example of the right panel of Figure 4.9, the slope of the consumption ray is therefore steeper than the slope of the production ray. That means home consumers demand relatively more agricultural consumption than the home economy's production sector supplies; the difference is imported agricultural produce. Conversely, home consumers demand relatively less manufacturing consumption than the home economy's production sector supplies; the difference is exported manufactures. The red trade triangle shows the country's manufacturing exports along the horizontal dimension and the country's agricultural imports along the vertical dimension. The value of the exports equals the value of the imports at any point on the green line, so trade is balanced.

The world trade equilibrium results in incomplete specialization. We can infer from Figure 4.9 that the home country's export sector produces relatively more output than the world average, and the home country's import-competing sector produces relatively less than the world average. However, both sectors actively produce under free trade.

There are clear gains from trade. The area below the green terms-of-trade line and above the PPF shows all the consumption mixes the home country can afford with free trade but that were not affordable in autarky. The fundamental source of the gains from trade is the separation of the consumption decision (the green dot) and the production decision (the black dot). However, as we saw in our earlier analysis of the Edgeworth box, gains from trade are not necessarily distributed equitably within the economy: Only the relatively abundant factor gains from free trade in the Heckscher– Ohlin model, and the relatively scarce factor is worse off than it was when the economy was in autarky.

#### **Improving Terms of Trade, Production and Consumption Choices**

What happens when there is incomplete specialization and the terms of trade improve? If the home country is an exporter of manufactured products, then its terms of trade are

$$
ToT = P_{\text{Expert good}}/P_{\text{Import good}} = P_M/P_A.
$$

The left panel of Figure 4.10 depicts the initial equilibrium. Then the terms of trade improve. That is the relative price of manufactured goods *PM/P<sup>A</sup>* increases. As a result the terms-of-trade line

<sup>11</sup>For the microeconomist: The ray reflects so-called homothetic preferences. An example is the Cobb-Douglas utility function that results in a consumption ray *Q d A/Q<sup>d</sup> <sup>M</sup>* = (*βA/βM*)*PM/P<sup>A</sup>* for the utility parameters *β<sup>A</sup>* and *βM*, which reflect the responsiveness of utility with respect to the consumption of *Q<sup>A</sup>* and *QM*. At any given relative price *PM/PA*, the consumption ray has a fixed slope (*βA/βM*)*PM/PA*, but the ray turns upwards when *PM/P<sup>A</sup>* increases.

![](_page_26_Figure_book-ch4-v3_1.jpeg)

Figure 4.10: Production and Consumptions After Improving Terms of Trade

becomes steeper as the right panel of Figure 4.10 shows.

What is the new production mix of products? As before, the optimal production mix is at the point of tangency between the terms-of-trade line and the PPF, as the new black dot in the right panel of Figure 4.10 indicates. How do we find the economy's new consumption choices? Consumers want to place a smaller fraction of manufactured goods in their consumption baskets when the relative price of the good rises. The consumption ray therefore turns up as households consume a larger proportion of the agricultural goods per manufactured good. The intersection of the new (solid black) consumption ray with the new (solid green) terms of trade line is the new consumption choice after the terms-of-trade improvement (at the new green dot). Consumers are clearly better off at this new point than at the old consumption point (where the dotted green old terms-of-trade line and the dotted black old consumption ray intersect). The old consumption point is still affordable with the new terms-of-trade line, but consumers switch to newly affordable consumption. Consequently, the average consumer in the economy must be better off. However, the additional gains from trade are not equitably distributed as we saw before in the Edgeworth box. The Stolper–Samuelson theorem tells us that the relatively abundant production factor gains while the relatively scarce factor loses.

### **4.5 The Heckscher–Ohlin Model and the Gravity Equation**

Recall from Chapter 3 that the gravity equation of international trade is a good predictor of trade flows. To predict trade flows, the gravity equation takes into account the total production of the good in the source country, the amount a destination country spends on the good, and the distance between the two countries. Any useful trade theory should be consistent with the gravity equation. The Heckscher-Ohlin model shares one crucial feature with all other classic trade models (such as the earlier Ricardian model and the Ricardo–Viner model, which we discuss in the next Chapter 5): Final goods are indistinguishable from each other regardless of the countries from which they originate.<sup>12</sup> In the absence of trade costs, such as transportation costs, for example, the law of one price holds.

<sup>12</sup>For the microeconomist: Indistinguishable goods are also called homogeneous goods. We will drop that assumption in Part II.

The law of one price states that every product *i* sells at the same price  $P_i$  in every country. Because of the law of one price and the fact that the products are indistinguishable from one another producers are indifferent about the destination countries where they sell. Likewise, consumers are indifferent about the countries from which they can purchase them.What does the indifference of producers and consumers between destination and source countries mean for a good's trade flows? Alan V. Deardorff (1998) proposed that we can treat the supply of a good as the amount of it that the world's producers contribute to a “global pool” of the good. A consumer then reaches into the global supply pool of the good, and randomly picks the number of identically priced and indistinguishable units he or she can afford. What is the chance the consumer will pick a unit of the good from one particular source country? A source country's chance that its good will be sampled by a global consumer is proportional to the production share  $\gamma_{is}$  of the source country  $s$  in the pool:

$$
\gamma_{Si} \equiv \frac{Q_{Si}}{\sum_{C} Q_{Ci}} = \frac{Y_{Si}}{Y_{i}^{W}}.
$$

For example, if country *S*'s contribution of avocados *i* to the world supply of avocados is *YSi* = 100 avocados, and the global supply of avocados *Y <sup>W</sup> <sup>i</sup>* = ∑ *C YCi* = 1*,* 000, then country *S*'s share in the global avocado pool is *γSi* = *.*1 or 10 percent. *QSi* is the quantity of good *i* that source country *S* contributes to the global pool, and ∑ *<sup>C</sup> QCi* is the overall size of the pool. Since the law of one price holds, that is since *P<sup>i</sup>* is the same everywhere in the world, we can multiply the quantity in the numerator and the quantities in the denominator of *γSi* by the product price *P<sup>i</sup>* and find an equivalent expression for *γSi* = *YSi/Y <sup>W</sup> i* , where *YiS* is sector *i*'s output in source country *S* and *Y <sup>W</sup> <sup>i</sup>* = ∑ *C YCi* is global output of the good.

In the Heckscher–Ohlin model with two countries, two sectors and two production factors, a country produces a more than proportional amount of good *i* ( $\gamma_{Si} > 1/2$ ) in a sector *i* that relatively intensively uses the production factor that is relatively abundant in country *S*.Under our standard consumer preferences, the expenditure on a good  $i$  by consumers in the destination country  $D$  is
$$
Y_{Di} = \beta_i \cdot Y_D,
$$

**Fundamentals.**

- *• Key force*: **Differences in factor intensities** *and* **endowments** (identical sector technologies across countries)
- *•* Factors of production: 2 (high-skilled *H* and low-skilled *L*)
- *•* Factor mobility: Each factor mobile between sectors, immobile across borders
- *•* Sectors (goods): 2. Agriculture *Q<sup>A</sup>* and Manufacturing *QM*; *Q<sup>i</sup>* made with *H<sup>i</sup>* and *Li*
- *•* Production stages: 1 single final stage
- *•* Countries: 2 (Home and rest of world Foreign*∗* )
- *•* Perfect competition, transport costs: **Freight factor** *dSD* = *dSd<sup>D</sup>*
- *•* Constant returns to scale
- *•* Balanced trade
- *•* Contracts perfectly enforceable

where  $Y_D$  is the destination country *D*'s national income and  $\beta_i$  is the country's share of expenditures on good *i*. For example, if avocados have an expenditure share  $\beta_A$  of twenty percent, then a household with one thousand dollars of income will spend \$200 dollars on avocados. Constant expenditure shares  $\beta_i$  imply that the value of good *i* shipments from source country *S* to destination *D*must be

$$
X_{SDi} = \gamma_{Si} Y_{Di} = \gamma_{Si} \beta_i Y_D.
$$

Now we can replace with  $\gamma_{Si} = Y_{Si}/Y_i^W$  in the equation, and arrive at the following version of the gravity equation:
$$
X_{SDi} = B_i Y_{Si} Y_D
$$

for the constant *B<sup>i</sup>* = *βi/Y <sup>W</sup> i* . The equation tells us that the export flow *XSDi* from a source country *S* to a destination country *D* will be large if the production value generated by industry *i* in the source country (GDP*Si*) is big and pushes a sizeable amount of exports onto the world market, and the trade flow to a destination country will be large if the destination country has a large national income (*YD*). The constant *B<sup>i</sup>* captures other aspects that affect the trade volume.

There is no distance term in this version of the gravity equation because we assumed there were no transport costs. However, when there are transport costs, the price of the product at its final destination is usually different from the price when the good leaves the producer's factory gate, and the law of one price typically fails.

It can be hard to figure out the role transport costs (the freight factor) play when there is incomplete specialization like there is in the Heckscher–Ohlin model. To keep matters simple, suppose shipping from the source country to the global supply pool costs a freight factor of *dS*. This scales the factory gate price of the product up by a factor of *d<sup>S</sup>* percent. So if product *i* costs a dollar at the factory gate, and the freight factor *d<sup>S</sup>* is 110 percent, then the good costs 1 *· d<sup>S</sup>* = 1*.*10 dollars when placed in the supply pool. Suppose that, to withdraw a good from the supply pool, a consumer has to pay another freight factor *d<sup>D</sup>* so that the total freight factor from supplier to final customer is *dSD* = *dSdD*. For example, if it costs another ten percent to ship from the supply pool to the final destination, then the good costs the final consumer 1 *· dSd<sup>D</sup>* = 1*.*21 dollars. Overall, the price of the same good *i* in supply *YSi* at the factory gate is smaller by a freight factor of *dSD* than the price at its destination *YD*. We can divide *Y<sup>D</sup>* in the gravity equation by the freight factor to make the production values in the source country comparable to the consumption values at the destination comparable:

$$
X_{SDi} = B_i Y_{Si} \frac{Y_D}{d_{SD}}.
$$

The Hechscher–Ohlin model delivers the gravity equation.

### **A Test of the Heckscher–Ohlin Model Using the Gravity-Based Comparative Advantage (GCA) Measure**

We now have everything in place to subject the Heckscher–Ohlin model to a final test. Does the interaction of endowments (the country characteristics) with factor intensities (the sector characteristics) explain an economy's comparative advantage? We have two measures of comparative advantage. First, we have the Balassa measure of Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA), which summarizes the relative export specialization of a sector:

$$
RCA_i^{\text{Country}} \equiv \frac{X_i^{\text{Country}} / \sum_k X_k^{\text{Country}}}{X_i^{\text{World}} / \sum_k X_k^{\text{World}}}.
$$

The RCA is found by dividing the share of a sector's exports in a given country by the country's total exports, and then dividing the sector's worldwide exports by total exports worldwide. The revealed comparative advantage measure equals 1 if the sector's trade share in a country is identical to that in the rest of the world.

Second, we can extract *YSi* from the estimated gravity equation for all countries and define the *gravity-based* comparative advantage measure (GCA) as

$$
GCA_i^{\text{Country }S} \equiv \frac{\frac{Y_{Si}}{\sum_k Y_{Sk}}}{\frac{\sum_C Y_{Ci}}{\sum_C \sum_k Y_{Ck}}}.
$$

The upside of the GCA measure is that it removes the effect geography has on the revealed comparative advantage: Gravity estimation purges the trade flow component  $Y_{Si}$  of destination market's size and distance.Let's test how well the Heckscher–Ohlin model explains comparative advantage. To find a suitable predictor of comparative advantage, we need to combine an industry's skill intensity with a country's skill endowment. As a measure of an industry's skill intensity we can use the proportion of non-production workers in offices relative to production workers on the shop floor in the United States, like in the examples at the beginning of this chapter. As a measure of a country's relative skill abundance we can use the average years of schooling of a country's population relative to the United States. Then we need to combine the industry characteristics with the country characteristics. One solution is to simply multiply the two measures, that is to "interact" them as the econometricians say. Ready for the test. How do *RCA* and *GCA* relate to the interaction of the industries' skill intensity with the countries' skill abundance?

The left panel of Figure 4.11 plots the Balassa RCA measure against the industry-country skill intensity-abundance interaction, and the right panel plots the GCA measure against the interaction. The association between GCA and the intensity-abundance interaction is a bit closer than the association between the RCA and the interaction is.<sup>13</sup> But there is considerable dispersion of comparative advantage around the fitted line. One reason for this dispersion is that differences in technology also matter for comparative advantage, as you already know from the Ricardian model in previous chapters. The GCA data points are less dispersed than the RCA data points are because the GCA measure removes the "lucky" gravity effects industries experience by being nearby attractive destination markets. In both panels of Figure 4.11, the line through the points shows that there is a clear positive relationship between comparative advantage and the key explanatory variable of the Heckscher–Ohlin model. A relatively skill intensive industry in a relatively skill abundant country commands a revealed comparative advantage in terms of its exports.

### **Summary**

The Heckscher–Ohlin trade model offers a novel explanation for the origins of globalization. If sectors use identical technologies everywhere in the world, perhaps because production knowledge has spread globally, then the Ricardian explanation for trade based on technology is less valuable and might even be brushed aside. What alternative force can generate comparative advantage? Country characteristics and sector characteristics. The combination of the country characteristics (differences

<sup>13</sup>The ordinary least squares slope coefficient in the regression of RCA on the intensity-abundance interaction is .11 and statistically significantly different from zero at the five-percent level of significance, whereas the slope coefficient in the regression of GCA on the intensity-abundance interaction is .15 and statistically significantly different from zero at the one-percent significance level. (The GCA measure is a generated regressor so the assessment of statistical significance should be more elaborate but is beyond the scope of this textbook.)

in relative factor endowments) and the sector characteristics (differences in relative factor uses) constitutes a new force for trade and gives a new answer to our first theme question *why is there globalization?* When a country's sector intensively uses the country's abundant factor then the sector has a comparative advantage.

It is then a short step to an answer for the second theme *how globalization happens*. According to the Heckscher–Ohlin theorem, a country exports the good that intensively uses the country's abundant factor in production and imports the good that intensively uses the country's scarce factor in production. In contrast, in the Ricardian model the sources of opportunity cost differences and therefore the trade patterns were sector-specific *and* country-specific technologies that yield a certain labor productivity.

The third theme asks, *should there be globalization?* From an economist's analytic perspective, the answer is still a clear yes. If every economy specializes according to its comparative advantage, then the average resident in every country will be better off with trade. But individual residents are not the average resident, and the Stolper–Samuelson theorem for the Heckscher–Ohlin model in its strong form predicts that a worker's answer to the question *should there be globalization?* will depend on the worker's skill group. Regardless of the sector of employment, workers that have a country's relatively abundant skills will receive higher real incomes when the economy opens to free trade. Workers with the relatively abundant skill will therefore support globalization. However, workers that have the country's relatively scarce skill will suffer a drop in real incomes from free trade and therefore oppose globalization, no matter which sector employs them. Since the average resident is better off, the winners from globalization can fully compensate the losers, for example through government programs, receive the scarce factor's support for globalization, and secure the gains from globalization. Market forces alone will not equitably distribute the gains from trade, but it is still advantageous for the country to globalize.

| Endowment                 | The given amount of a factor of production in an economy. The home country is relatively abundant in factor H (in terms of L) if $$\frac{H}{L} > \frac{H^*}{L^*}$$. Conversely, factor H is relatively scarce if $$\frac{H}{L} < \frac{H^*}{L^*}\,. $$                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Intensity                 | The relative demand for a factor by a sector. Sector $$i$$ uses factor H relative to factor L more intensively than sector $$x$$ if $$\frac{H_i}{L_i} > \frac{H_x}{L_x}$$ for any given skill-premium ratio $$\frac{w_H}{w_L}\,. $$                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Factor price              | The payment for the services of a factor of production per unit. Examples include:<br>• Wage of labor<br>• Rental price of arable land<br>• Rental price of physical capital<br>*(Factor income = factor price × quantity of factor employed.)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Skill premium             | The ratio of one skill group’s factor price to another’s. The skill premium of factor H in terms of factor L is $$\frac{w_H}{w_L}\,. $$ When there are additional factors beyond skill groups, the general term is “factor-price ratio.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Heckscher–Ohlin theorem   | If there are two factors of production, two sectors with constant returns to scale, and two countries, then:<br>• A country exports the product whose production uses its abundant factor relatively intensively.<br>• It imports the product whose production uses its scarce factor relatively intensively.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Edgeworth box             | A rectangular-framed diagram depicting how an economy allocates factors.<br>• The sides of the frame show the factor endowments of the economy.<br>• Origins in the lower-left and upper-right corners correspond to zero employment for the sector at that origin.<br>• Any interior point represents a feasible factor-allocation where both sectors produce positive output.                                                                                                                    |
| Employment arrow          | An arrow (ray) from a sector’s origin (lower-left or upper-right corner of the Edgeworth box) to the interior equilibrium point.<br>• The slope of an employment arrow equals the factor-intensity ratio (vertical-axis factor relative to horizontal-axis factor) for that sector.<br>• In classic trade theory, there is no unemployment, so the two sectors’ employment arrows meet at their tips at the interior equilibrium.                                                                  |
| Stolper–Samuelson theorem | **Weak form:** If there are two factors of production and two sectors with constant returns to scale, then an increase in the relative domestic price of a product increases the relative income of the factor used relatively intensively in the production of that product.<br>**Strong form:** Under the same assumptions, an increase in the relative domestic price of a product unambiguously raises the real income of the factor used relatively intensively in that product’s production. |
| Inequality                | The dispersion of real income within a country or across countries, typically measured by indices such as:<br>• Theil index (aggregates within- and between-country inequality to measure global inequality)<br>• Gini index (primarily measures within-country inequality)                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Poverty                   | A condition in which a person’s real income falls below the level needed to afford basic participation in society. Unlike income inequality (a relative measure), poverty is based on an absolute real-income threshold. Since 2005, the World Bank’s extreme-poverty line is set at US\$ 1.25 per day (adjusted for purchasing power parity).                                                                                                                                                     |
| Rybczynski theorem        | If there are two factors of production, two sectors with constant returns to scale, and two countries, then an increase in the endowment of one factor (e.g., through immigration) will:<br>• Increase output in the sector that uses that factor relatively intensively<br>• Decrease output in the other sector<br>(Under free final-goods trade and incomplete specialization; product prices, factor prices, and factor intensities remain unchanged.)                                         |
| Incomplete specialization | A situation in classic trade models with more than one factor of production and two sectors in which both sectors produce in both countries under free trade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Freight factor            | The proportional increase in the delivered price $PD_i$ of good $i$ to destination D (due to transport costs) over the factory-gate price $PS_i$ in source country S:<br>$$d_{SD} \;=\; \frac{PD_i}{PS_i}\,. $$<br>If transport costs equal 10 percent of the factory-gate price, then the freight factor is 110 percent.                                                                                                                                                                          |
### **Assessments**

### **Concept Checks**

### **Comparative Advantage in the Heckscher–Ohlin Model**

- C1.1. Explain how the Heckscher–Ohlin trade theory uses country characteristics and sector characteristics to determine an economy's comparative advantage. If one economy is larger than another but has the same relative endowments, what will its comparative advantage be? Suppose the opportunity costs differ between countries. If a country doubles the number of its residents, but the proportion of skills in the population remains constant, how will the patterns of specialization change?
- C1.2. Mexico and California grow almonds and produce computers. Suppose almond growing is low-skill intensive and computer manufacturing is high-skill intensive. Suppose also that Mexico is low-skill labor-abundant and California is high-skill labor-abundant. What will the pattern of trade be between Mexico and California?
- C1.3. Brazil and Venezuela refine oil and manufacture airplanes. Brazil is high-skill labor abundant and Venezuela is low-skill labor abundant. Oil production is low-skill labor intensive and airplane manufacturing is high-skill labor intensive. Describe the pattern of trade between Brazil and Venezuela. Why does it occur?
- C1.4. There are two factors of production, arable land and physical capital. Agriculture intensively uses land but employs some capital. Manufacturing intensively uses capital but employs some land. If there are two countries with different relative endowments of land and capital, which country will export agricultural products? Will the country's terms of trade after opening to trade be larger or smaller than the country's opportunity cost of agricultural produce in terms of manufactures? Will the other country's terms of trade after opening to trade be larger or smaller than that country's opportunity cost of manufactures in terms of agricultural produce? Will there be gains from trade? Suppose one country has both less capital and less land than the other country. Will there be trade?

### **Income Inequality and the Stolper–Samuelson Theorem**

- C2.1. Suppose the global trade of final agricultural goods *A* and final manufactured goods *M* results in the same relative price paid for them in every open economy worldwide. If every industry in the world has the same production function, as in the Heckscher–Ohlin model, why is the intensity of the factor inputs the same in all industries worldwide?
- C2.2. Evaluate each of the following two statements as to whether they are true, false, or indeterminate. (1) In the Heckscher–Ohlin model, a country's industries will produce with the same factor intensities after trade as before trade. (2) The industry in which a worker is employed determines whether her real wage increases or decreases after trade liberalization.
- C2.3. Evaluate each of the following two statements as to whether they are true, false, or indeterminate. (1) In a two-country, two-sector model with two factors of production and identical production technologies, if one of the countries has a relatively abundant workforce of lowincome labor, trade will further reduce the real incomes of the laborers. (2) In a two-country,

two-sector model with two factors of production and identical production technologies, if trade increases the income inequality in one country, it must reduce the income inequality in the other country.

- C2.4. Mexico and California grow almonds and produce computers. What will happen to the wages for almond growers and computer-making workers in Mexico and California if (1) almond growing is low-skill intensive and computer manufacturing is high-skill intensive, and (2) Mexico is low-skill labor-abundant and California is high-skill labor-abundant?
- C2.5. Discuss two reasons why international trade may have caused income inequality to become more pronounced in Latin America in the 1990s. Offer two alternative reasons why international trade may not have been the cause.
- C2.6. There are two industries in Mexico, sesame seeds *S* and cars *C*. Each industry employs lowskilled and high-skilled labor as depicted in the Edgeworth box in Figure 4.12A. Labor is perfectly mobile across industries. Which industry is more low-skill intensive? Suppose Mexico is relatively abundant in low-skilled labor compared to its trading partners. In which industry does Mexico have a comparative advantage? Suppose Mexico opens up to free trade. Depict a new equilibrium point in the Edgeworth box after trade. How will the incomes of low-skilled laborers in the sesame-seeds industry change? How will the incomes of low-skilled laborers in the car industry change? How will the incomes of high-skilled laborers in the sesame-seeds industry change? How will the incomes of high-skilled laborers in the car industry change? Briefly explain your answers.
- C2.7. How does poverty differ from income inequality? Can poverty decline when income inequality is increasing? Give an example if your answer is yes. Explain your rationale if your answer is no.
- C2.8. The home and foreign economies produce two goods each, machines and food, and use two factors to do so, capital *K* and labor *L*. A machine is produced using 4 units of labor for each unit of capital, whereas food is produced using 10 units of labor per unit of capital. The economy's total resources are 400 units of labor and 100 units of capital. Use an Edgeworth box to determine the allocation of resources. (You do not need to draw the box to exact scale.) Suppose the Home economy accumulates more capital, doubling the available units of it to 200. How will the production of machines and food be affected? Use the Edgeworth box you created to illustrate your answer. (You do not need to draw the changes to exact scale.)
- C2.9. There are two industries and two fully mobile factors of production, labor (*L*) and capital (*K*). Labor earns a wage *w* and capital a rental rate *r*. Labor is used relatively intensely in agriculture (A) and capital is used relatively intensely in manufacturing (M). The home economy is relatively abundantly endowed with labor. Consider the factor markets in the home economy as depicted in Figure 4.12F. Suppose the home economy experiences an adverse terms-of-trade shock so that the relative price of agricultural goods (*PA/PM*) drops. How does the total employment of labor in agriculture *L<sup>A</sup>* and the total use of capital in agriculture *K<sup>A</sup>* change? How do the relative factor inputs of capital per labor in agriculture (*KA/LA*) and in manufacturing (*KM/LM*) change? Depict the new equilibrium in the diagram. How does the factor-price ratio *w/r* respond in equilibrium?

C2.10. Consider the Heckscher–Ohlin model for a *small* open economy. There are two factors of production, land *T* and labor *L*, and two sectors, food *F* and computers *C*. The home country is relatively abundantly endowed with labor. In a small open economy, local shocks to do *not* affect the prices of final goods. Consider the Edgeworth box in Figure 4.13I. Which sector is relatively labor intensive? Suppose the home country accumulates more labor and more land, but in a balanced way so that the relative land endowment per worker *T /*¯ *L*¯ remains constant. Extend the Edgeworth box to reflect the new endowment levels of the home economy. If the prices of final goods remain constant, do the economy's factor prices change? Depict the new vectors of factor inputs for the two industries. How can you determine their slopes from the factor prices?

### **Migration and the Rybczynski Theorem**

- C3.1. There are two countries that trade freely with each other, two sectors (agriculture and manufacturing), and two factors of production (low-skilled and high-skilled labor). Take the perspective of a country that loses low-skilled workers to emigration. You may use Figure 4.8 in the text reversely to derive your answers to the following questions. As low-skilled workers emigrate, how does the skill premium *wH/w<sup>L</sup>* change if both countries trade final goods freely? How does the intensity of skilled workers employed *Hi/L<sup>i</sup>* in each sector *i* (agriculture *i* = *A* and manufacturing *i* = *M*) change with emigration? How does total employment in the two sectors change with emigration?
- C3.2. There are two trading countries, two industries, and two factors of production. The two factors of production are low-skilled and high-skilled labor. The two industries are cars and footwear. The home country is relatively high-skill abundant. The car industry is high-skill intensive, whereas the footwear industry is low-skill intensive. What good will the home economy export if it is open to free trade? Now suppose low-skilled migrants from a third country increase the home-country's low-skilled labor force by one-fifth, but there is no migration into the foreign country. Education policies increase the amount of high-skilled labor by one-fifth in the home country, but there is no change in the high-skill endowment in the foreign country. What good will the home country export now if it is open to free trade? How does the relative price of cars change in free-trade equilibrium? What does this imply for the home country's terms of trade? How does the home country's relative production pattern (*QC/Q<sup>F</sup>* ) change?
- C3.3. There are two countries: Home (no asterisk) and Foreign (asterisk). There are two industries: food (F) and computers (C). And there are two factors of production: land *T* and labor *L*. The pair of Edgeworth boxes in Figure 4.13H depicts the factor markets for the home country in the upper-right Edgeworth box and the factor markets for the foreign country in the lower-left Edgeworth box. Suppose the home country's Edgeworth box depicts the equilibrium under free trade. Which industry is relatively land intensive? Which country is relatively land abundant? Which country exports computers? Complete the foreign country's Edgeworth box (lower-left box) under free trade. Combine the arrows to depict worldwide computer and worldwide food production under free trade (as if there were only one location and one arrow for each industry). If the world had no borders so that land and labor could migrate freely, would global production be different? Why?

### **Curved Production Possibilities and Incomplete Specialization**

- C4.1. The diagram in Figure 4.14N depicts Mexico's and California's production possibilities and the relative price of computers and roses in the world market. The triangle connecting the two points labeled *W*CA and the triangle connecting the two points labeled *W*MEX are identical in size. Do the trade lines have a slope of *p*roses*/p*computers or the converse? Show Mexico's consumption and production of computers in the diagram. Is Mexico a net exporter of computers? Show California's consumption and production of roses in the diagram. Is California a net exporter of roses? What is Mexico's trade balance? Which country gains from free trade? Why? (*Note*: A version of this question can also be found in concept check C3.3 in Chapter 14, where a similar graph is interpreted in terms of comparative advantage in international capital markets.)
- C4.2. Saudi Arabia produces crude oil and grows food with some unspecified number of factors of production. The opportunity costs of crude oil in terms of food change with the production pattern. Saudi Arabia's opportunity costs of crude oil production in terms of food are lower than those of its trading partners for any ray from the origin. In the diagram in Figure 4.13L, draw a production possibility frontier that is consistent with the above assumptions. Depict some initial world trade equilibrium and the consumption possibilities of Saudi Arabia that are consistent with these assumptions. Suppose Saudi Arabia's terms of trade improve. Depict the resulting change to Saudi Arabia's consumption possibilities. What happens to relative crude oil output *QC/Q<sup>F</sup>* in world trade equilibrium? Is there an example of a trading pattern so that Saudi Arabia's gains from trade *fall* although its terms of trade improve? Are the terms of trade a good indicator of a country's overall welfare in general? Explain.
- C4.3. Be warned, this question requires your knowledge of an indifference curve from your principles of economics course. Consider an economy with no production and an endowment of two final goods: avocados *A* and metals *M*.. The initial endowment is depicted in the diagram in Figure 4.13M. Consider the country to be in autarky (no trade). Draw an indifference curve that is consistent with consumption of the economy's endowment. Now suppose the country opens to free trade. Show that there are gains from trade if the world's relative prices of the goods are different than the relative prices of the goods in the economy when it is in autarky. Now consider the economy's production possibility frontier. For autarky, depict a production possibility frontier so that producers optimally choose to supply exactly the final goods combination depicted with the black dot in Figure 4.13M, and so that consumers optimally choose to consume the combination of goods at the black dot. Now suppose the country opens to free trade again. Show that there are positive gains from specialization in production, in addition to the gains from trading endowments, if the world's relative prices differ from the relative autarky prices.
- C4.4. Consider an economy in autarky and two sectors of production as well as two sectors that differ in their factor intensities. Depict a curved production possibility frontier and place a production and a consumption point in autarky. Pick one sector as the economy's sector with a comparative advantage, and open the economy to free trade. Depict a production mix and a consumption mix that is consistent with the economy's opening. Compared to the export good's opportunity costs in autarky, is the relative price of the export good larger or smaller than before free trade? Is it justified to think of complete trade liberalization as an equivalent to improving terms of trade?

#### **The Heckscher–Ohlin Model and the Gravity Equation**

C5.1. Use a production possibility frontier (PPF) diagram for the Heckscher–Ohlin model with two countries, two sectors, and two production factors (such as in the right panel of Figure 4.10). Draw the PPF of both countries on the same diagram. Compare the rays reflecting the product mixes and the rays reflecting the consumption choice to show that

$$
\gamma_{Si} \equiv \frac{Q_{Si}}{\sum_{C} Q_{Ci}} = \frac{Y_{Si}}{Y_i^W} > 1/2
$$

for a country *S* and a sector *i* that relatively intensively uses the production factor that is relatively abundant in that country. What information would you need to compute the exact value of *γSi*?

C5.2. The freight factor from a source country *S* to a destination country *D* is *dSD* = *dSdD*. Shipping from the source country to every good's global supply pool costs a freight factor *d<sup>S</sup>* and the consumer withdrawing the goods from the supply pool costs a freight factor of *dD*. Explain why shipping costs are symmetric in this case, *dSD* equals *dDS*. What is the final price *PDi* at the destination country *D* in terms of *dS*, *d<sup>D</sup>* and the factory gate price in the source country *PSi*? If the law of one price holds, so that *PSi* = *PDi*, how do *d<sup>S</sup>* and *d<sup>D</sup>* have to be related?

### **Questions**

- Q.1. Consider the home country, which has a small open economy. There are two factors of production: capital earning the rental rate *r* and labor earning the wage *w*; and two sectors: cars (C) and food (F). Car manufacturing is relatively capital intensive. The home country is relatively capital abundant. Which industry is the home country's export industry? Why? What are the home country's terms of trade: *PC/P<sup>F</sup>* or *P<sup>F</sup> /PC*? Use the empty Edgeworth box in Figure 4.13K to answer the following questions. Depict a possible equilibrium in the Edgeworth box of Figure 4.13K. Suppose the country's terms of trade worsen. Which sector shrinks, and which expands? State the Stolper–Samuelson Theorem (in a form of your liking). How does the factor price ratio (the wage-rental ratio) *w/r* change when the terms of trade worsen? How does the capital intensity change in the car industry? How does the food intensity change in the car industry? Depict the new equilibrium in the Edgeworth box of Figure 4.13K.
- Q.2. Consider Chile, a country abundant in high-skilled labor compared to its Latin American trading partners. The depicted Edgeworth box in Figure 4.12B is relatively wider for Chile's trading partners. There are two sectors, rose growing (*R*) and computer manufacturing (*C*). There are two factor of production, high-skilled labor (*H*) and low-skilled labor (*L*). Which industry is high-skilled labor intensive? Which is low-skilled labor intensive? The diagram depicts Chile in autarky. Suppose Chile dismantles all trade barriers with its trading partners. Which Chilean industry will expand and which will shrink? Draw the new equilibrium on the diagram. How does the relative employment of high-skilled and low-skilled workers change in the rose-growing industry versus computer manufacturing? Determine how the wages of highskilled and low-skilled workers must change. Does income inequality increase in Chile? Does poverty necessarily increase in the country?
- Q.3. Consider Costa Rica, a country abundant in *high*-skilled labor compared to its Latin American and the East Asian trading partners. The Edgeworth box in Figure 4.12C is even flatter for

the trading partners. There are two sectors, rose growing and computer manufacturing. Interpreting the diagram in Figure 4.12C, which sector is low-skill intensive, and which is high-skill intensive? The diagram depicts Costa Rica in autarky. Suppose Costa Rica dismantles all trade barriers with its Latin American and East Asian trading partners. Which Costa Rican sector will expand and which will shrink? Draw the new equilibrium on the diagram. How does the relative employment of high-skilled and low-skilled workers change in the rose-growing sector and in computer manufacturing? Determine how the relative wage of high-skilled and lowskilled workers must change. Does income inequality increase in Costa Rica? Does poverty necessarily increase in the country?

- Q.4. Consider the allocation of low- and high-skilled labor to grain and textiles production in Costa Rica as depicted in Figure 4.12D. Costa Rica is a closed economy in the diagram. Suppose that the ratio between high- and low-skilled workers in Costa Rica's trading partners' economies is one. Is Costa Rica relatively low-skill or high-skill abundant? Which industry is relatively lowskill intensive: grain or textiles? The Heckscher–Ohlin Theorem states that a country exports the good whose production makes relatively intensive use of the relatively abundant factor. Which industry will expand in Costa Rica after Costa Rica opens up to free trade? Depict the allocation of labor after trade liberalization. Does wage inequality in Costa Rica increase or drop after trade liberalization?
- Q.5. The graph in Figure 4.12E depicts a relatively land-abundant country in autarky. The country can allocate labor and land to computer manufacturing (*C*) and food production (*F*). Which sector is more land intensive? State the implication of the Heckscher–Ohlin Theorem for the pattern of trade. Which sector will expand when the country opens up to free trade? Will the other sector shrink or expand after trade? Depict the land and labor allocation to industries after trade. Did the land intensity of the food industry increase, drop, or remain constant? Did the land intensity of the computer industry increase, drop, or remain constant?
- Q.6. At *current* goods and thus factor prices, cloth is produced using 20 hours of labor for each acre of land, whereas food is produced using only 5 hours of labor per acre of land. (1) *Resource allocation*. The economy's total resources are 600 hours of labor and 60 acres of land. Use an Edgeworth box to determine the allocation of resources. (2) *Endowment changes*. Now suppose the labor supply increases from 600 to 900 to 1,200 hours. Using the Edgeworth box, trace out the changing allocation of resources. (3) *Extreme endowment changes*. What would have to happen if the labor supply increased beyond 1,200 hours?
- Q.7. Consider the Home country, an open economy. There are two sectors: food production (F) and manufacturing (M). There are two factors of production: capital (*K*) and labor (*L*). The two factors are perfectly mobile. All countries in the world use identical technologies to produce food and manufactured goods. Suppose the home country and the rest of the world trade under incomplete specialization. Determine from the Edgeworth box in Figure 4.13G which sector is relatively capital intensive and which sector is relatively labor intensive. Suppose a number of workers migrates to the Home country. Depict for the Home country how the Edgeworth box changes. Make the change *small*. How do relative factor prices change if the home country and the rest of the world continue to trade final goods under incomplete specialization? How do relative factor inputs (the capital-labor ratios by industry) change after migration? How do outputs in the home country change after migration?

Q.8. This question is a variation of the earlier concept check C3.3. There are two countries: Home (no asterisk) and Foreign (asterisk). There are two sectors: food (F) and computers (C). There are two factors of production: land *T* earning a land rent *r* and labor *L* earning a wage *w*. The pair of Edgeworth boxes in Figure 4.14O depicts the factor markets for the home country in the lower-left Edgeworth box and the factor markets for the foreign country in the upper-right Edgeworth box. Suppose the home country's Edgeworth box depicts the equilibrium under free trade. Which sector is relatively labor intensive? Which country is relatively labor abundant? Which country exports food? Complete the foreign country's Edgeworth box (upper-right box) under free trade. Combine the arrows to depict worldwide food and worldwide computer production under free trade (as if there were only one location and one arrow for each sector). If the world had no borders so that land could move freely and labor could be offshored at no cost, would global production be different? Why?

### **Empirical Exercises**

- E.1. This exercise asks you to compute two alternative measures of skill intensity by industry. Go to the webpage *http://www.nber.org/data/nberces5809.html* and download from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) its latest edition of the *NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database* for the United States, using the version with the SIC industry classification (459 fourdigit 1987 SIC industries). Create a new industry identifier by chopping off the first two digits from the four-digit SIC codes. You can find descriptive titles for these 20 SIC two-digit industries at URL *econ.ucsd.edu/muendler/book*. Construct the *Hi/L<sup>i</sup>* ratios by industry for the year 2009 as in the text on page 132 (using the variables *prode* and *emp*). Now compute the mean wage by industry in 2009 (using the variables *pay* and *emp*). How closely are the industries' mean wages and their *Hi/L<sup>i</sup>* ratios related? To assess their association, you can compute a correlation coefficient, or a rank correlation coefficient, or a slope coefficient from an ordinary least square regression. (If you choose to compute all three, how do they compare?)
- E.2. Go to URL *econ.ucsd.edu/muendler/book*, download the combined CEPII-WTF bilateral trade data and extract the Mahakitsiri (2012) skill endowment measure. For the common countries in Table 3.1 and Figure 3.4 of the preceding Chapter 3, assess how their relative manufacturing productivities in 2005 and their relative manufacturing wages in 2011 relate to the Mahakitsiri (2012) skill endowment measure.
- E.3. Go to URL *econ.ucsd.edu/muendler/book*, download the combined CEPII-WTF bilateral trade data, and extract the variables for RCA, GCA, the Groningen Growth and Development Centre producer price data (as in Figure 3.11 in the preceding Chapter 3), and the Mahakitsiri (2012) skill intensity and skill endowment measures. Find the correlation between the GGDC producer price data and the Mahakitsiri (2012) skill intensity and skill endowment measure. The run a regression of RCA on the GGDC producer price data and the Mahakitsiri (2012) skill intensity and skill endowment measure. Finally, run a regression of GCA on the GGDC producer price data and the Mahakitsiri (2012) skill intensity and skill endowment measure. What have you learned?
