## **Chapter 4**

# **Trade, Endowments, and the Income Distribution**

The dispersion of incomes within countries has risen steadily over the past five or six decades. Today, more than half of the worldwide income inequality is due to the within-country income disparities. At no time since the last World War has the average within-country disparity been larger.<sup>1</sup> Although the within-country income disparity has risen on average around the world, in countries such as Brazil, China, Germany, India, and Mexico it has actually come down and dropped markedly. In contrast, income inequality within Japan, Russia, and South Africa has increased. In the United Kingdom and the United States the inequality in incomes jumped up drastically even before the Great Recession.<sup>2</sup> Rising inequality is a concern because it is often related to increasing poverty, and inequality can coincide with political conflict and a high crime rate. Numerous economic changes can affect income inequality, including a nation's technical progress, innovation, and the perpetual shift in people's tastes and demands. Can globalization explain why income inequality widens in some regions and narrows elsewhere?

### **Learning Objectives**

After reading this chapter you should be able to:

- **LO1** Explain how the combination of a country's relative factor endowment and a sector's relative factor intensity gives rise to comparative advantage in the Heckscher–Ohlin model.
- **LO2** Describe how an Edgeworth Box depicts factor markets. Then relate the shape of the Edgeworth Box to a country's relative factor endowments and relate the slope of the sectoral employment arrows to relative factor uses.
- **LO3** Discuss why migration does not change factor prices in the Heckscher–Ohlin model but results in some sectors expanding and others contracting.
- **L04** Understand why two or more mobile factors of production generate a curved production possibility frontier.
