# Exchange Rates and the Foreign Exchange Market: An Asset Approach  

IrneJauclhye2d0a1l1o, twhep oUi.nSt adtoal ltairm’seprwichenagthaiensUtnai beadsSkteatteosf wmajsosrtrfuogregiligngcwuritrhenhciigehs higher than at any point in the previous 15 years—about 43 percent above its low point—at a time when the U.S. economy had the highest unemployment since the [Great Depression](../../Bridgewater/Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%201928-1937.md). What changes in the U.S. and world economy could possibly have driven such a dramatic change in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md)? In this chapter, we will begin our study of the causes and effects of exchange [rate changes](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md).  

The price of one [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) in terms of another is called an exchange rate. At $4\ \mathsf{P}.M$ . London time on June 3, 2020, you would have needed 1.1219 dollars to buy one unit of the European [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md), the euro, so the dollar’s exchange rate against the euro was $\$1219$ per euro. Because of their strong influence on the current account and other macroeconomic variables, exchange rates are among the most important prices in an open economy.  

Because an exchange rate, the price of one country’s money in terms of another’s, is also an [asset price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md), the principles governing the behavior of other asset prices also govern the behavior of exchange rates. As you will recall from ­Chapter 13, the defining characteristic of an asset is that it is a form of wealth, a way of transferring purchasing power from the present into the future. The price an asset commands today is therefore directly related to the purchasing power over goods and services that buyers expect it to yield in the future. Similarly, today’s dollar/euro exchange rate is closely tied to people’s [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) about the future level of that rate. Just as the price of Google stock rises immediately upon favorable news about Google’s future prospects, so do exchange rates respond immediately to any news concerning future [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) values.  

Our general goals in this chapter are to understand the role of exchange rates in [international trade](../../Globalization/Chapter%202-The%20Principle%20Of%20Comparative%20Advantage.md) and to understand how exchange rates are determined. To begin, we first learn how exchange rates allow us to compare the prices of different countries’ goods and services. Next, we describe the international asset market in which currencies are traded and show how equilibrium exchange rates are determined in that market. A final section underlines our asset market approach by showing how today’s exchange rate responds to changes in the expected future values of exchange rates.  

# LEARNING GOALS  

After reading this chapter, you will be able to:  

Relate exchange [rate changes](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md) to changes in the relative prices of countries’ exports. Describe the structure and functions of the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md). Use exchange rates to calculate and compare [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on assets denominated in different currencies. Apply the [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) condition to find equilibrium exchange rates. ■ Find the effects of [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and expectation shifts on exchange rates.  

# Exchange Rates and International Transactions  

Exchange rates play a central role in [international trade](../../Globalization/Chapter%202-The%20Principle%20Of%20Comparative%20Advantage.md) because they allow us to compare the prices of goods and services produced in different countries. A consumer deciding which of two American cars to buy must compare their dollar prices, for example, $\$44,500$ (for a Lincoln Continental) or $\$27,000$ (for a Ford Taurus). But how is the same consumer to compare either of these prices with the 3,500,000 Japanese yen it costs to buy a Nissan Leaf from Japan? To make this comparison, he or she must know the relative price of dollars and yen.  

You can view the relative prices of currencies in real time on the Internet. Exchange rates are also reported daily in newspapers’ financial sections. Table 14-1 shows the dollar, euro, and pound exchange rates for currencies reported in the Financial Times on June 4, 2020 (these rates being the ones quoted in London at $4\mathrm{{P}.\mathrm{{M}}}$ . of the previous day, June 3, 2020). An exchange rate can be quoted in two ways: as the price of the foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) in terms of dollars (for example, \$1.1219 per euro) or as its inverse, the price of dollars in terms of the foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) (for example, €0.8913 per dollar). The first of these exchange [rate quotations](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) (dollars per foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) unit) is said to be in direct (or “American”) terms; the second (foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) units per dollar) is in indirect (or “European”) terms. Each row in the table shows the price of the dollar, euro, and pound in terms of a national [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).1  

Households and firms use exchange rates to translate foreign prices into domestic [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) terms. Once the money prices of domestic goods and imports have been expressed in terms of the same [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md), households and firms can compute the relative prices that affect [international trade](../../Globalization/Chapter%202-The%20Principle%20Of%20Comparative%20Advantage.md) flows.  

# Domestic and Foreign Prices  

If we know the exchange rate between two countries’ currencies, we can compute the price of one country’s exports in terms of the other country’s money. For example, how many dollars would it cost to buy an Edinburgh Woolen Mill sweater costing 50 British pounds (£50)?

Rates are derived from WM Reuters Spot Rates and MorningStar (latest rates at time of production). Some values are rounded.

The exchange rates printed in this table are also available at www.FT.com/marketsdata.  

The answer is found by multiplying the price of the sweater in pounds, 50, by the price of a pound in terms of dollars—the dollar’s exchange rate against the pound. At an exchange rate of $\$1.50$ per pound (expressed in American terms), the dollar price of the sweater is  
$$
(1.50\S/£)\times(£50)=\S75.
$$  

A change in the dollar/pound exchange rate would alter the sweater’s dollar price. At an exchange rate of 1.25 per pound, the sweater would cost only  
$$
(1.25\mathbb{S}/£)\times(£50)=\mathbb{S}62.50,
$$  

assuming its price in terms of pounds remained the same. At an exchange rate of $\$1.75$ per pound, the sweater’s dollar price would be higher, equal to  
$$
(1.75\mathbb{S}/£)\times(£50)=\mathbb{S}87.50.
$$  

Changes in exchange rates are described as depreciations or appreciations. A ­depreciation of the pound against the dollar is a fall in the dollar price of pounds, for example, a change in the exchange rate from $\$1.50$ per pound to $\$1.25$ per pound. The preceding example shows that all else equal, a depreciation of a country’s [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) makes its goods cheaper for foreigners. A rise in the pound’s price in terms of dollars— for example, from $\$1.50$ per pound to $\$1.75$ per pound—is an appreciation of the pound against the dollar. All else equal, an appreciation of a country’s [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) makes its goods more expensive for foreigners.  

The exchange [rate changes](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md) discussed in the example simultaneously alter the prices Britons pay for American goods. At an exchange rate of $\$1.50$ per pound, the pound price of a pair of American designer jeans costing $\$45$ is $(\mathbb{S}45)/(1.50\mathbb{S}/£)=£30$ . A change in the exchange rate from $\$1.50$ per pound to $\$1.25$ per pound, while a depreciation of the pound against the dollar, is also a rise in the pound price of dollars, an appreciation of the dollar against the pound. This appreciation of the dollar makes the American jeans more expensive for Britons by raising their pound price from £30 to  
$$
(\mathbb{S}45)/(1.25\$/£)=£36.
$$  

The change in the exchange rate from $\$1.50$ per pound to $\$1.75$ per pound—an appreciation of the pound against the dollar but a depreciation of the dollar against the pound—lowers the pound price of the jeans from £30 to  
$$
(\mathbb{S}45)/(1.75\$/£)=£25.71.
$$  

As you can see, descriptions of exchange [rate changes](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md) as depreciations or appreciations can be bewildering because when one [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) depreciates against another, the second [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) must simultaneously appreciate against the first. To avoid confusion in discussing exchange rates, we must always keep track of which of the two currencies we are examining has depreciated or appreciated against the other.  

If we remember that a depreciation of the dollar against the pound is at the same time an appreciation of the pound against the dollar, we reach the following conclusion: When a country’s [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) depreciates, foreigners find that its exports are cheaper and domestic residents find that imports from abroad are more expensive. An appreciation has opposite effects: Foreigners pay more for the country’s products and domestic consumers pay less for foreign products.  

# Exchange Rates and Relative Prices  

Import and export demands, like the demands for all goods and services, are influenced by relative prices, such as the price of sweaters in terms of designer jeans. We have just seen how exchange rates allow individuals to compare domestic and foreign money prices by expressing them in a common [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) unit. Carrying this analysis one step further, we can see that exchange rates also allow individuals to compute the relative prices of goods and services whose money prices are quoted in different currencies.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>TABLE14-2</td><td colspan="3">$/ExchangeRatesandtheRelativePrice ofAmericanDesigner JeansandBritish Sweaters</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Exchange rate $/f 1.25 Relative price (pairs of jeans/sweater) 1.39</td><td>1.50 1.75 1.67 1.94</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Note: The preceding calculations assume unchanged money prices of $45 per pair of jeans and f50 per</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">sweater.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

An American trying to decide how much to spend on American jeans and how much to spend on British sweaters must translate their prices into a common [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) to compute the price of sweaters in terms of jeans. As we have seen, an exchange rate of $\$1.50$ per pound means that an American pays $\$75$ for a sweater priced at £50 in Britain. Because the price of a pair of American jeans is $\$45$ , the price of a sweater in terms of a pair of jeans is (\$75 per sweater)>(\$45 per pair of jeans) $=1.67$ pairs of jeans per sweater. Naturally, a Briton faces the same relative price of (£50 per sweater)>(£30 per pair of jeans) $=1.67$ pairs of jeans per sweater.  

Table 14-2 shows the relative prices implied by exchange rates of $\$1.25$ per pound, $\$1.50$ per pound, and $\$1.75$ per pound, on the assumption that the dollar price of jeans and the pound price of sweaters are unaffected by the exchange [rate changes](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md). To test your understanding, try to calculate these relative prices for yourself and confirm that the outcome of the calculation is the same for a Briton and for an American.  

The table shows that if the goods’ money prices do not change, an appreciation of the dollar against the pound makes sweaters cheaper in terms of jeans (each pair of jeans buys more sweaters) while a depreciation of the dollar against the pound makes sweaters more expensive in terms of jeans (each pair of jeans buys fewer sweaters). The computations illustrate a general principle: All else equal, an appreciation of a country’s [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) raises the relative price of its exports and lowers the relative price of its imports. Conversely, a depreciation lowers the relative price of a country’s exports and raises the relative price of its imports.

Just as other prices in the economy are determined by the interaction of buyers and sellers, exchange rates are determined by the interaction of the households, firms, and [financial institutions](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) that buy and sell foreign currencies to make international payments. The market in which international [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) trades take place is called the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md).  

# The Actors  

The major participants in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) are commercial banks, corporations that engage in [international trade](../../Globalization/Chapter%202-The%20Principle%20Of%20Comparative%20Advantage.md), nonbank [financial institutions](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) such as assetmanagement firms and insurance companies, and central banks. Individuals may also participate in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md)—for example, the tourist who buys foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) at a hotel’s front desk—but such cash transactions are an insignificant fraction of total foreign exchange trading.  

We now describe the major actors in the market and their roles.  

1.	 Commercial banks. Commercial banks are at the center of the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) because almost every sizable international transaction involves the debiting and crediting of accounts at commercial banks in various financial centers. Thus, the vast majority of foreign exchange transactions involve the exchange of bank deposits denominated in different currencies.  

Let’s look at an example. Suppose ExxonMobil Corporation wishes to pay €160,000 to a German supplier. First, ExxonMobil gets an exchange rate quotation from its own commercial bank, the Third National Bank. Then it instructs Third National to debit ExxonMobil’s dollar account and pay €160,000 into the supplier’s account at a German bank. If the exchange rate quoted to ExxonMobil by Third National is \$1.2 per euro, $\$192,000$ $(=\$1.2$ per euro $\times\in160{,}000)$ is debited from ExxonMobil’s account. The final result of the transaction is the exchange of a $\$192,000$ deposit at Third National Bank (now owned by the German bank that supplied the euros) for the €160,000 deposit used by Third National to pay ExxonMobil’s German supplier.  

As the example shows, banks routinely enter the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) to meet the needs of their customers—primarily corporations. In addition, a bank will also quote to other banks exchange rates at which it is willing to buy currencies from them and sell currencies to them. Foreign [currency trading](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) among banks—called interbank trading—accounts for much of the activity in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md). In fact, the exchange rates listed in Table 14-1 are interbank rates, the rates banks charge each other. No amount less than $\$1$ million trades at those rates. The rates available to corporate customers, called “retail” rates, are usually less favorable than the “wholesale” interbank rates. The difference between the retail and the wholesale rates is the bank’s compensation for doing the business.  

Because their international operations are so extensive, large commercial banks are well suited to bring buyers and sellers of currencies together. A multinational corporation wishing to convert $\$100,000$ into Swedish kronor might find it difficult and costly to locate other corporations wishing to sell the right amount of kronor. By serving many customers simultaneously through a single large purchase of kronor, a bank can economize on these search costs.  

2.	 Corporations. Corporations with operations in several countries frequently make or receive payments in currencies other than that of the country in which they are headquartered. To pay workers at a plant in Mexico, for example, IBM may need Mexican pesos. If IBM has only dollars earned by selling computers in the United States, it can acquire the pesos it needs by buying them with its dollars in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md).   
3.	 Nonbank [financial institutions](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md). Over the years, deregulation of [financial markets](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) in the United States, Japan, and other countries has encouraged nonbank [financial institutions](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) such as mutual funds to offer their customers a broader range of services, many of them indistinguishable from those offered by banks. Among these have been services involving foreign exchange transactions. [Institutional investors](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%204%20Institutional%20Trading.md) such as pension funds often trade foreign currencies. So do insurance companies. [Hedge funds](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md), which cater to very wealthy individuals and are not bound by the government regulations that limit mutual funds’ [trading strategies](../../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md), trade actively in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md).   
4.	 Central banks. In the previous chapter, we learned that central banks sometimes intervene in foreign exchange markets. While the volume of central bank transactions is typically not large, the impact of these transactions may be great. The reason for this impact is that participants in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) watch central bank actions closely for clues about future macroeconomic policies that may affect exchange rates. Government agencies other than central banks may also trade in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md), but central banks are the most regular official participants.  

# Characteristics of the Market  

Foreign exchange trading takes place in many financial centers, with the largest volumes of trade occurring in such major cities as London (the largest market), New York, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, and Singapore. The worldwide volume of foreign exchange trading is enormous, and it has ballooned over the past three decades. In April 1989, the average total value of global foreign exchange trading was close to \$600 ­billion per day. A total of $\$184$ billion was traded daily in London, \$115 billion in the United States, and $\$111$ billion in Tokyo. Thirty years later, in April 2019, the daily global value of foreign exchange trading had jumped to around $\$6.6$ trillion. A total of $\$3.58$ trillion was traded daily in the United Kingdom, $\$1.37$ trillion in the United States, and $\$376$ billion in Japan.2  

Telephone, fax, and Internet links among the major foreign exchange trading centers make each a part of a single world market on which the sun never sets. Economic news released at any time of the day is immediately transmitted around the world and may set off a flurry of activity by market participants. Even after trading in New York has finished, New York–based banks and corporations with affiliates in other time zones can remain active in the market. Foreign exchange traders may deal from their homes when a late-night communication alerts them to important developments in a financial center on another continent.  

The integration of financial centers implies that there can be no significant difference between the dollar/euro exchange rate quoted in New York at 9 a.m. and the dollar/euro exchange rate quoted in London at the same time (which corresponds to $2\mathrm{P}.\mathrm{M}$ . London time). If the euro were selling for $\$1.1$ in New York and $\$1.2$ in London, profits could be made through [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md), the process of buying a [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) cheap and selling it dear. At the prices listed, a trader could, for instance, purchase €1 million in New York for $\$1.1$ million and immediately sell the euros in London for $\$1.2$ million, making a pure profit of $\$100,000$ . If all traders tried to cash in on the opportunity, however, their demand for euros in New York would drive up the dollar price of euros there, and their supply of euros in London would drive down the dollar price of euros there. Very quickly, the difference between the New York and London exchange rates would disappear. Since foreign exchange traders carefully watch their computer screens for [arbitrage opportunities](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md), the few that arise are small and very short-lived.  

While a foreign exchange transaction can match any two currencies, most transactions (88.3 percent in April 2019) are exchanges of foreign currencies for U.S. dollars. This is true even when a bank’s goal is to sell one nondollar [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) and buy another! A bank wishing to sell Swiss francs and buy Israeli shekels, for example, will usually sell its francs for dollars and then use the dollars to buy shekels. While this procedure may appear roundabout, it is actually cheaper for the bank than the alternative of trying to find a holder of shekels who wishes to buy Swiss francs. The advantage of trading through the dollar is a result of the United States’ importance in the world economy. Because the volume of international transactions involving dollars is so great, it is not hard to find parties willing to trade dollars against Swiss francs or shekels. In contrast, relatively few transactions require direct exchanges of Swiss francs for shekels.3  

Because of its pivotal role in so many foreign exchange deals, the U.S. dollar is sometimes called a vehicle [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). A vehicle [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) is one that is widely used to denominate international contracts made by parties who do not reside in the country that issues the vehicle [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). It has been suggested that the euro, which was introduced at the start of 1999, could evolve into a vehicle [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) on a par with the dollar. By April 2019, 32.3 percent of foreign exchange trades were against euros—less than half the share of the dollar and significantly below the figure of 39 percent clocked in 2010. Japan’s yen is the third most important [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md), with a market share of 16.8 percent. (All shares are out of 200 because two currencies are necessary for every foreign exchange trade.) The pound sterling, once second only to the dollar as a key international [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md), has declined greatly in importance and now stands in fourth place. China’s renminbi ranked eighth among the word’s currencies in 2019, with a market share of 4.3 percent—low, but much above its 0.9 percent share in 2010.4  

# Spot Rates and Forward Rates  

The foreign exchange transactions we have been discussing take place on the spot: Two parties agree to an exchange of bank deposits and execute the deal immediately. Exchange rates governing such “on-the-spot” trading are called spot exchange rates, and the deal is called a [spot transaction](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Futures%20and%20Forwards.md).  

Foreign exchange deals sometimes specify a future transaction date—one that may be 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, or even several years away. We call the exchange rates quoted in such transactions forward exchange rates. In a one-month forward transaction, for example, two parties may commit themselves on April 1 to a spot exchange of £100,000 for $\$155,000$ on May 1. The one-month forward exchange rate is therefore $\$1.55$ per pound, and it is generally different from the [spot rate](../../The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) and from the forward rates applied to different future dates. When you agree to sell pounds for dollars on a future date at a [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) agreed on today, you have “sold pounds forward” and “bought dollars forward.” The future date on which the currencies are actually exchanged is called the value date.5 Table 14-1 shows forward exchange rates for some major currencies, at the one-month, three-month, and one-year maturities.  

Forward and spot exchange rates, while not necessarily equal, do move closely together, as illustrated for monthly data on dollar/pound rates in Figure 14-1. The last section of this chapter, which discusses how forward exchange rates are determined, throws light on this close relationship between movements in [spot and forward rates](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md).

FIGURE 14-1  

# Dollar/Pound Spot and Forward Exchange Rates, 1983–2020  

Spot and forward exchange rates tend to move in a highly correlated fashion.  

Source: Datastream. Rates shown are 90-day forward exchange rates and spot exchange rates, at end of month.  

An example shows why parties may wish to engage in forward exchange transactions. Suppose Best Buy knows that in 30 days it must pay yen to a Japanese supplier for a shipment of radios arriving then. Best Buy can sell each radio for $\$100$ and must pay its supplier ¥9,000 per radio; its profit depends on the dollar/yen exchange rate. At a spot exchange rate of $\$0105$ per yen, Best Buy would pay $(\$0.0105,p e r y e n)\times(\yen\Psi,0.00p e r\:r a d i o)=$ $\$94.50$ per radio and would therefore make $\$5.50$ on each radio imported. But Best Buy will not have the funds to pay the supplier until the radios arrive and are sold. If over the next 30 days the dollar unexpectedly depreciates to $\$0115$ per yen, Best Buy will have to pay $(\mathbb{S}0.0115\mathrm{per}\mathrm{yen})\times(\mathbb{\Psi}9,000\mathrm{per}\mathrm{radio})=\mathbb{S}103.50$ per radio and so will take a $\$3.50$ loss on each.  

To avoid this risk, Best Buy can make a 30-day forward exchange deal with Bank of ­America. If Bank of America agrees to sell yen to Best Buy in 30 days at a rate of \$0.0107, Best Buy is assured of paying exactly (\$0.0107 per yen) $\times$ (¥9,000 per radio) $=\ \mathfrak{S}96.30$ per radio to the supplier. By buying yen and selling dollars forward, Best Buy is guaranteed a profit of $\$3.70$ per radio and is insured against the possibility that a sudden exchange rate change will turn a profitable importing deal into a loss. In the jargon of the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md), we would say that Best Buy has hedged its foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) risk.  

From now on, when we mention an exchange rate but don’t specify whether it is a [spot rate](../../The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) or a [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md), we will always be referring to the [spot rate](../../The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md). However, we will return to the [forward exchange rate](../../../Financial%20Engineering/A%20Primer%20on%20Currency%20Derivatives.md) and its role at the end of this chapter and later in this book.  

# Foreign Exchange Swaps  

A foreign exchange swap is a spot sale of a [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) combined with a forward repurchase of that [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). For example, suppose the Toyota auto company has just received \$1 million from American sales and knows it will have to pay those dollars to a California supplier in three months. Toyota’s asset-management department would meanwhile like to invest the $\$1$ million in euro bonds. A three-month swap of dollars into euros may result in lower brokers’ fees than the two separate transactions, possibly with different parties, of selling dollars for spot euros and selling the euros for dollars on the [forward market](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md). Swaps make up a significant proportion of all foreign exchange trading.  

# Futures and Options  

Several other [financial instruments](../../../Financial%20Instruments/A%20Practical%20Guide%20for%20Actuaries%20and%20other%20Business%20Professionals..md) traded in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md), like forward contracts, involve future exchanges of currencies. The timing and terms of the exchanges can differ, however, from those specified in forward contracts, giving traders additional flexibility in avoiding foreign exchange risk.  

When you buy a [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract, you buy a promise that a specified amount of foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) will be delivered on a specified date in the future. A [forward contract](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) between you and some other private party is an alternative way to ensure that you receive the same amount of foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) on the date in question. But while you have no choice about fulfilling your end of a forward deal, you can sell your [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract on an organized [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) exchange, realizing a profit or loss right away. Such a sale might appear advantageous, for example, if your views about the future [spot exchange rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Review%20Session%20Notes/Arbitrage%20Opportunity%20Accounting.md) were to change.  

A foreign exchange option gives its owner the right to buy or sell a specified amount of foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) at a specified price at any time up to a specified [expiration date](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). The other party to the deal, the option’s seller, is required to sell or buy the foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) at the discretion of the option’s owner, who is under no obligation to exercise his right.6  

Imagine you are uncertain about when in the next month a foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) payment will arrive. To avoid the risk of a loss, you may wish to buy a put option giving you the right to sell the foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) at a known exchange rate at any time during the month. If instead you expect to make a payment abroad sometime in the month, a call option, which gives you the right to buy foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) to make the payment at a known price, might be attractive. Options can be written on many underlying assets (including foreign exchange [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)), and, like [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), they are freely bought and sold. [Forwards](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md), swaps, [futures](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), and options are all examples of [financial derivatives](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments%20PSET%20Solutions.md), which we encountered in Chapter 13.  

# The Demand for Foreign Currency Assets  

We have now seen how banks, corporations, and other institutions trade foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) bank deposits in a worldwide [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) that operates 24 hours a day. To understand how exchange rates are determined by the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md), we first must ask how the major actors’ demands for different types of foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) deposits are determined.  

The demand for a foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) bank deposit is influenced by the same considerations that influence the demand for any other asset. Chief among these considerations is our view of what the deposit will be worth in the future. A foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) deposit’s future value depends in turn on two factors: the interest rate it offers and the expected change in the [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)’s exchange rate against other currencies.  

# Assets and Asset Returns  

As you will recall, people can hold wealth in many forms—stocks, bonds, cash, real estate, rare wines, diamonds, and so on. The object of acquiring wealth—of saving—is to transfer purchasing power into the future. We may do this to provide for our retirement years, for our heirs, or simply because we earn more than we need to spend in a particular year and prefer to save the balance for a rainy day.  

Defining [Asset Returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%201%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Overview/Some%20Stylized%20Empirical%20Facts%20About%20Asset%20Retur.md)  Because the object of saving is to provide for future consumption, we judge the desirability of an asset largely on the basis of its rate of return, that is, the percentage increase in value it offers over some time period. For example, suppose that at the beginning of 2021 you pay $\$100$ for a share of stock issued by Financial Soothsayers, Inc. If the stock pays you a dividend of \$1 at the beginning of 2022 and if the stock’s price rises from $\$100$ to $\$109$ per share over the year, then you have earned a rate of return of 10 percent on the stock over 2021—that is, your initial $\$100$ investment has grown in value to $\$110$ , the sum of the $\$1$ dividend and the $\$109$ you could get by selling your share. Had Financial ­Soothsayers stock still paid out its $\$1$ dividend but dropped in price to $\$89$ per share, your $\$100$ investment would be worth only $\$90$ by year’s end, giving a rate of return of negative 10 percent.  

You often cannot know with certainty the return that an asset will actually pay after you buy it. Both the dividend paid by a share of stock and the share’s resale price, for example, may be hard to predict. Your decision therefore must be based on an expected rate of return. To calculate an expected rate of return over some time period, you make your best forecast of the asset’s total value at the period’s end. The percentage difference between that expected future value and the price you pay for the asset today equals the asset’s expected rate of return over the time period.  

When we measure an asset’s rate of return, we compare how an [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in the asset changes in total value between two dates. In the previous example, we compared how the value of an [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in Financial Soothsayers stock changed between 2021 (\$100) and 2022 (\$110) to conclude that the rate of return on the stock was 10 percent per year. We call this a dollar rate of return because the two values we compare are expressed in terms of dollars. It is also possible, however, to compute different rates of return by expressing the two values in terms of a foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) or a commodity such as gold.  

The Real Rate of Return  The expected rate of return that savers consider in deciding which assets to hold is the expected real rate of return, that is, the rate of return computed by measuring asset values in terms of some broad representative basket of products that savers regularly purchase. It is the expected real return that matters because the ultimate goal of saving is future consumption, and only the real return measures the goods and services a saver can buy in the future in return for giving up some consumption (that is, saving) today.  

To continue our example, suppose the dollar value of an [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in Financial Soothsayers stock increases by 10 percent between 2021 and 2022 but the dollar prices of all goods and services also increase by 10 percent. Then in terms of output—that is, in real terms—the [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) would be worth no more in 2021 than in 2022. With a real rate of return of zero, Financial Soothsayers stock would not be a very desirable asset (because in the real world assets with positive real rates of return usually are available).  

Although savers care about expected real rates of return, rates of return expressed in terms of a [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) can still be used to compare real [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on different assets. Even if all dollar prices rise by 10 percent between 2021 and 2022, a rare bottle of wine whose dollar price rises by 25 percent is still a better [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) than a bond whose dollar value rises by 20 percent. The real rate of return offered by the wine is 15 percent $=25$ percent - 10 percent), while that offered by the bond is only 10 ­percent 1 $(=20$ percent - 10 percent). Notice that the difference between the dollar [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) of the two assets (25 percent - 20 percent) must equal the difference between their real [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) (15 percent $\mathit{\Theta}-\ 10$ percent). The reason for this equality is that given the two assets’ dollar [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md), a change in the rate at which the dollar prices of goods are rising changes both assets’ real [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) by the same amount.  

The distinction between real rates of return and dollar rates of return illustrates an important concept in studying how savers evaluate different assets: The [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on two assets cannot be compared unless they are measured in the same units. For example, it makes no sense to compare directly the real return on the bottle of wine (15 percent in our example) with the dollar return on the bond (20 percent) or to compare the dollar return on old paintings with the euro return on gold. Only after the [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) are expressed in terms of a common unit of measure—for example, all in terms of ­dollars—can we tell which asset offers the highest expected real rate of return.  

# Risk and Liquidity  

All else equal, individuals prefer to hold those assets offering the highest expected real rate of return. Our later discussions of particular assets will show, however, that “all else” often is not equal. Some assets may be valued by savers for attributes other than the expected real rate of return they offer. Savers care about two main characteristics of an asset other than its return: its risk, the variability it contributes to savers’ wealth, and its [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md), the ease with which the asset can be sold or exchanged for goods.  

1.	 Risk. An asset’s real return is usually unpredictable and may turn out to be quite different from what savers expected when they purchased the asset. In our previous example, savers found the expected real rate of return on an [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in bonds (10 percent) by subtracting from the expected rate of increase in the [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)’s dollar value (20 percent) the expected rate of increase in dollar prices (10 percent). But if [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) are wrong and the bonds’ dollar value stays constant instead of rising by 20 percent, the saver ends up with a real return of negative 10 percent ( $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=0$ percent - 10 percent). Savers dislike uncertainty and are reluctant to hold assets that make their wealth highly variable. An asset with a high expected rate of return may thus appear undesirable to savers if its realized rate of return fluctuates widely.   
2.	 [Liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md). Assets also differ according to the cost and speed at which savers can dispose of them. A house, for example, is not very liquid because its sale usually requires time and the services of brokers and inspectors. To sell a house quickly, one might have to sell at a relatively low price. In contrast, cash is the most liquid of all assets: It is always acceptable at face value as payment for goods or other assets. Savers prefer to hold some liquid assets as a precaution against unexpected pressing expenses that might force them to sell less-liquid assets at a loss. They will therefore consider an asset’s [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) as well as its [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) and risk in deciding how much of it to hold.  

# Interest Rates  

As in other [asset markets](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md), participants in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) base their demands for deposits of different currencies on a comparison of these assets’ expected rates of return. To compare [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on different deposits, market participants need two pieces of information. First, they need to know how the money values of the deposits will change. Second, they need to know how exchange rates will change so that they can translate rates of return measured in different currencies into ­comparable terms.  

The first piece of information needed to compute the rate of return on a deposit of a particular [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) is the [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)’s interest rate, the amount of that [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) an individual can earn by lending a unit of the [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) for a year. At a dollar interest rate of 0.10 (quoted as 10 percent per year), the lender of \$1 receives $\$10$ at the end of the year, $\$1$ of which is principal and 10 cents of which is interest. Looked at from the other side of the transaction, the interest rate on dollars is also the amount that must be paid to borrow $\$1$ for a year. When you buy a U.S. Treasury bill, you earn the interest rate on dollars because you are lending dollars to the U.S. government.  

[Interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) play an important role in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) because the large deposits traded there pay interest, each at a rate reflecting its [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) of denomination. For example, when the interest rate on dollars is 10 percent per year, a $\$100,000$ deposit is worth $\$123,400$ after a year; when the interest rate on euros is 5 percent per year, a €100,000 deposit is worth €105,000 after a year. Deposits pay interest because they are really loans from the depositor to the bank. When a corporation or a financial institution deposits a [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) in a bank, it is lending that [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) to the bank rather than using it for some current expenditure. In other words, the depositor is acquiring an asset denominated in the [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) it deposits.  

The dollar interest rate is simply the dollar rate of return on dollar deposits. You “buy” the deposit by lending a bank $\$100,000$ , and when you are paid back with 10 percent interest at the end of the year, your asset is worth $\$123,400$ . This gives a rate of return of $(110,000-100,000)/100,000=0.10$ , or 10 percent per year. Similarly, a foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)’s interest rate measures the foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) return on deposits of that [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). Figure 14-2 shows the monthly behavior of [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) on the dollar and the Japanese yen from 1978 to 2020. These [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) are not measured in comparable terms, so there is no reason for them to be close to each other or to move in similar ways over time.  

# Exchange Rates and Asset Returns  

The [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) offered by a dollar and a euro deposit tell us how their dollar and euro values will change over a year. The other piece of information we need in order to compare the rates of return offered by dollar and euro deposits is the expected change in the dollar/euro exchange rate over the year. To see which deposit, euro or dollar, offers a higher expected rate of return, you must ask the question: If I use dollars to buy a euro deposit, how many dollars will I get back after a year? When you answer this question, you are calculating the dollar rate of return on a euro deposit because you are comparing its dollar price today with its dollar value a year from today.  

To see how to approach this type of calculation, let’s look at the following situation: Suppose that today’s exchange rate (quoted in American terms) is $\$10$ per euro but that you expect the rate to be $\$1.165$ per euro in a year (perhaps because you expect unfavorable developments in the U.S. economy). Suppose also that the dollar interest rate is 10 percent per year while the euro interest rate is 5 percent per year. This means

# Interest Rates on Dollar and Yen Deposits, 1978–2020  

Since dollar and yen [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) are not measured in comparable terms, they can move quite differently over time.  

Source: Datastream. The figure shows three-month [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).  

a deposit of $\$1.00$ pays $\$10$ after a year while a deposit of €1 pays €1.05 after a year. Which of these deposits offers the higher return?  

You can find the answer in five steps.  

Step 1.  Use today’s dollar/euro exchange rate to figure out the dollar price of a euro deposit of, say, €1. If the exchange rate today is $\$10$ per euro, the dollar price of a €1 deposit is just $\$10$ .  

Step 2.  Use the euro interest rate to find the amount of euros you will have a year from now if you purchase a €1 deposit today. You know that the interest rate on euro deposits is 5 percent per year. So at the end of a year, your €1 deposit will be worth €1.05.  

Step 3.  Use the exchange rate you expect to prevail a year from today to calculate the expected dollar value of the euro amount determined in Step 2. Since you expect the dollar to depreciate against the euro over the coming year so that the exchange rate 12 months from today is $\$1.165$ per euro, you expect the dollar value of your euro deposit after a year to be $\$1.165$ per euro $\times\in{1.05}=\mathbb{S}1.223$ .  

Step 4.  Now that you know the dollar price of a €1 deposit today (\$1.10) and can forecast its value in a year (\$1.223), you can calculate the expected dollar rate of return on a euro deposit as $(1.223-1.10)/1.10=0.11$ , or 11 percent per year.  

Step 5.  Since the dollar rate of return on dollar deposits (the dollar interest rate) is only 10 percent per year, you expect to do better by holding your wealth in the form of euro deposits. Despite the fact that the dollar interest rate exceeds the euro interest rate by 5 percent per year, the euro’s expected appreciation against the dollar gives euro holders a prospective capital gain that is large enough to make euro deposits the higher-yield asset.  

# A Simple Rule  

A simple rule shortens this calculation. First, define the rate of depreciation of the dollar against the euro as the percentage increase in the dollar/euro exchange rate over a year. In the last example, the dollar’s expected depreciation rate is $(1.165-1.10)/1.10=0.059$ , or roughly 6 percent per year. Once you have calculated the rate of depreciation of the dollar against the euro, our rule is this: The dollar rate of return on euro deposits is approximately the euro interest rate plus the rate of depreciation of the dollar against the euro. In other words, to translate the euro return on euro deposits into dollar terms, you need to add the rate at which the euro’s dollar price rises over a year to the euro interest rate.  

In our example, the sum of the euro interest rate (5 percent) and the expected depreciation rate of the dollar (roughly 6 percent) is about 11 percent, which is what we found to be the expected dollar return on euro deposits in our first calculation.  

We summarize our discussion by introducing some notation:  
$R_{\in}=$ today>s interest rate on one@year euro deposits, $E_{\S/\in}=$ today>s dollar>euro exchange rate (number of dollars per euro), $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{e}=$ dollar>euro exchange rate (number of dollars per euro) expected to prevail a year from today.  

(The superscript $e$ attached to this last exchange rate indicates that it is a forecast of the future exchange rate based on what people know today.)  

Using these symbols, we write the expected rate of return on a euro deposit, measured in terms of dollars, as the sum of (1) the euro interest rate and (2) the expected rate of dollar depreciation against the euro:  
$$
R_{\oplus}+(E_{\S/\in}^{e}-E_{\S/\in})/E_{\S/\in}.
$$  

This [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) is what must be compared with the interest rate on one-year dollar deposits, $R_{\mathbb{S}}$ , in deciding whether dollar or euro deposits offer the higher expected rate of return.7 The expected rate of return difference between dollar and euro deposits is therefore equal to $R_{\mathbb{S}}$ less the previous expression,  
$$
\begin{array}{r}{R_{5}-[R_{\in}+(E_{\S/\in}^{e}-E_{\S/\in})/E_{\S/\in}]=R_{5}-R_{\in}-(E_{\S/\in}^{e}-E_{\S/\in})/E_{\S/\in}.}\end{array}
$$  

When the difference above is positive, dollar deposits yield the higher expected rate of return; when it is negative, euro deposits yield the higher expected rate of return.  

Table 14-3 carries out some illustrative comparisons. In case 1, the interest difference in favor of dollar deposits is 4 percent per year $(R_{\S}-R_{\in}=0.10-0.06=0.04)$ ), and no change in the exchange rate is expected $[(E_{\S/\in}^{e}-E_{\S/\in})/E_{\S/\in}=0.00]$ . This means that the expected annual real rate of return on dollar deposits is 4 percent higher than that on euro deposits, so that, other things equal, you would prefer to hold your wealth as dollar rather than euro deposits.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>TABLE 14-3</td><td colspan="4">Comparing Dollar Rates of Return on Dollar and Euro Deposits</td></tr><tr><td>Interest Rate</td><td>Dollar</td><td>Euro Interest Rate</td><td>Expected Rate of Dollar Depreciation against Euro</td><td>Rate of Return Difference between Dollar and Euro Deposits</td></tr><tr><td>Case</td><td>Rs</td><td>R</td><td>Es/E-Es/E Es/</td><td>(E/-Es/) R$-Re- Es/</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.04</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.04</td><td>0.00</td></tr><tr><td>3 4</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.06 0.12</td><td>0.08 -0.04</td><td>-0.04</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.10</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.02</td></tr></table></body></html>  

In case 2, the interest difference is the same (4 percent), but it is just offset by an expected depreciation rate of the dollar of 4 percent. The two assets therefore have the same expected rate of return.  

Case 3 is similar to the one discussed earlier: A 4 percent interest difference in favor of dollar deposits is more than offset by an 8 percent expected depreciation of the dollar, so euro deposits are preferred by market participants.  

In case 4, there is a 2 percent interest difference in favor of euro deposits, but the dollar is expected to appreciate against the euro by 4 percent over the year. The expected rate of return on dollar deposits is therefore 2 percent per year higher than that on euro deposits.  

So far, we have been translating all [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) into dollar terms. But the rate of return differentials we calculated would have been the same had we chosen to express [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) in terms of euros or in terms of some third [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). Suppose, for example, we wanted to measure the return on dollar deposits in terms of euros. Following our simple rule, we would add to the dollar interest rate $R_{\mathbb{S}}$ the expected rate of depreciation of the euro against the dollar. But the expected rate of depreciation of the euro against the dollar is approximately the expected rate of appreciation of the dollar against the euro, that is, the expected rate of depreciation of the dollar against the euro with a minus sign in front of it. This means that in terms of euros, the return on a dollar deposit is  
$$
R_{\S}-(E_{\S/\in}^{e}-E_{\S/\in})/E_{\S/\in}.
$$  

The difference between the expression above and $R_{\in}$ is identical to the right-hand side of equation (14-1). Thus, it makes no difference to our comparison whether we measure [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) in terms of dollars or euros, as long as we measure them both in terms of the same [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).  

# Return, Risk, and Liquidity in the Foreign Exchange Market  

We observed earlier that a saver deciding which assets to hold may care about the assets’ [riskiness](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Preferences.md) and [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) in addition to their expected real rates of return. Similarly, the demand for [foreign currency assets](../../China%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves/Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia/Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves.md) depends not only on [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) but also on risk and [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md). Even if the expected dollar return on euro deposits is higher than that on dollar deposits, for example, people may be reluctant to hold euro deposits if the payoff to holding them varies erratically.  

There is no consensus among economists about the importance of risk in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md). Even the definition of “foreign exchange risk” is a topic of debate. For now, we will avoid these complex questions by assuming that the real [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on all deposits have equal [riskiness](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Preferences.md), regardless of the [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) of denomination. In other words, we are assuming that risk differences do not influence the demand for [foreign currency assets](../../China%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves/Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia/Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves.md). We discuss the role of foreign exchange risk in greater detail, however, in Chapter 18.8  

[Liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) factors may influence some market participants when they decide which currencies to hold. Most of these participants are firms and individuals conducting [international trade](../../Globalization/Chapter%202-The%20Principle%20Of%20Comparative%20Advantage.md). An American importer of French fashion products or wines, for example, may find it convenient to hold euros for routine payments even if the expected rate of return on euros is lower than that on dollars. Because payments connected with [international trade](../../Globalization/Chapter%202-The%20Principle%20Of%20Comparative%20Advantage.md) make up a very small fraction of total foreign exchange transactions, we ignore the [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) motive for holding foreign currencies.  

We are therefore assuming for now that participants in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) base their demands for [foreign currency assets](../../China%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves/Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia/Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves.md) exclusively on a comparison of those assets’ expected rates of return. The main reason for making this assumption is that it simplifies our analysis of how exchange rates are determined in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md). In addition, the risk and [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) motives for holding foreign currencies appear to be of secondary importance for many of the international macroeconomic issues discussed in the next few chapters.  

# Equilibrium in the Foreign Exchange Market  

We now use what we have learned about the demand for [foreign currency assets](../../China%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves/Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia/Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves.md) to describe how exchange rates are determined. We will show that the exchange rate at which the market settles is the one that makes market participants content to hold existing supplies of deposits of all currencies. When market participants willingly hold the existing supplies of deposits of all currencies, we say that the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) is in equilibrium.  

The description of [exchange rate determination](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) given in this section is only a first step: We will be able to give a full explanation of the exchange rate’s current level only after we examine how participants in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) form their [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) about the exchange rates they expect to prevail in the future. The next two chapters look at the factors that influence [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) of future exchange rates. For now, however, we will take expected future exchange rates as given.  

# Interest Parity: The Basic Equilibrium Condition  

The [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) is in equilibrium when deposits of all currencies offer the same expected rate of return. We define the [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) condition as the requirement that the expected [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on deposits of any two currencies are equal when measured in the same [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). [Interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) is satisfied when potential holders of foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) deposits view them all as equally desirable assets, provided their expected rates of return are the same.  

Let’s see why the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) is in equilibrium only when the [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) condition holds. Suppose the dollar interest rate is 10 percent and the euro interest rate is 6 percent, but that the dollar is expected to depreciate against the euro at an 8 percent rate over a year. (This is case 3 in Table 14-3.) In the circumstances described, the expected rate of return on euro deposits would be 4 percent per year higher than that on dollar deposits. We assumed at the end of the last section that individuals always prefer to hold deposits of currencies offering the highest [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md). This implies that if the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) on euro deposits is 4 percent greater than that on dollar deposits, no one will be willing to continue holding dollar deposits, and holders of dollar deposits will be trying to sell them for euro deposits. There will therefore be an excess supply of dollar deposits and an excess demand for euro deposits in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md).  

As a contrasting example, suppose dollar deposits again offer a 10 percent interest rate but euro deposits offer a 12 percent rate and the dollar is expected to appreciate against the euro by 4 percent over the coming year. (This is case 4 in Table 14-3.) Now the return on dollar deposits is 2 percent higher. In this case, no one would demand euro deposits, so they would be in excess supply and dollar deposits would be in excess demand.  

When, however, the dollar interest rate is 10 percent, the euro interest rate is 6 ­percent, and the dollar’s expected depreciation rate against the euro is 4 percent, dollar and euro deposits offer the same rate of return and participants in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) are equally willing to hold either. (This is case 2 in Table 14-3.)  

Only when all expected rates of return are equal—that is, when the [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) condition holds—is there no excess supply of some type of deposit and no excess demand for another. The [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) is in equilibrium when no type of deposit is in excess demand or excess supply. We can therefore say that the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) is in equilibrium when, and only when, the [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) condition holds.  

To represent [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) between dollar and euro deposits symbolically, we use equation (14-1), which shows the difference between the two assets’ expected rates of return measured in dollars. The expected rates of return are equal when  
$$
R_{\S}=R_{\in}+(E_{\S/\in}^{e}-E_{\S/\in})/E_{\S/\in}.
$$  

You probably suspect that when dollar deposits offer a higher return than euro deposits, the dollar will appreciate against the euro as investors all try to shift their funds into dollars. Conversely, the dollar should depreciate against the euro when it is euro deposits that initially offer the higher return. This intuition is exactly correct. To understand the mechanism at work, however, we must take a careful look at how exchange [rate changes](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md) like these help to maintain equilibrium in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md).  

# How Changes in the Current Exchange Rate Affect Expected Returns  

As a first step in understanding how the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) finds its equilibrium, we examine how changes in today’s exchange rate affect the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) on a foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) deposit when [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) about the future exchange rate do not change. Our analysis will show that, other things equal, depreciation of a country’s [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) today lowers the expected domestic [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) return on foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) deposits. Conversely, appreciation of the domestic [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) today, all else equal, raises the domestic [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) return expected of foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) deposits.  

It is easiest to see why these relationships hold by looking at an example: How does a change in today’s dollar/euro exchange rate, all else held constant, change the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md), measured in terms of dollars, on euro deposits? Suppose today’s ­dollar/euro rate is $\$1.00$ per euro and the exchange rate you expect for this day next year is $\$1.05$ per euro. Then the expected rate of dollar depreciation against the euro is $(1.05-1.00)/1.00=0.05$ , or 5 percent per year. This means that when you buy a euro deposit, you not only earn the interest $R_{\in}$ but also get a 5 percent “bonus” in terms of dollars. Now suppose today’s exchange rate suddenly jumps up to $\$1.03$ per euro (a depreciation of the dollar and an appreciation of the euro), but the expected future rate is still $\$1.05$ per euro. What happens to the “bonus” you expected to get from the euro’s increase in value in terms of dollars? The expected rate of dollar depreciation is now only $(1.05-1.03)/1.03=0.019$ , or 1.9 percent instead of 5 percent. Since $R_{\in}$ has not changed, the dollar return on euro deposits, which is the sum of $R_{\in}$ and the expected rate of dollar depreciation, has fallen by 3.1 percentage points per year (5 percent - 1.9 percent).  

In Table 14-4, we work out the dollar return on euro deposits for various levels of today’s dollar/euro exchange rate $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}$ , always assuming that the expected future exchange rate remains fixed at $\$1.05$ per euro and the euro interest rate is 5 percent per year. As you can see, a rise in today’s dollar/euro exchange rate (a depreciation of the dollar against the euro) always lowers the expected dollar return on euro deposits (as in our example), while a fall in today’s dollar/euro exchange rate (an appreciation of the dollar against the euro) always raises this return.  

It may run counter to your intuition that a depreciation of the dollar against the euro makes euro deposits less attractive relative to dollar deposits (by lowering the expected dollar return on euro deposits) while an appreciation of the dollar makes euro deposits more attractive. This result will seem less surprising if you remember we have assumed that the expected future dollar/euro rate and [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) do not change. A dollar depreciation today, for example, means the dollar now needs to depreciate by a smaller amount to reach any given expected future level. If the expected future ­dollar/euro exchange rate does not change when the dollar depreciates today, the dollar’s expected future depreciation against the euro therefore falls, or, alternatively, the dollar’s expected future appreciation rises. Since [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) also are unchanged, today’s dollar depreciation thus makes euro deposits less attractive compared with dollar deposits.

Put another way, a current dollar depreciation that affects neither exchange rate [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) nor [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) leaves the expected future dollar payoff of a euro deposit the same but raises the deposit’s current dollar cost. This change naturally makes euro deposits less attractive relative to dollar deposits.  

It may also run counter to your intuition that today’s exchange rate can change while the exchange rate expected for the future does not. We will indeed study cases later in this book when both of these rates do change at once. We nonetheless hold the expected future exchange rate constant in the present discussion because that is the clearest way to illustrate the effect of today’s exchange rate on expected [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md). If it helps, you can imagine we are looking at the impact of a temporary change so brief that it has no effect on the exchange rate expected for next year.  

Figure 14-3 shows the calculations in Table 14-4 in a graphic form that will be helpful in our analysis of [exchange rate determination](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md). The vertical axis in the figure  

Given that $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{\mathrm{e}}=1.05$ and $R_{\in}=0.05.$ , an appreciation of the dollar against the euro raises the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) on euro deposits, measured in terms of dollars.

FIGURE 14-3 The Relation between the Current Dollar/Euro Exchange Rate and the Expected Dollar Return on Euro Deposits  

measures today’s dollar/euro exchange rate and the horizontal axis measures the expected dollar return on euro deposits. For fixed values of the expected future dollar/ euro exchange rate and the euro interest rate, the relation between today’s dollar/euro exchange rate and the expected dollar return on euro deposits defines a downwardsloping schedule.  

# The Equilibrium Exchange Rate  

Now that we understand why the [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) condition must hold for the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) to be in equilibrium and how today’s exchange rate affects the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) on foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) deposits, we can see how equilibrium exchange rates are determined. Our main conclusion will be that exchange rates always adjust to maintain [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md). We continue to assume the dollar interest rate $R_{\mathbb{S}}$ , the euro interest rate $R_{\in}$ , and the expected future dollar/euro exchange rate $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{e}$ are all given.  

Figure 14-4 illustrates how the equilibrium dollar/euro exchange rate is determined under these assumptions. The vertical schedule in the graph indicates the given level of $R_{\mathbb{S}}$ , the return on dollar deposits measured in terms of dollars. The downward-sloping schedule shows how the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) on euro deposits, measured in terms of dollars, depends on the current dollar/euro exchange rate. This second schedule is derived in the same way as the one shown in Figure 14-3.  

# Determination of the Equilibrium Dollar/Euro Exchange Rate  

Equilibrium in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) is at point 1, where the expected dollar [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on dollar and euro deposits are equal.  

![](images/bd635ff7846e84d8cd102263d86b9840fad48c1a58ce51ec6b40f20af111c600.jpg)  
FIGURE 14-4  

The equilibrium dollar/euro rate is the one indicated by the intersection of the two schedules at point $1,E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{1}$ . At this exchange rate, the [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on dollar and euro deposits are equal, so that the [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) condition (14-2),  
$$
R_{\S}=R_{\in}+(E_{\S/\in}^{e}-E_{\S/\in}^{1})/E_{\S/\in}^{1},
$$  

is satisfied.  

Let’s see why the exchange rate will tend to settle at point 1 in Figure 14-4 if it is initially at a point such as 2 or 3. Suppose first that we are at point 2, with the exchange rate equal to $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{2}$ . The downward-sloping schedule measuring the expected dollar return on euro deposits tells us that at the exchange rate $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{2}$ , the rate of return on euro deposits is less than the rate of return on dollar deposits, $R_{\mathbb{S}}$ . In this situation, anyone holding euro deposits wishes to sell them for the more lucrative dollar deposits: The [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) is out of equilibrium because participants such as banks and multinational corporations are unwilling to hold euro deposits.  

How does the exchange rate adjust? The unhappy owners of euro deposits attempt to sell them for dollar deposits, but because the return on dollar deposits is higher than that on euro deposits at the exchange rate $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{2}$ , no holder of a dollar deposit is willing to sell it for a euro deposit at that rate. As euro holders try to entice dollar holders to trade by offering them a better price for dollars, the dollar/euro exchange rate falls toward $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{1}$ ; that is, euros become cheaper in terms of dollars. Once the exchange rate reaches $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{1}$ , euro and dollar deposits offer equal [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md), and holders of euro deposits no longer have an incentive to try to sell them for dollars. The [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) is therefore in equilibrium. In falling from $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{2}$ to $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{1}$ , the exchange rate equalizes the expected [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on the two types of deposit by ­increasing the rate at which the dollar is expected to depreciate in the future, thereby making euro deposits more attractive.  

The same process works in reverse if we are initially at point 3 with an exchange rate of $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{3}$ . At point 3, the return on euro deposits exceeds that on dollar deposits, so there is now an excess supply of the latter. As unwilling holders of dollar deposits bid for the more attractive euro deposits, the price of euros in terms of dollars tends to rise; that is, the dollar tends to depreciate against the euro. When the exchange rate has moved to $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{1}$ , rates of return are equalized across currencies and the market is in equilibrium. The depreciation of the dollar from $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{3}$ to $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{1}$ makes euro deposits less attractive relative to dollar deposits by reducing the rate at which the dollar is expected to depreciate in the future.9  

# Interest Rates, Expectations, and Equilibrium  

Having seen how exchange rates are determined by [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md), we now take a look at how current exchange rates are affected by changes in [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and in [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) about the future, the two factors we held constant in our previous discussions.  

We will see that the exchange rate (which is the relative price of two assets) responds to factors that alter the expected rates of return on those two assets.  

# The Effect of Changing Interest Rates on the Current Exchange Rate  

We often read in the newspaper that the dollar is strong because U.S. [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) are high or that it is falling because U.S. [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) are falling. Can these statements be explained using our analysis of the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md)?  

To answer this question, we again turn to a diagram. Figure 14-5 shows a rise in the interest rate on dollars, from $R_{\mathbb{S}}^{1}$ to $R_{\mathbb{S}}^{2}$ as a rightward shift of the vertical dollar deposits return schedule. At the initial exchange rate $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{1}$ , the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) on dollar deposits is now higher than that on euro deposits by an amount equal to the distance between points 1 and $1^{\prime}$ . As we have seen, this difference causes the dollar to appreciate to $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{2}$ (point 2). Because there has been no change in the euro interest rate or in the expected future exchange rate, the dollar’s appreciation today raises the expected dollar return on euro deposits by increasing the rate at which the dollar is expected to depreciate in the future.  

Figure 14-6 shows the effect of a rise in the euro interest rate $R_{\in}$ . This change causes the downward-sloping schedule (which measures the expected dollar return on euro deposits) to shift rightward. (To see why, ask yourself how a rise in the euro interest rate alters the dollar return on euro deposits, given the current exchange rate and the expected [future rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Rate.md).)  

At the initial exchange rate $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{1}$ , the expected depreciation rate of the dollar is the same as before the rise in $R_{\in}$ , so the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) on euro deposits now exceeds that  

# FIGURE 14-5  

# Effect of a Rise in the Dollar Interest Rate  

A rise in the interest rate offered by dollar deposits from $R_{\mathbb{S}}^{1}$ to $R_{\mathbb{S}}^{2}$ causes the dollar to appreciate from $E_{\Phi/\in}^{1}$ (point 1) to $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{2}$ (point 2).

on dollar deposits. The dollar/euro exchange rate rises (from $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{1}$ to $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{2})$ to eliminate the excess supply of dollar assets at point 1. As before, the dollar’s depreciation against the euro eliminates the excess supply of dollar assets by lowering the expected dollar rate of return on euro deposits. A rise in European [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) therefore leads to a depreciation of the dollar against the euro or, looked at from the European perspective, an appreciation of the euro against the dollar.  

Our discussion shows that, all else equal, an increase in the interest paid on deposits of a [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) causes that [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) to appreciate against foreign currencies.  

Before we conclude that the newspaper account of the effect of [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) on exchange rates is correct, we must remember that our assumption of a constant expected future exchange rate often is unrealistic. In many cases, a change in the expected future exchange rate will accompany a change in [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md). This change in the expected future exchange rate will depend, in turn, on the economic causes of the interest rate change. We compare different possible relationships between [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and expected future exchange rates in Chapter 16. Keep in mind for now that in the real world, we cannot predict how a given interest rate change will alter exchange rates unless we know why the interest rate is changing.  

# The Effect of Changing Expectations on the Current Exchange Rate  

We may also use Figure 14-6 to study the effect on today’s exchange rate of a rise in the expected future dollar/euro exchange rate, $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{e}$ .  

Given today’s exchange rate, a rise in the expected future price of euros in terms of dollars raises the dollar’s expected depreciation rate. For example, if today’s exchange rate is $\$1.00$ per euro and the rate expected to prevail in a year is $\$1.05$ per euro, the expected depreciation rate of the dollar against the euro is $(1.05-1.00)/1.00=0.05$ ; if the expected future exchange rate now rises to $\$1.06$ per euro, the expected depreciation rate also rises, to $(1.06-1.00)/1.00=0.06$ .  

Because a rise in the expected depreciation rate of the dollar raises the expected dollar return on euro deposits, the downward-sloping schedule shifts to the right, as in Figure 14-6. At the initial exchange rate $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{1}$ , there is now an excess supply of dollar deposits: Euro deposits offer a higher expected rate of return (measured in dollar terms) than do dollar deposits. The dollar therefore depreciates against the euro until equilibrium is reached at point 2.  

We conclude that, all else equal, a rise in the expected future exchange rate causes a rise in the current exchange rate. Similarly, a fall in the expected future exchange rate causes a fall in the current exchange rate.

# What Explains the Carry Trade?  

Over much of the 2000s, Japanese yen [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) were close to zero (as ­Figure  14-2 shows) while Australia’s [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) were comfortably positive, climbing to over 7 percent per year by the spring of 2008. While it might therefore have appeared attractive to borrow yen and invest the proceeds in Australian dollar bonds, the [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) condition implies that such a strategy should not be systematically profitable: On average, shouldn’t the interest advantage of Australian dollars be wiped out by relative appreciation of the yen?  

Nonetheless, market actors ranging from Japanese housewives to sophisticated [hedge funds](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) did in fact pursue this strategy, investing billions in Australian dollars and driving that [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)’s value up, rather than down, against the yen. More generally, international investors frequently borrow low-interest currencies (called “funding” currencies) and buy high-interest currencies (called “[investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)” currencies), with results that can be profitable over long periods. This activity is called the [carry trade](../../../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md), and while it is generally impossible to document the extent of [carry trade](../../../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) positions accurately, they can become very large when sizable international interest differentials open up. Is the prevalence of the [carry trade](../../../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) evidence that [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) is wrong?  

The honest answer is that while [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) does not hold exactly in ­practice— in part because of the risk and [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) factors mentioned earlier—economists are still working hard to understand if the [carry trade](../../../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) requires additional explanation. Their work is likely to throw further light on the functioning of foreign exchange markets in particular and [financial markets](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) in general.  

One important hazard of the [carry trade](../../../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) is that [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) currencies (the high-interest currencies that carry traders target) may experience abrupt crashes. Figure 14-7 illustrates this feature of foreign exchange markets, comparing the cumulative return to investing $\yen100$ in yen bonds and in Australian dollar bonds over different [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) horizons, with the initial [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) being made in the first quarter of 2006. As you can see, the yen [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) yields next to nothing, whereas Australian dollars pay off handsomely at almost every horizon, not only because of a high interest rate but because the yen tended to fall against the ­Australian dollar through the summer of 2008. But in 2008, the Australian dollar crashed against the yen, falling in price from $\yen100$ to only $\yen65$ between July and December. Anyone who got into the business after mid-2009, however, consistently did better in Australian dollars. And anyone savvy enough to unwind the strategy in June 2008 could have made nearly a 40 percent return in about two and a half years rather than taking a sizable loss over three. The [carry trade](../../../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) is obviously a very risky business.  

![](images/d94ef326605a55aaa9b9469f01e7bb8c6403c66fdfe6568c49626add92a2b18e.jpg)  
FIGURE 14-7  

# Cumulative Total Investment Return in Australian Dollars Compared with Japanese Yen, 2006–2020  

The Australian dollar-yen [carry trade](../../../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) has been profitable on average but is subject to sudden large reversals, as in 2008.  

Source: Quarterly Japanese yen/Australian dollar exchange rate, 90-day Australia bank bill rate, and 90-day Japan certificate of deposit rate from FRED database. The chart compares the cumulative value over time of a $\yen100$ [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in Japanese interest-bearing 90-day bonds, rolled over every quarter, with the same yen [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) converted into Australian dollars, invested in 90-day Australian bonds and rolled over every quarter, and then converted back into yen at the end of the [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) period.  

We can gain some insight into this pattern by imagining that investors expect a gradual 1 percent annual appreciation of the Australian dollar to occur with high probability (say, 90 percent) and a big 40 percent depreciation to occur with a 10 percent probability. Then the expected appreciation rate of the Australian dollar is:  

The negative expected appreciation rate means that the yen is actually expected to appreciate on average against the Australian dollar, which is at least qualitatively consistent with [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md). However, the probability of an Australian dollar crash occurring in the first six years of the [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is only $1\mathrm{~-~}(0.9)^{6}=1\mathrm{~-~}0.53\mathrm{~=~}47$ percent, less than fifty-fifty.10 The resulting pattern of cumulative [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) could easily look much like the one shown in Figure 14-7. Calculations like these are suggestive, and although they are unlikely to explain the full magnitude of [carry trade](../../../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md), researchers have found that [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) currencies are particularly subject to abrupt crashes and funding currencies to abrupt appreciations.11  

Complementary explanations based on risk and [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) considerations have also been advanced. Often, abrupt [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) movements occur during financial crises, which are situations in which other wealth is being lost and liquid cash is particularly valuable. In such circumstances, large losses on [carry trade](../../../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) positions are extra painful and may force traders to sell other assets they own at a loss.12 We will say much more about crises in later chapters, but we note for now that the Australian dollar collapse of late 2008 occurred in the midst of a severe [global financial crisis](../../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md).  

When big [carry trade](../../../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) positions emerge, the government officials responsible for international economic policies often lose sleep. In their early phase, [carry trade](../../../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) dynamics will drive [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) currencies higher as investors pile in and build up ever-larger exposures to a sudden depreciation of those currencies. This makes the crash bigger when it occurs, as wrong-footed investors all scramble to repay their funding loans. The result is greater exchange rate volatility in general as well as the possibility of big trader losses with negative repercussions in stock markets, bond markets, and markets for interbank loans.  

# Forward Exchange Rates and Covered Interest Parity  

We have seen that the [forward exchange rate](../../../Financial%20Engineering/A%20Primer%20on%20Currency%20Derivatives.md) moves closely with the [spot rate](../../The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md), but it has great importance in its own right, both as an indicator of [market expectations](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Rate.md) and as a key price linking money markets in different currencies. In this section we will show that under the assumption that the [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) condition always holds, a [forward exchange rate](../../../Financial%20Engineering/A%20Primer%20on%20Currency%20Derivatives.md) equals the [spot exchange rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Review%20Session%20Notes/Arbitrage%20Opportunity%20Accounting.md) expected to prevail on the [forward contract](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md)’s value date. We will also show how forward rates can connect national money markets closely even if [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) does not hold and introduce (although not resolve) a market puzzle that has emerged since the [global financial crisis](../../../Financial%20Engineering/8.%20Credit%20Modeling%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) that broke out in 2007–2008.  

As the first step in the discussion, we point out the close connection among the [forward exchange rate](../../../Financial%20Engineering/A%20Primer%20on%20Currency%20Derivatives.md) between two currencies, their [spot exchange rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Review%20Session%20Notes/Arbitrage%20Opportunity%20Accounting.md), and the [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) on deposits denominated in those currencies. The connection is described by the [covered interest parity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Interest%20Rates,%20Carry%20Trades,%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) (CIP) condition, which is similar to the (uncovered) [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) (UIP) condition defining [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) equilibrium but involves the [forward exchange rate](../../../Financial%20Engineering/A%20Primer%20on%20Currency%20Derivatives.md) rather than the expected future [spot exchange rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Review%20Session%20Notes/Arbitrage%20Opportunity%20Accounting.md).  

To be concrete, we again consider dollar and euro deposits. Suppose you want to buy a euro deposit with dollars but would like to be certain about the number of dollars it will be worth at the end of a year. You can avoid [exchange rate risk](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/PSET%203%20Financial%20Instruments.md) by buying a euro deposit and, at the same time, selling the proceeds of your [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) forward. When you buy a euro deposit with dollars and at the same time sell the principal and interest forward for dollars, we say you have “covered” yourself, that is, avoided the possibility of an unexpected depreciation of the euro.  

The [covered interest parity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Interest%20Rates,%20Carry%20Trades,%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) condition states that the rates of return on dollar deposits and “covered” foreign deposits must be the same. An example will clarify the meaning of the condition and illustrate why it must always hold. Let $F_{\mathbb{S}/\in}$ stand for the one-year [forward price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) of euros in terms of dollars, and suppose $F_{\mathbb{S}/\in}=\mathbb{S}1.113$ per euro. Assume that at the same time, the [spot exchange rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Review%20Session%20Notes/Arbitrage%20Opportunity%20Accounting.md) is $E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}=1.05$ per euro, $R_{\mathbb{S}}=0.10$ , and $R_{\in}=0.04$ . The (dollar) rate of return on a dollar deposit is clearly 0.10, or 10 percent, per year. What is the rate of return on a covered euro deposit?  

We answer this question as we did in the chapter. A €1 deposit costs $\$1.05$ today, and it is worth $\epsilon1.04$ after a year. If you sell €1.04 forward today at the forward exchange rate of $\$123$ per euro, the dollar value of your [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) at the end of a year is (\$1.113 per euro) $\times(\in1.04)=\mathbb{S}1.158.$ . The rate of return on a covered purchase of a euro deposit is therefore $(1.158-1.05)/1.05=0.103.$ . This 10.3 percent per year rate of return exceeds the 10 percent offered by dollar deposits, so [covered interest parity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Interest%20Rates,%20Carry%20Trades,%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) does not hold. In this situation, no one would be willing to hold dollar deposits; everyone would prefer covered euro deposits. In other words, market [pricing](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) would present an [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) opportunity.  

More formally, we can express the covered return on euro deposits as  
$$
\frac{F_{\mathbb{S}/\in}(1+R_{\in})-E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}}{E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}},
$$  

which is approximately equal to  
$$
R_{\oplus}+\frac{F_{\mathbb{S}/\in}-E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}}{E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}}
$$  

when the product $R_{\oplus}\times(F_{\mathbb{S}/\in}-E_{\mathbb{S}/\in})/E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}$ is a small number. The [covered interest parity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Interest%20Rates,%20Carry%20Trades,%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) condition can therefore be written  
$$
R_{\S}=R_{\in}+(F_{\mathbb{S}/\in}-E_{\mathbb{S}/\in})/E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}.
$$  

The quantity  
$$
(F_{\mathbb{S}/\in}-\mathrm{\Delta}E_{\mathbb{S}/\in})/E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}
$$  

is called the forward premium on euros against dollars. (It is also called the forward discount on dollars against euros.) Using this terminology, we can state the [covered interest parity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Interest%20Rates,%20Carry%20Trades,%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) condition as follows: The interest rate on dollar deposits equals the interest rate on euro deposits plus the forward premium on euros against dollars (the forward discount on dollars against euros).  

Up until the late 2000s, the [covered interest parity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Interest%20Rates,%20Carry%20Trades,%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) condition held very closely for different foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) deposits issued within a single financial center.13 Deviations from [covered interest parity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Interest%20Rates,%20Carry%20Trades,%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) could occur, however, if the deposits being compared were located in different countries. For example, deviations could arise if asset holders feared that governments might impose regulations to prevent the free movement of foreign funds across national borders. Our derivation of the [covered interest parity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Interest%20Rates,%20Carry%20Trades,%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) condition implicitly assumed there was no political risk of this kind—a good description of current conditions in advanced economies.  

Deviations can occur also because of fears that banks will fail, making them unable to pay off large deposits, or that the counterparties to forward exchange transactions will not make good on their commitments to deliver currencies. For these reasons, big deviations from [covered interest parity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Interest%20Rates,%20Carry%20Trades,%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) emerged around the time of the worldwide [banking](../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) crisis that started in 2007–2008.14 Figure 14-8 illustrates this development by graphing the difference between dollar interbank [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and the covered return to investing in three foreign interbank markets, measured in basis points (a basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point).  

Surprisingly, however, CIP did not reestablish itself after the 2007–2008 crisis passed, as Figure 14-8 also shows, even though banks and other market participants became financially stronger. In general, the deviations in Figure 14-8 tend to be negative, implying that it would be profitable to [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) by borrowing dollars, selling them for foreign currencies, and then investing the proceeds in foreign money markets while selling the

# U.S. Dollar Three-Month Interest Rate Less Covered Rate on Three-Month ­Foreign Bank Deposits  

[Covered interest parity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Interest%20Rates,%20Carry%20Trades,%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) held well up until the [financial crisis](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) that started in 2008, but it has not held closely since then. The three non-U.S. [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) currencies shown are the euro, pound, and yen.  

proceeds forward to complete the round trip out of dollars and back. In important research, Wenxin Du of the University of Chicago, Alexander Tepper of Columbia University, and Adrien Verdelhan of the Massachusetts Institute of ­Technology have shown that the reason for the recent breakdown of CIP is almost certainly not a fear of default by parties to CIP transactions.15 Nonetheless, potential market arbitrageurs seem unwilling (or lack the borrowing capacity) to exploit fully potentially profitable CIP trades. The reasons behind this apparent puzzle are important for understanding current conditions in [financial markets](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md), and we will discuss them further in Chapter 20.  

By comparing the uncovered [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) (UIP) condition,  
$$
R_{\S}=R_{\in}+(E_{\S/\in}^{e}-E_{\S/\in})/E_{\S/\in},
$$  

with the [covered interest parity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Interest%20Rates,%20Carry%20Trades,%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) condition, you will find that both conditions can be true at the same time only if the one-year [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) quoted today equals the [spot exchange rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Review%20Session%20Notes/Arbitrage%20Opportunity%20Accounting.md) people expect to materialize a year from today:  
$$
F_{\mathbb{S}/\in}=E_{\mathbb{S}/\in}^{e}.
$$  

This makes intuitive sense. When two parties agree to trade foreign exchange on a date in the future, the exchange rate they agree on is the [spot rate](../../The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) they expect to prevail on that date. The important difference between covered and uncovered transactions should be kept in mind, however. Covered transactions do not involve [exchange rate risk](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/PSET%203%20Financial%20Instruments.md), whereas uncovered transactions do. This important distinction means that the simple equality between forward rates and expected future spot rates need not hold in theory; Chapter 18 will take this topic up. And as we have noted, UIP does not seem to hold in practice either, for reasons we will explore in Chapter 20.  

The theory of [covered interest parity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Interest%20Rates,%20Carry%20Trades,%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) helps explain the close correlation between the movements in spot and forward exchange rates shown in Table 14-1, a correlation typical of all major currencies. The unexpected economic events that affect expected [asset returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%201%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Overview/Some%20Stylized%20Empirical%20Facts%20About%20Asset%20Retur.md) often have a relatively small effect on international interest rate differences between deposits with short maturities (for example, three months). To maintain CIP, therefore, [spot and forward rates](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) for the corresponding maturities must change roughly in proportion to each other.  

We conclude this section with one further application of the [covered interest parity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Interest%20Rates,%20Carry%20Trades,%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) condition. To illustrate the role of forward exchange rates, the chapter used the example of an American importer of Japanese radios anxious about the $\S/\yen12$ exchange rate it would face in 30 days when the time came to pay the supplier. In the example, Best Buy solved the problem by selling forward for yen enough dollars to cover the cost of the radios. But Best Buy could have solved the problem in a different, more complicated way. It could have (1) borrowed dollars from a bank; (2) sold those dollars immediately for yen at the [spot exchange rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Review%20Session%20Notes/Arbitrage%20Opportunity%20Accounting.md) and placed the yen in a 30-day yen bank deposit; (3) then, after 30 days, used the proceeds of the maturing yen deposit to pay the Japanese supplier; and (4) used the realized proceeds of the U.S. radio sales, less profits, to repay the original dollar loan.  

Which course of action—the forward purchase of yen or the sequence of four transactions described in the preceding paragraph—is more profitable for the importer? We leave it to you, as an exercise, to show that the two strategies yield the same profit when the [covered interest parity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Interest%20Rates,%20Carry%20Trades,%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) condition holds.  

■■ An exchange rate is the price of one country’s [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) in terms of another country’s [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). Exchange rates play a role in spending decisions because they enable us to translate different countries’ prices into comparable terms. All else equal, a depreciation of a country’s [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) against foreign currencies (a rise in the home [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) prices of foreign currencies) makes its exports cheaper and its imports more expensive. An appreciation of its [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) (a fall in the home [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) prices of foreign currencies) makes its exports more expensive and its imports cheaper.  

■■ Exchange rates are determined in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md). The major participants in that market are commercial banks, international corporations, nonbank [financial institutions](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md), and national central banks. Commercial banks play a pivotal role in the market because they facilitate the exchange of interest-bearing bank deposits, which make up the bulk of foreign exchange trading. Even though foreign exchange trading takes place in many financial centers around the world, modern communication technology links those centers together into a single market that is open 24 hours a day. An important category of foreign exchange trading is forward trading, in which parties agree to [exchange currencies](../../../Clippings/Currency%20Swap%20Basics.md) on some future date at a prenegotiated exchange rate. In contrast, spot trades are settled immediately.  

■■ Because the exchange rate is the relative price of two assets, it is most appropriately considered as being an [asset price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) itself. The basic principle of [asset pricing](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing.md) is that an asset’s current value depends on its expected future purchasing power. In evaluating an asset, savers look at the expected rate of return it offers, that is, the rate at which the value of an [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in the asset is expected to rise over time. It is possible to measure an asset’s expected rate of return in different ways, each depending on the units in which the asset’s value is measured. Savers care about an asset’s expected real rate of return, the rate at which its value expressed in terms of a representative output basket is expected to rise.  

■■ When relative [asset returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%201%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Overview/Some%20Stylized%20Empirical%20Facts%20About%20Asset%20Retur.md) are relevant, as in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md), it is appropriate to compare expected changes in assets’ [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) values, provided those values are expressed in the same [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). If risk and [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) factors do not strongly influence the demands for [foreign currency assets](../../China%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves/Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia/Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves.md), participants in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) always prefer to hold those assets yielding the highest expected rate of return. ■■ The [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on deposits traded in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) depend on [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and expected exchange [rate changes](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md). To compare the expected rates of return offered by dollar and euro deposits, for example, the return on euro deposits must be expressed in dollar terms by adding to the euro interest rate the expected rate of depreciation of the dollar against the euro (or rate of appreciation of the euro against the dollar) over the deposit’s holding period.  

■■ Equilibrium in the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) requires [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md); that is, deposits of all currencies must offer the same expected rate of return when [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) are measured in comparable terms.  

■■ For given [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and a given expectation of the future exchange rate, the [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) condition tells us the current equilibrium exchange rate. When the expected dollar return on euro deposits exceeds that on dollar deposits, for example, the dollar immediately depreciates against the euro. Other things equal, a dollar depreciation today reduces the expected dollar return on euro deposits by reducing the depreciation rate of the dollar against the euro expected for the future. Similarly, when the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) on euro deposits is below that on dollar deposits, the dollar must immediately appreciate against the euro. Other things equal, a current appreciation of the dollar makes euro deposits more attractive by increasing the dollar’s expected future depreciation against the European [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).  

■■ All else equal, a rise in dollar [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) causes the dollar to appreciate against the euro while a rise in euro [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) causes the dollar to depreciate against the euro. Today’s exchange rate is also altered by changes in its expected future level. If there is a rise in the expected future level of the dollar/euro rate, for example, then at unchanged [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md), today’s dollar/euro exchange rate will also rise.  

■■ [Interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md), spot exchange rates, and forward exchange rates must conform to the [covered interest parity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Interest%20Rates,%20Carry%20Trades,%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) (CIP) condition if [arbitrage opportunities](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md) between money markets for different currencies are absent. CIP differs from the (uncovered) [interest parity](../../Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) condition (UIP) that underlies our theory of [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) equilibrium unless forward exchange rates equal expected future spot rates. As we will discuss in future chapters, this last condition need not always be satisfied, and even CIP itself has not held closely in recent years.

1.	 In Delhi, a haircut costs 135 rupees (INR). The same haircut costs 15 Singapore dollars (SGD) in Singapore. At an exchange rate of $50\mathrm{INR}$ per SGD, what is the price of an Indian haircut in terms of a Singapore haircut? Keeping all else equal, how does this relative price change if the INR depreciates to 55 INR per SGD? Compared to the initial situation, does a Singapore haircut become more or less expensive in relation to an Indian haircut?  

2.	 As defined in footnote 3, cross exchange rates are exchange rates quoted against currencies other than the U.S. dollar. If you return to Table 14-1, you will notice that it lists not only exchange rates against the dollar, but also cross rates against the euro and the pound sterling. The fact that we can derive the Swiss franc/Israeli shekel exchange rate, say, from the dollar/franc rate and the dollar/shekel rate follows from ruling out a potentially profitable [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) strategy known as triangular [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md). As an example, suppose the Swiss franc price of a shekel were below the Swiss franc price of a dollar times the dollar price of a shekel. Explain why, rather than buying shekels with dollars, it would be cheaper to buy Swiss francs with dollars and use the francs to buy the shekels. Thus, the hypothesized situation offers a [riskless profit opportunity](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Cash-And-Carry%20Arbitrage.md) and therefore is not consistent with profit maximization.  

3.	 Table 14-1 reports exchange rates not only against the U.S. dollar, but also against the euro and the pound sterling. (Each row gives the price of the dollar, euro, and pound, respectively, in terms of a different [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).) At the same time, the table gives the spot dollar prices of the euro (\$1.1219 per euro) and the pound sterling (\$1.2597 per pound). Pick any five currencies from the table and show that the three quoted spot exchange rates (in terms of dollars, euros, and pounds) approximately rule out triangular [arbitrage](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md). Why do we need to add the word “approximately”?  

4.	 Petroleum is sold in a world market and tends to be priced in U.S. dollars. The Phosphate Group of Morocco must import petroleum to produce fertilizer and other chemicals. How are its profits affected when the Dirham (Moroccan [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)) depreciates against the dollar?  

5.	 Calculate the euro rates of return on the following assets:  

a.	 A painting whose price rises from €200,000 to €250,000 in a year.   
b.	 A diamond whose price rises from €20 000 to €21 000 between 2014 and 2015.   
c.	 A £10,000 deposit in a London bank in a year when the interest rate on pounds is 2 percent and the $\textstyle\in/\operatorname{\mathbb{E}}$ exchange rate moves from €1.36 per pound to 1.17 per pound.  

6.	 What would be the real rates of return on the assets in the preceding question if the price changes described were accompanied by a simultaneous 10 percent increase in all dollar prices?  

7.	 Suppose the Mexican peso (MXN) interest rate and the Indian rupee (INR) interest rate are the same, 5 percent per year. What is the relation between the current equilibrium MXN/INR exchange rate and its expected future level? Suppose the expected future MXN/INR exchange rate, $3.40\ \mathrm{INR}$ per Mexican peso, remains constant as India’s interest rate rises to 10 percent per year. If the Mexican interest rate also remains constant, what is the new equilibrium MXN/INR exchange rate?  

8.	 Traders in [asset markets](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) suddenly learn that the interest rate on dollars will decline in the near future. Use the diagrammatic analysis of this chapter to determine the effect on the current dollar/euro exchange rate, assuming current [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) on dollar and euro deposits do not change.   
9.	 We noted that we could have developed our diagrammatic analysis of [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) equilibrium from the perspective of Europe, with the euro/­dollar exchange rate $E_{\in/\mathfrak{s}}(=1/E_{\mathfrak{s}/\in})$ on the vertical axis, a schedule vertical at $R_{\in}$ to indicate the euro return on euro deposits, and a downward-sloping schedule showing how the euro return on dollar deposits varies with $E_{\in/\updownarrow}$ . Derive this alternative picture of equilibrium and use it to examine the effect of changes in [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and the expected future exchange rate. Do your answers agree with those we found earlier?   
10.	 A report appeared in the Financial Times on 18 January, 2016, noted that the South Korean Finance Minister had voiced confidence in China’s economic outlook, and had declared that “he endorsed Beijing’s predictions of a ‘soft landing,’ ­saying Seoul expected China’s economy to grow between 6 percent and 7 percent this year.” a.	 In your opinion, why was the South Korean Minister so concerned about China’s “soft landing?” b.	 Do you think that the rate of exchange of the Won/RMB is a factor in this “soft landing?”   
11.	 Suppose the dollar exchange rates of the euro and the yen are equally variable. The euro, however, tends to depreciate unexpectedly against the dollar when the return on the rest of your wealth is unexpectedly high, while the yen tends to appreciate unexpectedly in the same circumstances. As a European resident, which [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) the dollar or the yen, would be considered riskier?   
12.	 Does any of the discussion in this chapter lead you to believe that dollar deposits may have [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) characteristics different from those of other [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) deposits? If so, how would the differences affect the interest differential between, say, dollar and Mexican peso deposits? Do you have any guesses about how the [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) of euro deposits may be changing over time?   
13.	 In October 1979, the U.S. central bank (the [Federal Reserve System](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Fed%20Fund%20Futures.md)) announced it would play a less active role in limiting fluctuations in dollar [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md). After this new policy went into effect, the dollar’s exchange rates against foreign currencies became more volatile. Does our analysis of the [foreign exchange market](../../Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md) suggest any connection between these two events?   
14.	 The central bank of a country announces it would play a less active role in limiting fluctuations in its [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md). Do you think that the exchange rate of its [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) will become more volatile? Why?   
15.	 Take the two currencies—South African Rand (ZAR) and Indonesia Naira (NGN). Suppose the one-year [forward exchange rate](../../../Financial%20Engineering/A%20Primer%20on%20Currency%20Derivatives.md) is $23\mathrm{NGN}$ per ZAR and the [spot exchange rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Review%20Session%20Notes/Arbitrage%20Opportunity%20Accounting.md) is $20\thinspace\mathrm{NGN}$ per ZAR. What is the forward premium on NGN (the forward discount on ZAR)? What is the difference between the interest rate on one-year ZAR deposits and that on one-year NGN deposits (assuming no repayment risk)?   
16.	 Europe’s single [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md), the euro, was introduced in January 1999, replacing the currencies of 11 European Union members, including France, Germany, Italy, and Spain (but not Britain; see Chapter 21). Do you think that, immediately after the euro’s [introduction](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Introduction.md), the value of foreign exchange trading in euros was greater or less than the euro value of the pre-1999 trade in the 11 original national currencies? Explain your answer.   
17.	 Multinationals generally have production plants in a number of countries. ­Consequently, they can move production from expensive locations to cheaper ones in response to various economic developments—a phenomenon called outsourcing when a domestically based firm moves part of its production abroad. If the dollar depreciates, what would you expect to happen to outsourcing by American companies? Explain and provide an example.  

18.	 In the beginning of 2015, the interest rate of some currencies are the following:

a.	 What are in theory the best [carry trade](../../../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) cases?   
b.	 If you take in account the exchange rate variation risk, what [carry trade](../../../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) operation will you favor? Explain.
