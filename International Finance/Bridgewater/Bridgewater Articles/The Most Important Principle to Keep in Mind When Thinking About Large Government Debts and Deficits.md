It is:

**When countries have too much debt, lowering interest rates and devaluing the currency that the debt is denominated in is the preferred path government policy makers are most likely to take, so it pays to bet on it happening.**

At the moment of my writing, we know that the projections are for big deficits and big increases in government debt and debt service expenses ahead. (You can see these numbers in my writings, including my new book *How Countries Go Broke: The Big Cycle*; I also shared last [week](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-trip-washington-get-sync-republican-democratic-leaders-ray-dalio-vylye/?trackingId=1u9jBj7sSyWtLRzseRP18Q%3D%3D) why I believe the political system in the US won’t be able to get its debt problems under control). We know how debt service costs (paying back interest and principal) will grow rapidly to squeeze out spending, and we also know that, at best, it is highly doubtful that there will be an increase in demand for the debt commensurate with the supply that needs to be sold. I laid out in detail what I think the implications of all this are in *How Countries Go Broke*, where I offer a description of the mechanics behind my thinking. Others have stress tested it, and thus far there has been almost total agreement that the picture I am painting is accurate. Of course, that doesn’t mean that I can’t be wrong. It’s up to you to decide what’s likely true. I am just giving you and others my thinking to assess.

**My Principles**

As I explained, based on the experiences I have had and the research I have done over the last 50+ years of investing, I have developed and written down principles that help me anticipate events so that I can successfully bet on them. I am now at a stage in my life in which I want to pass along these principles to help others. Also, I believe that in order to understand what is happening and what’s likely to happen, one needs to understand how the mechanics work, so I am also trying to explain my understanding of the mechanics behind the principl
