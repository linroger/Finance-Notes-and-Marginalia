It is:

**When countries have too much debt, lowering interest rates and devaluing the currency that the debt is denominated in is the preferred path government policy makers are most likely to take, so it pays to bet on it happening.**

At the moment of my writing, we know that the projections are for big deficits and big increases in government debt and debt service expenses ahead. (You can see these numbers in my writings, including my new book *How Countries Go Broke: The Big Cycle*; I also shared last [week](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-trip-washington-get-sync-republican-democratic-leaders-ray-dalio-vylye/?trackingId=1u9jBj7sSyWtLRzseRP18Q%3D%3D) why I believe the political system in the US won’t be able to get its debt problems under control). We know how debt service costs (paying back interest and principal) will grow rapidly to squeeze out spending, and we also know that, at best, it is highly doubtful that there will be an increase in demand for the debt commensurate with the supply that needs to be sold. I laid out in detail what I think the implications of all this are in *How Countries Go Broke*, where I offer a description of the mechanics behind my thinking. Others have stress tested it, and thus far there has been almost total agreement that the picture I am painting is accurate. Of course, that doesn’t mean that I can’t be wrong. It’s up to you to decide what’s likely true. I am just giving you and others my thinking to assess.

**My Principles**

As I explained, based on the experiences I have had and the research I have done over the last 50+ years of investing, I have developed and written down principles that help me anticipate events so that I can successfully bet on them. I am now at a stage in my life in which I want to pass along these principles to help others. Also, I believe that in order to understand what is happening and what’s likely to happen, one needs to understand how the mechanics work, so I am also trying to explain my understanding of the mechanics behind the principles. Here are a few more principles along with the explanations of how I believe the mechanics work. I believe that the following are true and good principles:

- **The most hidden way, hence the most preferred and common way, for government policy makers to deal with having too much debt is to lower both real interest rates and real currency rates.**
- **While lowering interest and currency rates in response to too much debt and the problems it creates can be a short-term palliative, it can reduce demand for the currency and the debt and create longer-term problems because it reduces the returns of holding the currency/debt, which reduces the value of the debt as a storehold of wealth. And over time, it usually leads to higher debts since the lower real interest rates are stimulative, making the problem worse.**

**In summary, when there is too much debt, interest rates and currency rates tend to be driven down.**

Is that good or bad for economic conditions?

It’s both, tending to be good and well-received in the short term but bad and leading to worse problems down the road. Lowering real interest rates and real currency exchange rates is…

… **beneficial over the short term** because it is stimulative and tends to lift asset prices…

…while it is…

… **detrimental over the intermediate and long term** because a) it gives holders of these assets lower real returns (because of the currency devaluation and the lower yield), b) it produces higher inflation rates, and c) it leads to greater debt.

In any case, it certainly doesn’t avoid the painful consequences of overspending and getting deeper into debt. Here are the mechanics of how it works:

**When interest rates fall, borrower-debtors benefit** because it reduces debt service costs, making it cheaper to borrow and buy things, which raises investment asset prices and stimulates growth. That’s why most everyone is happy with lowering interest rates over the short term.

But at the same time,**those price increases hide the bad consequences of lowering interest rates to undesirably low levels, which is detrimental to lenders and creditors**. These things are true because reducing interest rates (most importantly real interest rates), including central banks pushing bond yields down, raises the prices of bonds and most other assets, which leads to lower future returns (for example, when interest rates went to negative levels, bond prices went up). It also leads to more debt, which creates bigger debt problems down the road. So, lender-creditors get less return on the debt assets they hold, and more debt is created.

**Lower real interest rates also tend to lower the real value of the currency** because it makes the currency/credit yield lower relative to other countries’ alternatives. That brings me to my explanation of how lowering currency rates is the preferred and most common way for government policy makers to deal with having too much debt.

- **Lower currency rates are preferred and seem good when explained by policy makers to their constituents for two reasons:**

1) Lower currency exchange rates make countries’ goods and services less expensive relative to those from countries that have rising currencies, so they stimulate economic activity and foster rising asset prices (particularly in nominal terms), and…

2) …they make it easier to pay off debt in a way that is more painful to foreigners holding the debt assets than for the countries’ own citizens. That is because the alternative “hard money” approach requires tighter money and credit, which keeps real interest rates higher, which constricts spending and typically means painful service cuts and/or tax increases and tougher lending conditions that citizens don’t like. In contrast, as I will explain below, lower currency rates are a “hidden” way of paying debts because most people don’t realize that their wealth is going down.

- **A lower currency rate also typically raises the value of foreign assets when looked at through the lens of the depreciated currency.**

For example, if the dollar devalues by 20% percent, US investors will be able to pay foreign holders of dollar-denominated debt with money that is worth 20% less (i.e., the foreign holders of the debt assets will have currency losses of 20%). What is less apparent and harmful about a weaker currency is that those with the weaker currency have less buying power and borrowing power—less buying power because their currency goes less far and less borrowing power because buyers of debt assets don't want to buy debt assets (i.e., promises to receive money) or money when they believe the value of the money the debt is denominated in (and the money itself) is going down. The reason this isn’t apparent is because most people in the country whose currency is being devalued (e.g., Americans dealing in dollars) don’t see their buying power and wealth decline because they measure the value of their assets in their own currency, which gives the illusion that their assets are going up even though the currency they are valued in is going down. For example, if the dollar falls by 20%, US investors won’t directly see that they lost 20% in their buying power of foreign goods and services if they focus only on the fact that the assets they own have gone up in dollars. However, for foreign holders of US dollar-denominated debt, it will be obvious and painful. As they increasingly worry about this, they hedge (sell) the currency that the debt is in and/or sell out of the debts, leading to more weakness in the currency and/or the debt.

In summary,**looking only through the lens of one’s own currency clearly creates a distorted perspective. For example, if the price of something** (e.g., gold) goes up by 20% in dollars, we see that as the price of that thing going up rather than the value of dollars going down. The fact that most people have this distorted perspective is what makes these ways of dealing with having too much debt “hidden” and more politically acceptable than the alternatives.

This way of looking at things has changed a lot over the years, especially from when people were accustomed to there being a gold-backed monetary system to today when they are used to a fiat/paper money monetary system (i.e., one in which money is not backed by gold or any hard asset, which became the case after Nixon de-linked the dollar from gold in 1971). When money existed as paper notes that were claims on gold (let’s call this gold-backed money), people viewed the value of paper money as rising and falling. Its value almost always fell, and the only question was whether it fell faster than the interest rates one received by holding the fiat currency in a debt instrument. Now that the world has gotten used to viewing prices through the lens of fiat/paper money, they have the reverse view—they view the prices of things going up rather than the value of money going down.

Because a) the prices of things in gold-backed money and b) the quantity of gold-backed money have historically been much more stable than a) the prices of things in fiat/paper money and b) the quantity of fiat/paper money, I think that viewing the prices of things in gold-backed money is probably the more accurate way to view things. Apparently, central banks have a similar perspective because gold has become the second largest money (reserve asset) that they own after dollars and ahead of euros and yen, partly for these reasons and partly because gold is at less risk of being confiscated.

**The magnitude of the declines in the fiat currency and the real interest rate as well as the magnitude of the gains in the non-fiat monies (e.g., gold, bitcoin, silver, etc.) have historically been, and logically should be, a function of their relative supplies and demands.**For example, big debts that can’t be supported with hard money lead to big easings of money and credit, which lead to big declines in both real interest rates and the real currency rates. The most recent major period when this happened was during the stagflationary period from 1971 until 1981, and it caused big shifts in wealth, financial markets, economies, and political circumstances. Based on the existing sizes of debts and deficits (not only in the US, but also in most fiat-currency countries), the potential for similar very big shifts exists in the years ahead.

Regardless of whether that is right or not, it appears indisputable that the magnitudes of the debt and budget issues are very large. In such times, it’s good to have hard money. As of now and for many centuries across the world, gold has been hard money. Much more recently, some cryptocurrencies have been viewed as hard currencies. For reasons I won’t digress into again, I prefer gold, though I do have some crypto.

**How Much Gold Should One Have?**

While I’m not trying to give you advice on specific investments, I will share the principles that help inform my perspective on this question. When thinking about what amount of gold relative to bonds I want to have, I think of their relative supplies and demands and the relative costs and returns of holding them. For example, with Treasury bonds now giving about a 4.5% interest rate and gold giving a 0% interest rate, it is logical to prefer to hold gold if one thinks its price will rise by more than 4.5% over the next year—and illogical to own gold if one doesn’t think it will rise by 4.5%. To help me make that assessment, I look at the supplies and demands for both.

I also know that gold and bonds diversify each other, so I think about how much of each I should have for good risk control, and I know that a gold holding of roughly 15% can be an effective diversifier over time in that it produces a better return/risk ratio for the portfolio. Inflation-linked bonds do the same, so it is worth considering adding both to a typical portfolio.

I am sharing this perspective with you rather than telling you what I think the markets will do or suggesting exactly how much of each asset you should have because my goal is to “teach you how to fish rather than give you fish.”

PS- If you would like a much more complete view of my investment thinking, I will refer you to this course on my Investment and Economic Principles created by [Singapore’s Wealth Management Institute](https://wmi.edu.sg/dmp-online/). I promise you that you can easily learn these principles and that they will prove invaluable in your understanding of what’s going on and what’s likely to happen—and what that means for your investment approach. 100% of the people who have taken it said that they would recommend it to others.
