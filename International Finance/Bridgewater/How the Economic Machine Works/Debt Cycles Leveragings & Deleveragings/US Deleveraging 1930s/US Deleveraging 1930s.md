# US Deleveraging 1930s

This document provides a timeline for the U.S. Deleveraging in the 1930s. I wrote it in a way to both make clear important cause and effect relationships and to convey an up-close feeling of what it was like to go through the experience as an investor. As a result, sometimes you will read about market action in detail that has no historical importance but provides perspective for investors trying to navigate such moves. For example, throughout this period there were giant market whip-saws and swings in sentiment that misled and hurt many. Also, the waves of destruction in asset values that occurred through changing market values and asset confiscations were enormous. So it is important that we, as managers of our clients' wealth, visualize how we would have navigated these changes. Only by going through this experience virtually, as well as going through the other deleveragings (the Weimar Republic in the 1920s, Latin America in the 1980s and Japan in the 1990s) and testing our strategies can we be confident that we can successfully navigate the next few years.

This timeline is meant to be read with frequent reference to the accompanying charts that show all markets and stats that I believe are important. Facts and notes for the timeline were taken from several books shown in the bibliography in the back.

# Preface

Money serves two purposes – it is a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth. So it serves two masters – 1) those who want to obtain it for "life's necessities," usually by working for it and 2) those who have the value of their stored wealth tied to its value. Throughout history these two groups have been called different things – e.g., the first group has been called workers, the proletariat, and "the have-nots" and the second group has been called capitalists, investors, and "the haves." For simplicity, I will call the first group workers and the second group investors. They, along with the government (which sets the rules), are the major players in this drama for money.

Like many dramas, this one both arises and transpires in ways that have reoccurred through time, going back to before Roman times. One man's financial assets are another man's financial liabilities (i.e., promises to deliver money). When the claims of financial assets are too high relative to the money available to meet them, a deleveraging arises. In the last couple of centuries, this happened when the ability to increase financial assets, most importantly credit, has been impaired because monetary policy is dysfunctional, often because interest rates are at 0% and can't be lowered further. As a result, the claims (i.e., financial wealth) need to fall relative to what they are claims on (i.e., money). This happens through extinguishing the claims (e.g., bankruptcies) and/or increasing the supply of money.

This *fundamental imbalance* between the size of the claims on money and the supply of money has occurred many times in history and has always been resolved in some mix of the two previously mentioned ways. This resolution process is painful for all of the players. In fact, the pain has sometimes been so bad that some civilizations turned against the capitalist system (i.e., the system based on this type of capital formation). For example, some historians say that the problems that arose from credit creation were why charging interest was a sin of usury in both the Catholic Church as well as in the Arab religions. Throughout the Middle Ages, no Christian could charge interest to another Christian, so the Jews played a large part in the development of trade because it was the Jews who lent money for business ventures and financed voyages. But the Jews were also moneylenders who debtors could not repay, and this often led to anti-Semitism. Supposedly, much of the killing of Jews was caused by them holding the mortgages on property and creditors wanting to extinguish the debts. Debtor-creditor relationships have typically turned very antagonistic in these fights for money and many other patterns of human behavior that are important to know about regularly surfaced during these dramatic times. Other relationships and the actions of various players were comparably noteworthy. So it is very important for us to read these historic dramas.

The Great Depression is probably the greatest such drama in recorded history. It is certainly a classic that must be studied by anyone who cares about wealth preservation and the well-being of society. Additionally, it is the Dprocess that is most similar to the current dynamic because it was the last global deleveraging.

# Conditions in 1929 Leading up to the Crash

As long as there has been money and it has been lent, the biggest issue has been the value of the money. Since being paid back with goods (e.g., wheat) doesn't work well for many reasons, debts are typically denominated in money, but lenders need some assurances that governments won't just print up a lot of it and devalue their claims. In the 1920's, these assurances were made by governments promising to exchange their money for gold at a fixed exchange rate. In other words, the world was on a gold standard back then. This played an important role in determining how events transpired in the 1920's, leading up to the crash, but I won't get into that now. The important thing to know is that the world was on a gold standard then.

1929 was a year of spectacular economic growth10 which was great for both workers and investors. The unemployment rate was down to less than 1%, which was the lowest since 1920, and corporate profits were the highest that they had ever been. The stock market's strength seemed to benefit everyone. Credit was readily available which allowed a lot of borrowing to buy stocks, houses, investment assets and many other things at high prices. Prior years were similar, though less extreme.

Stockbrokers fueled the rapid expansion of their business by offering easy credit terms.11 The call loan market, a relatively new and rapidly growing market, rose rapidly, quite like the securitized debt market grew in 2005-07. The diversion of funds to invest in the call loan market by corporations, foreigners, and individuals reflected a speculation in credit, motivated by attractive interest rates, that fueled the speculative mania in stocks of the period in much the same way the carry trade did in 2006-2007.12

Stocks sold at extremely high multiples financed by borrowing (i.e., margin). Many stocks were valued as much as 30 to 50 times earnings. Then money started to tighten. In May 1928, the Federal Reserve System began tightening credit, raising its discount rate to 4 ½%. It was raised again to 5% in July 1928 and to 6% in August 1929.13

Required margin deposits also rose before the crash. Most brokers became concerned about the extent of their margin loans at the high stock prices and in the face of higher interest rates in midsummer of 1929. So brokers began to raise the margin requirements on loans from 10%-25% to 50% by the Crash.14 Also, prior to the Crash, brokers tried to reduce their call loan exposure on margin accounts.

Banks were strong going into the Crash and not over-leveraged. The leading banks had great strength because they had deposits that were not more than seven times their capital and surplus. This was a conservative ratio, especially when only 60% of bank assets were typically in loans and up to one-third of those were call loans, which were short-term.15

In August, the Fed eased a bit16 because the economy slowed in reaction to the earlier tightening, so production peaked in most industries in the first half of the year, before the Crash.17

The peak in the market occurred on the first trading day in September, at 381 on the Dow Jones Industrial Index. Keep this price in mind as we will track the Dow's level through this timeline. Most people were bullish at the time, but a few notable, knowledgeable and independent thinkers gave warnings. For example, Roger Babson had

# "become shrill" in predicting the coming collapse of prices because of "tight money," so he recommended selling stocks in September and again in October.

In the first week of October there was a big drop in stock prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Index declined in two days from 344 to 325, or 6%. Margin calls were numerous. 18 Some brokers were rumored to be in trouble because of the heavy slate of initial public offerings which continued unabated. But, in the second week of October, prices bounced back to 352, though they soon started to slip again.

It became widely known that big margin calls and sell orders existed on October 24th, so everyone who worked on the exchange was alerted to be prepared. Then the collapse and panic came. There was a tidal wave of panic, not a gradual loss of confidence. The streets of the financial district were in an uproar from shortly after the opening of the Exchange as investors heard of the disaster and, unable to gain information through normal channels, went to the Exchange to seek information firsthand.

An attempt to stabilize the market was made by a small group of the biggest bankers known as "the Bankers' Pool," who committed to buy \$125 million in shares at about 12:00 noon. At midday Richard Whitney, the president of the Exchange, went on to the floor to the post for U.S. Steel and bid \$205 for 25,000 shares (over \$5 million) and other members of the pool behaved similarly. This caused a big bounce in the stock market. The leading stocks had been down 15%-20%, but they bounced early as fast as they had gone down. Professionals, speculators, and coolheaded investors bought aggressively as they believed that we had seen a correction that was a great buying opportunity. The Dow Jones Industrial Index bounced back 26 points from a low for the day of 272 (down 33) to close at 299 (down 6).19 This classic pattern of big moves to support the market leading to big accompanying bounces would repeat numerous times throughout the bear market.

At the end of Black Thursday, a second organized effort to help the market was formed by a group of brokers. Some 35 leading brokers accounting for 70% of NYSE business assembled at the offices of Hornblower & Weeks and agreed that the worst was over and that they should act to reassure their customers. They took out a full page ad in the *New York Times* the next day, confidently telling the public that it was a great time to buy.20 This would not be the last time that those who listened to the confident advice of their brokers and advisors would be misled. Prices started to slide again. Over the weekend, margin calls went out and foreign banks were reported to be switching out of brokers call loans and buying bankers acceptances, to seek safety. At the same time, prices were bid up for U.S. government and high grade railroad bonds, as investors sought safety.

On Monday night, margin calls were enormous, and heavy Dutch and German selling came in overnight for the Tuesday morning opening. On Tuesday morning, out-of-town banks and corporations pulled \$150 million of call loans and Wall Street was in a panic before the Exchange opened.21 The Fed responded, as central banks typically do in such circumstances, by providing liquidity. The immediate problem to be dealt with by the Federal Reserve and the New York City banks was the collapse of the call loan market,22 as it withdrew the credit that investors had used to fund their positions. So, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York bought \$25 million in U.S. securities to inject funds into the banking system so the banks could increase their call loans.23

Once again, opportunistic buying came into the market and the market rallied in the last 15 minutes of Tuesday, October 29th, triggering optimism.24 Nonetheless, the combined decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Index for Monday and Tuesday was 20%. So, the contraction in wealth and the problems of leveraged holders of assets had begun.

### On Wednesday morning, October 30th, the stock market opened strong. The NYSE announced after Wednesday's close that trading on Thursday, October 31st, would begin at noon and that the Exchange would close on Friday and Saturday to catch up on paperwork.

Then the Federal Reserve Bank of New York cut its discount rate from 6% to 5% in coordination with the Bank of England, which cut its bank rate from 6 ½% to 6%.25 Classically, the announcements stimulated strong buying when the exchange opened, but not enough to cause prices to go to new highs. So the rally didn't last, as leveraged longs were being squeezed.

Stocks continued to plunge the next week, starting with a stampede to sell when the NYSE opened on Monday, November 4th. On Tuesday the exchanges were closed for Armistice Day. On Wednesday, November 6th, the stock markets opened with heavy selling. Stocks continued to fall the next week.26

The Crash helped high grade and railroad bonds and hurt BAA and other lower quality bonds. The yields on BAA industrial and utility bonds dropped a little, in contrast to high grade bonds, so that the yield spreads between BAA and AA bonds became the widest in 1929.

Municipal bonds constituted one of the larger securities markets in 1929, second only to the U.S. government bond market. In 1929 the municipal bond market behaved much like the corporate bond market. Bond prices declined enough to raise yields by ¼% to ½%, a progression throughout the year in response to the investor surge into the stock market and tightening short-term credit conditions and then prices rose and yields declined during the Crash as investors leaving the stock market created a strong demand for high quality municipals.

However, some regions where there was a financial bubble, such as Florida, were already in default. More Florida defaults were anticipated, including a default by Miami, whose bonds yielded 5.75%, 1% above any other major city's bonds.

On Wednesday, November 13th, John D. Rockefeller placed a bid for 1 million shares of Standard Oil (N.J.) at \$50, down \$33 from its 1929 high of \$83. Then, the administration felt that it had to do something so, after the close on November 13th, Treasury Secretary Mellon announced that the United States would reduce corporate and individual income taxes by 1% to stimulate confidence, and they prohibited short selling. In response to these moves and to stocks appearing cheap, the market bottomed on November 14th and rallied 25% through December.27

Most everyone thought the problems were over and many regretted not buying when prices were cheap. Speculators resumed their past activities. The Chairman of the Chase National Bank reinvested heavily in stocks. William Durant created a new pool in Radio Corp. of America stock. The Chairman of General Theatres Equipment, Inc., organized a new pool in his own company's 6% convertible debentures with Chase Securities, etc.28

### Government Policies

Herbert Hoover had been president only seven months when the Crash occurred. The day after the Crash he issued his famous statement: "The fundamental business of the country, that is production and distribution of commodities, is on a sound and prosperous basis."

Contrary to what is popularly believed, the Hoover Administration was prompt and positive in its reaction to the Crash. For example, Hoover arranged for a committee of 400 businessmen to advise the President on business

25 Wigmore p. 19 26 Wigmore p. 22 27 Wigmore p. 25 28 Wigmore p. 25

conditions. It was led by a "Committee of 72", which was made up of men who seemed like titans in the business and social world of the 1920s,29 so it consisted of the best of the best. The Hoover Administration hoped that the Crash would destroy excessive speculation but not the economy,30 much the same way the Bush administration viewed the initial declines as a healthy correction of speculative excesses. The federal government also expanded its public works plans to \$250 million for 1930. This constituted the most active and direct role in the economy taken by the federal government in generations, and the policy appeared to work.

Also, Hoover's policy supported the Federal Reserve in its policy of credit easing.31 President Hoover's attack on the impending Depression, together with the easy money that the Fed provided, were generally expected to produce an economic upswing by mid-1930.

As mentioned, the Fed eased aggressively when the crash occurred. The day before Black Thursday the New York Federal Reserve reduced its buying rate for bankers acceptances from 5 1/8% to 5%. Then, during the Crash, the New York Federal Reserve reduced its discount rate from 6% to 5% on November 1st and to 4 ½% on November 15th. On the same dates, it reduced its buying rate for bankers acceptances to 4 ¾% and 4 ¼%. Another reduction to 4% on November 21st prevailed until January 31st, 1930.32

# 1H1930 Optimism Returns

In 1930 it was widely believed that the stock market action had had a 50% correction33 that was over, largely because those sorts of moves are what people remembered.

A number of well-known analysts pointed to value and earnings as reasons why the market was fundamentally sound. Then, like now, people remembered past cyclical downturns, especially those in 1920, 1914 and 1907, and pointed out that 50% corrections occurred in these cases and that the worst was over back in 1920 within 130 days of the top. However, the reasons for the various panics prior to 1929 were different. In some cases, panics were caused by drastic declines in the gold reserves prompting a lack of confidence in government's ability to meet its debts with sound money, which sent capital fleeing from banks into safe securities and even into hoarding gold. In other cases, panic was created by natural disasters which seriously disrupted the cash flow between various sectors of the United States, sparking bank failures which gave rise to the birth of the Federal Reserve.34 The optimism wasn't just confined to market participants. All the Federal Reserve districts predicted an upturn in the economy in the second half of 1930. The commercial banks also forecast an upturn. So, in 1H1930, optimism prevailed.

The banking system was considered strong at the time.35 Loans and investments of all member banks expanded steadily through 1930. Their investments in U.S. government securities, municipals, railroad bonds, utility bonds, and foreign bonds all expanded throughout the year, and the new-issue market for common stocks recovered, too.36

From the depths of the panic in late 1929, the market had begun to recover moving through the first quarter of 1930.37 The stock market rose strongly in the first four months of 1930. For those who still had money, 1930 held the opportunity for a killing.38 Stocks seemed cheap because they fell faster than the economy, so prices

 29 Wigmore p. 89-90 30 Wigmore p. 89-90 31 Wigmore p 113 32 Wigmore p. 96 33 Armstrong p. 242 34 Armstrong p. 337 35 Wigmore p. 116 36 Wigmore p. 119 37 Armstrong p. 242 38 Wigmore p.137

were low in relation to earnings. For example, AT&T was only off 0.1% in earnings, yet the stock price was 25% lower than at the 1929 high.39 Outside Wall Street, industry looked strong. So in the first quarter of 1930 it was widely believed that stocks were clearly in a 50% correction and nothing more,40 so stocks rose as the Fed eased and the Hoover administration was responsive to the problems.41 On March 31, Congress passed a stimulus package called the Public Buildings Act and on April 4 approved an appropriation for state road building projects in order to help stimulate the economy.

Bonds remained steady during January and February despite the Fed's cut in the discount rate during February, but in March they rallied in response to a second cut to 3.5%. The Fed had cut the discount rate from 6% to 3.5% in just seven months in an attempt to halt the decline in the economy. Interest rates plummeted straight down during the first quarter of 1930.42

As mentioned, the Fed bought a lot of T-Bills following the crash and until March 1930. Additionally, it is noteworthy that the Directors of the New York Fed and its professional staff wanted to buy a lot of U.S. government bonds to prevent the decline in Federal Reserve credit resulting from the decline in the Federal Reserve's bill holdings. However, the Federal Reserve Board in Washington opposed the New York bank's requests, fearing that it would scare foreign investors and weaken the dollar.43

For all these reasons, optimism ran fairly high during the first quarter of 1930.44 By April 10th, the Dow had rallied back up to 293.36. But poor earnings reports continued. In that sense, the stock market action, economic activity, Fed moves and the administration's moves were broadly similar to those in 2008 and early 2009. In other words, despite monetary and fiscal stimulation and a general sense that stocks had gotten cheap and the economy was in a normal contraction, economic weakness persisted and dragged stocks lower.

# 2H7930 Trade Wars, Economic Weakness, Financial Losses, and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act

The economic weakness was global as well as domestic. During this second quarter of 1930 world trade and production declined and unemployment increased. <sup>45</sup>Even with a big fiscal stimulus (about 1% of GDP), and the Fed easing, the world economy weakened. Naturally (i.e., typical of bad downturns) trade tensions and protectionist sentiment emerged. In the U.S., it was widely argued that industries would rebound as long as Europe was forced to stop its dumping policies. While workers and capitalists in industries that had to compete with imports generally liked tariffs, foreigners and those who traded or dealt in world markets didn't. As the week of June 16 began. the news of what would become known as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act weighed on the stock market <sup>46</sup>even though it raised by tariffs by only 20%. Though workers liked tariffs, investors did not. On Monday, June 16th, stocks gapped down. The Dow Jones industrials plummeted to 212.27, closing the week at 215.30.<sup>47</sup>The selling pressure continued the following week as the industrials fell to 207.74, off 14.9% from the close of June 14.

The Senate and the House passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff bill on June 17, raising U.S. tariffs by 20% on average, making U.S. tariffs the highest in the world. Several other countries immediately did the same. 48

To convey how tariffs changed over time, most importantly how they increased in economic bad times, we show the following interesting chart that we stumbled across. Protectionism is an almost certain consequence of economic bad times.

Armstrong p. 260 Armstrong p. 258 Armstrong p. 260 Wigmore p. 115

## It is a mistake to attribute the deleveraging to the Smoot-Hawley tariff,49 as U.S. exports as a percentage of GDP in terms of constant dollars were only 5.28% in 1929 and declined to 4.44% in 1931, so they were rather small and declined a bit more than proportionally with the total economy. The economic contraction which took place worldwide was primarily created by the asset bubble bursting and the debt crisis emerging.

Hoover planned a fiscal 1931 budget surplus, but the likelihood of a surplus diminished as 1930 progressed. In the fiscal year ending June 1931 there was a budget deficit of \$463 million because of a \$1 billion decline in federal receipts. Increasing budget deficits in periods of economic hardship are virtually inevitable.

# The Real Economy Deteriorates

In the second half of 1930, the economy weakened.50 Then, as now, auto production dropped to about 50% of capacity and the commodities-based industries, such as the oil, mining, farm equipment, and pulp and paper industries, suffered declines.51 In less than two quarters steel production utilization dropped from 95% to 60% of capacity and commodities prices fell sharply. Housing and mortgage debt collapsed.52 Classically, these industries decline as the demand for discretionary durables, oil and commodities used in production declines.

On September 9, 1930, President Hoover stopped all immigration with the exception of tourists, students and professional men and women, and the Labor Department was also instructed to rigidly enforce the laws against illegal aliens, so in 1930 thousands of deportations were made.53 Moves to curtail immigration and to force immigrants to leave the country are also typical of deleveragings.

At the end of the year the index of prices for 47 farm products was down 29.3% from pre-Crash prices, and publicly traded industrial commodities averaged a price decline of approximately 25%. Hoover declared that speculators who sold commodities short were conspiring against the public welfare.54 Demonizing those who made money betting on the decline is also typical of deleveragings.

In 1930, earnings declined. According to a survey by Moody's taken of the first 744 companies to report on their 1930 earnings, there was a 23.2% average decline in corporate earnings in comparison to 1929's strong earnings. But this average figure is a bit misleading because of differences. Of the total, half were industrial corporations, which posted a decline in earnings of 35.9% for 1930,55 while other industries such as utilities (including the telephone and telegraph companies) were unaffected. In fact, through most of 1930, many industries were not yet doing all that badly as consumer spending did not drop off that sharply at this point. So, the 1930s fall in earnings looked like a shallow recession.

The chart below shows department store sales. Notice how they slipped, but did not collapse, in 1930.

June was the worst month for the stock market in 1930. The Dow Jones Industrial Index dropped almost 23%,56 commodities prices broke their lowest levels since 1914 and the Smoot-Hawley tariff was passed. Lowering money rates and reducing brokers loans had no effect.57 Then, as now, the Treasury bond market was strong while credit spreads widened.58

The stock market stabilized for the summer months, though the news was bad – e.g., Miami defaulted, Warner Bros. and Shell Union Oil halted their dividends, and the budget deficit outlook worsened.59

However, the majority of market analysts began to turn bullish during August of 1930 and prices rallied to a peak of 247 on September 10th, though the economy continued to slide and liquidity fears60 were beginning to arise. Once again, market participants over-anticipated a recovery that didn't materialize, and the disappointing reality of the economy drove prices lower.

Railroads then were like autos now, in that they had problems rolling their maturing debts and faced large rollovers ahead (in 1931) and the government considered providing them with special loans because they were considered to be an essential industry that was too important to allow to fail. For this reason, the story of the railroads during the Great Depression is worth noting for those trying to anticipate the fate of the autos over the next few years.

Then, like in 2008, despite a severe decline in government interest rates, corporate bonds eventually collapsed61 as public confidence gave way and mortgage spreads to treasuries increased. Specifically, interest rates on first mortgages stayed at 5.5% to 6% while seconds yielded at least 7%, because despite the decline in government rates, banks were still maintaining high rates on mortgages62 because of the increased credit risks and the banks fears of illiquidity. Municipal bonds and municipal governments did well in 1930 until credit fears developed in the last quarter.63

In October of 1930, the stock market broke its November 1929 lows.64

### Bank Failures Begin

During the Crash and in 1930, there was a lot of talk about the strength of the banking system and the strength of the banks was expected to limit the duration of the contraction. Bank earnings generally declined only 25%-30% in 1930, and four of the top ten banks paid higher dividends in 1930. So, banks appeared strong through most of 1930.65

However, some banks began to look vulnerable when the economy and stock market weakened late in 1930. The decline in the stock market in the second half of 1930 made some banks especially vulnerable because they owned stocks.66 Also, some important banks had also engaged in unsound speculation and made unsound loans. Other banks were affected by the impact of declining commodities prices on their customers' credit and by the worsening economic conditions.md), particularly those banks that had large real estate loans. Runs eventually occurred in numerous cities during 1930. However, the majority of early bank failures were confined to banks in the Midwest and country banks that had a lot of money in real estate loans.67

Many bankers had liquidity problems because they held many illiquid foreign bonds, real estate loans, railroad loans, and investment loans, so they sought safety and liquidity in the short-term market then, in much the same was as they did in 2008 and early 2009. During the first six months of 1930, 471 banks failed, though none of the big ones.

Then, like now, the velocity of money fell as credit contracted and people moved to holding cash. The hoarding of gold coins began to increase by late 1929 as the government stopped issuing new gold coinage.68

Through all of 1930, 1,350 banks suspended operations, compared with 659 banks in 1929,69 but bank failures weren't a big worry.70 Also, Wall St. brokerage firms started failing.71 Financial companies which had employed high leverage in 1929 paid a heavy price for it in 1930.72 Goldman Sachs Trading wrote down its portfolio value \$165 million at the end of 1930 in order to bring it to market value. Then, as now, almost half the write-offs were on securities for which no adequate public market existed.73 Also, investment funds at the Wall Street firms began to collapse as managers lost most of their clients' money. For example, Goldman Sachs' two leading funds both fell by about 90%.

It wasn't until December 1930 that bank failures became a big deal. Until then, the majority of bank failures had been in the Midwest. But in December, the Bankers Trust Co. in Philadelphia failed, which was followed by the failure of the Bank of United States.74 Manufacturers Trust Company also experienced runs at some branches and needed help from the Clearing House Association. Bank stocks plunged. The reputations of U.S. banks suffered abroad, where the Bank of United States was thought to be more important than it actually was because of its name.75

Back then, there was no active lender-of-last-resort role at the Federal Reserve to deal with smaller regional banks, so the Bank of United States got no lender-of-last-resort loans. The Federal Reserve did what its role proscribed when bank suspensions accelerated in November and December 1930, i.e., it increased its open

market purchases aggressively, so that its holdings of T-bills doubled by December 31st. 76 Back then, the role of the Federal Reserve was to control money supply and not to determine who got money and who didn't. Political shifts follow economic shifts. This time was no different. The Democrats swept Congress in the November mid-term elections. Still, at the end of 1930, a majority of those in finance and business predicted that there would be an economic recovery in 1931.77

### International Problems

The foreign debt problem had also become a big drag on the global economy, which hurt the U.S. economy. Then, as now, these debts were heavily denominated in U.S. dollars. Then, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board privately advised Hoover to cut war debts by 70% and reparations by 40% to improve international trade and financial conditions, but this was rejected because it was felt that the U.S. needed the money.78 All the countries of Western Europe and the United Kingdom had dollar-denominated bond issues after the war and, in varying degrees, were facing problems coming up with dollars, which then, as this time around, strengthened the dollar.

In the boom years, emerging market debt had become popular as it seemed to offer higher interest rates with not much risk. Issues of South American governments had been especially popular. For example, Argentine bonds were rated Aa by Moody's, which also gave an A bond rating to Buenos Aires, Chile, Cuba, Peru, Rio Grande do Sul, and Uruguay. Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and Rio de Janeiro were rated Baa, which still implied investment quality. Rates on these bonds were 1%-2% over comparably rated domestic corporate issues in 1928-1929 when the carry trade was popular.79 But in 1930, U.S. investors didn't want to roll over maturing foreign debt.80 Foreign governments with maturing issues had to resort to short-term borrowing. Then, as now, these countries didn't get loans from the U.S. government. Later in the deleveraging, many of these countries defaulted on their U.S. bond issues.

France and Great Britain were heavily in debt to the United States, but the greatest source of instability was Germany, which had built up massive international short-term debts that it could not service or roll. Germany had a huge reparations burden, it lacked foreign exchange reserves, the savings of individuals had been wiped out by hyperinflation in the early 1920s, and the rest of Europe feared a rebirth of German militarism so it tried to hold Germany back economically. Since hyperinflation and reparations payments eliminated domestic savings, both German industry and government were forced to borrow abroad.81 As it was short of cash, Germany's central bank, the Reichsbank, raised its rate from 4% to 5% in October in order to raise short-term funds.82 By this time Hitler had emerged on the scene and created a problem for the governing Social Democrats, thus destabilizing their ability to govern, making investors more wary about lending to Germany.

Similarly, economic problems in South America caused political and social problems there. In September there was a revolt in Chile and a revolution in Argentina and in October a rebel coup in Brazil.83 Naturally, this turbulence scared investors both foreign and domestic, and this scared capital away, worsening their problems!

During such times of great stress, political and social polarization emerges as various strongly held opposing views, especially of "the have-nots" (workers) and "the haves" (investors), and this makes it difficult for leaders to govern. Such periods are great test of whether a nation's system of checks and balances really works or paralyzes decision making.

# 1Q1931

Still, in January 1931, most people confidently expected an imminent recovery. For example, at their January 1931 annual meetings, virtually all bank chairmen predicted a business recovery during 1931. So did politicians, financiers, businessmen, and even Europeans, who had been the most skeptical of similar predictions in early

### 1930.84 This is because the problems still seemed manageable, so there was a presumption that there would be a return to this norm.

February 1931 was a month of mixed economic data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied sharply during February as confidence returned. For three weeks prior to Washington's Birthday, stocks rose and there were stories of big bears caught short and big M&A deals rumored. International Telephone & Telegraph gained 100% from its January low and there were rumors that it would again attempt to buy Radio Corp's communication business. These developments worried investors with cash and shorts that that they'd miss out on the return to normalcy, so they bought, causing a buying panic. Optimism was pervasive and broadly expressed. The Dow Jones Industrials rallied 20% from the December low and selected stocks doubled,85 so there was no doubt that the economy was on the road to recovery.

On stocks, the head of Chase bank commented: "I do not know whether we shall see lower prices in the stock market or not…There are many securities, both stocks and bonds, which are now selling for less than they will be worth in normal times and at prices which should prove attractive to the investor." His conclusion and forecast were: "I think that we are approximately at the worst of the Depression and that the next important move will be upward…I expect conditions at the end of 1931 to be a good deal better than they are at the end of 1930."86 In January, even Paul Moritz Warburg, who had become somewhat of a respected soothsayer for identifying the "speculative orgy" just prior to the collapse and who was a well-known banker and a director of the Manhattan Co., said "from the banker's point of view, I do not hesitate to say that within a few years hence the level at which some of our securities sell today will look…incomprehensibly low…even though one might anticipate a year or two of reduced dividends."87

Similarly, the President of U.S. Steel, James Augustine Farrell, was quoted in *Time* magazine saying that stocks had reached "the low from which an uptrend was now in motion" and the chairman of both RCA and General Electric, Owen D. Young, stated before the American Bankers Association meeting that in his opinion improvement was at hand. Numerous leaders within industry echoed these opinions. Also, in February 1931 the Federal Reserve Board declared that the banking system was much stronger than 18 months earlier. At the same time, state and local governments were generally considered strong and creditworthy.

Investors shared this view, and the Dow Jones Industrials rallied into February, exceeding the January high as well as the highs that had been established during both November and December of 1930.88 The chart below shows the rally and what subsequently happened. Once again, sentiment affected stock prices and the economy, and knowledgeable people confidently gave misleading advice that sucked people with cash into the market and shorts out of the market, hurting both. I point this out to show how misleading a consensus of experts and market movements can be.89

#### Along with the rally in stocks, railroad bonds rallied in February, exceeding the highs of December 1930 and January 1931. Corporate and municipal bond defaults started to pick up in 1931.90 Real estate backed bonds were one of the worst investments, second only to foreign bonds. **<sup>91</sup>**Interestingly, bond defaults caused more losses than stock market declines in the Depression. In fact, supposedly losses on investments in foreign bonds were greater than losses on investments in stocks. <sup>92</sup>Stocks, at least, could be sold at a price quoted on the exchange.

Bond issues backed by real estate simply went into default and were illiquid.

# Wages and Consumer Finance

At this time, there were greatly divergent views about how to solve the Depression. For example, some people thought that wages should be pushed up and others thought they should fall. For example, the president of the Chase National Bank, which was the largest bank in the U.S. at the time, Albert Wiggins, said "it is not true that high wages make prosperity. Instead, prosperity makes high wages. Many industries may reasonably ask labor to accept a reduction of wages designed to reduce costs and to increase both employment and the buying power of labor." <sup>93</sup>Others argued that by lowering wages it would reduce the cost of production, thereby reducing retail prices and stimulating purchases, which would speed recovery.

Naturally, price wars were taking place in many industries as businesses with high fixed capacity wanted to get any incremental contributions possible, even though these revenues were at a loss.94

Despite interest rates declining, banks did not lend much to individuals because of their perceived credit and liquidity risks. Credit spreads blew out. The small individual seeking to borrow money was typically forced to pay over 40% a year! A common practice was that a wage earner's pay check was postdated. This gave rise to the often termed "salary-purchasers." These people offered \$50 for a \$55 paycheck, taking advantage of the person who needed the cash immediately. Pawnbrokers were reported to be lending money at the highest possible legal rate and then forcing the client to pay \$10 for \$1 worth of merchandise to get around the laws. The "usurers" would collect \$10 a month interest on a \$50 loan for years at times. Below is a report showing average lending rates from various types of lenders to small individuals. 95

# 2Q1931 The Global Dollar Shortage Caused a Global Debt Crisis and a Strong Dollar

Because lots of debts were denominated in dollars and the ability to earn dollars fell (because of reduced US imports), and because the ability to borrow dollars also fell as credit tightened, a global dollar shortage emerged. Of course, simultaneously there were lots of debts denominated in all currencies that couldn't be paid, though dollars were especially short.97

Time magazine reported that the president of the Chase National bank said, "The most serious of the adverse factors affecting business is the inability to obtain dollars in amounts sufficient both to make interest and amortization payments on their debts to us and to buy our exports in adequate volume. Cancellation or reduction of the inter-allied debts has been increasingly discussed throughout the world. This question has an importance far beyond the dollar magnitude of the debts involved…I am firmly convinced it would be good business for our Government to initiate a reduction in these debts at this time."

The battle for world trade continued to lead to more trade barriers. With the trade war going on, foreign nations were unable to earn enough dollars to make payments on their outstanding loans.98 The effects of the deleveraging were becoming severe in Canada which was a prominent trading partner. Canada imposed tariffs so stiff against U.S. Steel that U.S. owners were forced to sell off assets in Canada.99

Fears over the banking situation were as alive in Europe as they were within the United States.100 The Treaty of Versailles had isolated Germany and Austria, reducing their economic viability significantly. The practices of "printing" paper money which came about via deficit spending that was monetized created higher rates of inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) in Europe.101 Germany was saddled with reparation payments it could not make. So, Germany was forced to borrow dollars in order to meet its obligations, but without a trade surplus it remained a credit risk.

Austria was in no better shape.102 The combined debts of Germany, Austria, Hungary and other Eastern European nations on a short-term floating basis appeared to slightly exceed \$5 billion. This was a figure which was almost equal to the peak in money which had been lent on call within the stock market back in 1929. This figure did not include long-term bond issues, war debts or municipal issues which had been floated and held largely by private investors.103 In other words, these debts were huge.

The small international investor was attracted to German bonds by the favorable carry, but Germany had big reparations payments so it indirectly sent this money back to the governments of the people it was getting the money from. Germany couldn't service its existing debt, most importantly its reparations, so it borrowed the money to do it. Many of the buyers of German bonds were foreign private citizens who were attracted by the higher interest rates (6% to 7%); the proceeds were paid to the foreign nations who demanded reparation payments. It was essentially a Ponzi scheme that transferred the earnings of the small investor into the hands of the German government through the medium of bonds, which transfers them back to the government that Germany owed it to. Germany wasn't really servicing its debts, but as long as this continued, nobody questioned it. This "Ponzi scheme" approach to servicing debt has, throughout time, commonly existed and, more than any other factor, caused credit problems.

On May 10, 1931, Germany and Austria signed a free trade agreement that was viewed as antagonistic by the French. The Bank of France, accompanied by many other French banks, presented short-term Austrian bills for

redemption. This was the final straw which broke the back of the European economic system as repayments were impossible. Britain came to the aid of Austria, advancing 4.5 million pounds. The French responded by selling the pound through the liquidation of their sterling holdings, which caused a liquidity crisis, to get back at Britain.

The liquidity shortage caused bank runs in Austria. On May 13, 1931 riots broke out in front of Austria's Credit-Anstalt bank, which was Austria's largest bank.104 On May 15, runs were reported throughout Hungary as well. On May 17, 1931 the Credit-Anstalt published its balance sheet and showed sharply reduced capital because of operating losses in almost 250 Austrian companies which it controlled.105 This triggered a run on its foreign deposits which threatened to exhaust Austria's gold and foreign exchange reserves.106

Similar problems plagued Germany. In June Germany's central bank, the Reichsbank, saw its reserves of gold and foreign exchange drop by one-third to the lowest level in five years. In an attempt to attract liquidity at the end of July, the Reichsbank raised its discount rate to 15% and its rate on collateralized loans to 20%. Bank runs continued in Germany so the German government took over the Dresdner Bank, the second largest in the nation. It did this by buying preferred shares, which was the popular way of governments buying interests in banks to help stabilize them. Sound familiar? Germany's reserves continued to decline throughout 1931.107

Hoover described the situations as follows: "The nations of Europe have not found peace. Hates and fears dominate their relations. War injuries have permitted no abatement. The multitude of small democracies created by The Treaty of Versailles have developed excessive nationalism. They have created a maze of trade barriers between each other…" The battlefront was forming along the lines of 1) socialism and capitalism within countries and 2) countries against other countries.108

Running from Europe, investors' money poured into the U.S., so U.S. interest rates fell. The Fed reduced the discount rate to 1.5% in hopes of making the dollar less attractive to investors. Britain had been losing gold to the United States as scared investors fled Britain and Europe in general.109 The Central European states raised their interest rates in an attempt to attract foreign capital. This was then followed by foreign exchange controls so investors were not permitted to take money out of the country. This created a drastic side-effect – a halt in international trade.110 Although no one officially went off the gold standard in May of 1931, since the exportation of capital was prohibited, no gold payments were made. So this had the same result as abandoning the gold standard by the Central European states.

Global tensions worsened. In June of 1931, the European press began to attack the United States. They asserted that the economic policies of the U.S. were attracting the world's gold, creating the flight from European stock markets and foreign exchange markets. U.S. gold reserves had climbed by \$600 million despite the Fed's cut in the discount rate as the flight to safety was too powerful to negate. Despite the deleveraging in the U.S., the U.S. was viewed by world investors as still the safest place at that point, supported by the dollar shortage, debt squeeze in Europe, as well as political concerns there.111

As the second quarter of '31 began, hoarding of gold continued to rise including in the US which contributed to reducing the velocity rate of money by 22% from the previous year. Gold became very attractive both in physical form as well as in gold stocks.112

### On June 7, the German Finance Minister publicly stated that the Austrian banking crisis would spread to Germany in about 60 days in his opinion, so the panic began immediately. Virtually every German bank suffered runs and foreign banks began to pull credit seeking the immediate redemption of German trade bills and bankers' acceptances.113

On June 19th, in an attempt to ease Germany's debt problems, President Hoover proposed a one-year moratorium on Germany's war debts, catching most political observers by surprise. The international reaction to the moratorium was favorable. In fact, commentators expected the moratorium was the first step toward restoring international finances, stimulating trade and ending the Depression. Stocks and commodities rose for several days in what became known as the "moratorium rally".114

At the time (i.e., in mid-1931), there still was not a sense of crisis to produce stronger actions by the administration, as it was generally assumed the economy would recover and that the moves that occurred were adequate. Financial markets held up reasonably well through June. Governor Harrison of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York thought that the commercial banking system was stronger than ever because of its increased liquidity. No major industries appeared to be in danger of bankruptcy, and the U.S. economy appeared to be moving sideways.115

The stock market rose 13% in three weeks in the "moratorium rally" and was up 36% from June 1st at this point.116 This was the biggest rally since the decline began and commodity prices soared as well, so confidence again returned.

Within a week of Hoover's public announcement of his moratorium proposal, 15 governments had agreed with the plan "unconditionally!" The only important opponent was France who still held bitter resentment toward Germany. So, many people believed that the international debt problem was being managed.

The chart below puts this rally in perspective. It conveys how seeming very big rallies at the time, and the big increases in confidence that accompanied them, were rather small when one steps back to put them in perspective. There was, and still is, a strong tendency for people – workers, investors and policymakers – to exaggerate the importance of relatively small things because they look big up close.

The international debt crisis.md) continued during the moratorium rally. On July 11th, only five days after the moratorium was announced, the German government asked the United States to make further loans and to renegotiate reparations, because short-term investments were still being rapidly withdrawn from Germany. At the same time, the German stock exchanges were closed for Monday and Tuesday, and on Monday July 13th a nationwide bank holiday was declared in Germany. The German banking system was in chaos. Banks' deposits shrank almost 30% in the year through June 30, 1931 and the unemployment rate soared. The government was threatened from both the left and the right as Communist riots broke out in many cities and Hitler threatened not to make German reparations payments.117

National governments were unable to finance their cash requirements in Germany, South America, Sweden, Hungary, Romania, and the United Kingdom, and virtually every South American country, except Argentina, defaulted on its foreign debts. Their bond prices dropped to a range between \$5 and \$25. Eastern Europe did not default during the year, but the prices of East European external debt issues dropped below \$40 in anticipation of the problems ahead. Economic chaos caused political chaos as the battle for wealth between workers and capitalists intensified. Almost every country in South America had a problem with revolution, revolt or war,118 so investors, both from these countries and from elsewhere, moved their money elsewhere.

# 3Q1931 The Debt Moratorium and the Run on Sterling…

The euphoric "Moratorium Rally" did not last119 because the moratorium obviously didn't fix the debt problems. On July 20, 1931, a conference was called in London to discuss the European banking crisis. Hoover's proposal was to call a complete "standstill" among all banks everywhere, preventing anyone from calling upon German or Central European short-term obligations. This didn't bring comfort to investors who had their wealth stored in them. A group of New York bankers complained to the White House and warned that they would not comply with the standstill, which led Hoover to later say, "If [bankers] did not accept within twenty-four hours (his standstill proposal), I would expose their banking conduct to the American people." So the bankers reluctantly backed off.120

English banks had lots of loans to Germany so when Germany couldn't pay these banks were in trouble.121 So naturally, investors wanted to take their money and run, so there was a run on England's reserves. The U.K. banks then, like the U.K. banks now, were in trouble because they owned lots of debt that was in dollars and not being paid back and they were losing cash because depositors and creditors were justifiably scared about what would happen to their money. Then, as now, the Bank of England could only resort to printing money, because credit from elsewhere was not ample. Seeing these problems, on July 24, 1931, the French began sizable withdrawals of gold from London. When the French began to withdraw their gold deposits, other nations followed suit. The Bank of England attempted to stem the run by implementing the typical textbook action of raising interest rates. Of course this didn't work.

Then, on August 1, 1931, the Bank of England asked the U.S. government for a loan from private U.S. banks. Hoover encouraged this action to be taken immediately. But the selling pressure against the pound through the withdrawals of gold by governments and the selling of the pound by private investors forced the Bank of England to request an even bigger loan on August 26. Both loans were made, but even this was far from enough to stem the tide.122 The bank rate was raised from 3 ½% to 4 ½% on July 29.123 Another big loan from US and French bankers was made on August 28. Note that, through history, the U.K. has always been a preferred country in getting U.S. loans.

But these loans didn't stop investors' run out of sterling. In fact, they essentially helped to fund them by providing the loans. During July the Bank of England lost nearly one-third of its gold reserves. The Bank of France supported sterling throughout the week of September 7-12 but Dutch banks began to call their funds heavily from London to meet their domestic cash needs, as they were being squeezed also.

On September 19 sterling dropped sharply and banks refused to book any speculative short sales of sterling. The London Stock Exchange was in panic.124 Finally, on Sunday, September 20, 1931, the Bank of England abandoned the gold standard and effectively defaulted on its foreign obligations. U.K. bonds plunged.125

Sterling fell 31% over next 3 months. On Monday, the first day of trading after the suspension of gold payments, sterling dropped to a low of \$3.71 from the Friday's level of \$4.86. Then, sterling exchange rates fluctuated widely, from as high as \$4.20 to as low as \$3.50 during September. As with the earlier described stock market action, there were plenty of false rallies with bullish sounding developments which easily could have led people to overlook the big move. Sterling averaged \$3.89 in October, \$3.72 in November and \$3.37 in December.

The Scandinavian countries devalued by a percentage similar to that of the United Kingdom (31%) as did Portugal, New Zealand, Egypt, and India. Australia devalued by over 40%, Canada by only 17%.

Every foreign bond hit a new low for the period in 1931, and every issue but those for Switzerland and France declined 20% or more from its 1931 high price, as investors ran from government bonds fearing that they would either be paid back with devalued paper money or be defaulted on. Bonds of Germany, Austria, and the rest of Eastern Europe, with the exception of Czechoslovakia, sold off drastically. Austria's bonds dropped to \$35, Germany's to \$22, Poland's to \$32, Berlin's to \$14 and Yugoslavia's to \$29.126

However, England's credit was not seriously hurt by the event, though the bond initially sold off. That is because the devaluation made it easy for the U.K. to pay off U.K. bonds with the pounds the Bank of England could produce. So on these bonds there was no default risk or a shortage of demand, so the only risk was inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) risk, but that wasn't a problem because the devaluation did little more than negate deflation. United Kingdom 5 ½% bonds due in 1937 dropped to \$92 immediately after the devaluation, having been \$104 a week prior, but \$90 was the low price for 1931 and the bonds were back over \$100 by year end. England had been so hampered by an overvalued currency that the devaluation acted like a tonic. Stocks in the next few months rose up 30%, and by the end of October the Bank of England repaid \$100 million of its foreign debts as money flowed back into London banks. This is a classic example of how devaluations in deflationary environments create debt relief and negate deflation rather than rekindle inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md).127 Of course, 30% less in sterling is still 30% so investors anticipating devaluations want to get into something stable like gold.

## Problems Spread to the U.S.

The devaluation of sterling in 1931 sent shock waves through U.S. securities markets that pushed stock prices to new lows. Some other countries' stock markets simply stopped trading. For example, the Berlin Bourse closed from July 13 to September 3, opened with short selling banned, then closed again. In Amsterdam on September 21, after a sharp decline in prices, all transactions were cancelled and the Exchange closed.128 The New York Stock Exchange remained open, but as in dark November 1929, short selling was forbidden and investors worried, so risk premiums increased.

The Dow Jones Industrials dropped more sharply than ever before, except for its collapse into November 1929. The industrials fell below the 100 level and closed September on the low of the month.129 The Dow declined a further 38% between September 1st and October 5th. 130 As October began, the havoc continued, forcing the industrials down to 86, nearly half the price at the peak of the "moratorium rally" during June 1931. Undoubtedly a good deal of the fear was of confiscation risk as well as price risk.

The sharp decline in stock prices during September of 1931 was also accompanied by a sharp decline in production within many industries. Auto production during September fell 25.6% from August levels.131 Commodities prices declined all year. Investors just wanted safety and that pulled cash and credit out of the hands of consumers and workers.

Banks needed to sell bonds to raise cash, which contributed to rising yields. Yields on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds rose from 3 ¼% to 4% in the fourth quarter of 1931. Also, there were concerns about U.S. Treasury's ability to roll bonds coming due over the next two years as a result of its World War I Liberty Bond financing

maturing.132 There was a \$2 billion budget deficit to finance, plus \$10 billion in U.S. maturities in 1932-1933. The U.S. was beginning to look like the U.K. before its devaluation.133

After the sterling crisis there were no further refundings in 1931 because of the weakness of the market. The U.S. Treasury 4 ¼% bonds due in 1952 dropped from over \$114 in June to as low as \$102 in October, rose back to \$108 in November and fell down again to \$100 in December – all of which was too much volatility for successful underwriting.134

Despite the fact that the Supreme Court had upheld the legality of shortselling back in 1905, the growing sentiment was clearly seeking a scapegoat, and stock market bears and Wall Street tycoons became the targets. They were widely blamed for causing the numerous bank failures and governmental defaults.135 As law suits mounted and people fought over losses – sometimes in the courts and sometimes in the streets – the Dow Jones Industrials fell severely as capitalists got scared and sought safety.136

# 4Q1931

International Crisis Shakes Domestic Markets

The decline in business conditions accelerated sharply after the international crisis as those who controlled businesses were the capitalists and capital preservation was their primary objective. Bank failures were at record levels in the last quarter of 1931, and many industries, particularly railroads, began to suffer severe losses. The Gross National Product dropped 7.7% in constant dollars. Unemployment approached 25% by the end of the year.137 While National Income had declined by 31% in current dollars from the peak, the income of all businesses fell 65%. Corporate profits had declined from 10% of National Income to a loss equal to a negative 1 ½% of National Income.138

At the time, hardly anyone believed that more and cheaper credit availability would have stimulated business, because even with interest rates of zero, the real cost of more borrowing was very high and the industries which needed credit weren't good credits.139 It was unimaginable then, and comparably implausible to us now, that banks and other investors will lend to unsound borrowers in a deflation.

In September 1931, the dollar ceased to be a safe haven. Since other countries defaulted and devalued, their needs for dollars fell and the United States' budget and credit problems started to raise concerns140 that the U.S. would have to choose between default and devaluation. So, after the sterling crisis and the U.S. banking crisis worsened, gold reserves fell, the economy fell, and there was a run on banks.141 U.S. gold reserves increased right up to the week ending Saturday, September 19, 1931—the day before the United Kingdom decided to suspend gold payments. The U.S. gold outflow began on the following Monday, when foreign banks, including the Bank of France, bought almost \$100 million in gold from the Federal Reserve. Within three weeks of the suspension of sterling, the United States lost approximately 10% of its reserves.142 The Fed raised the discount rate substantially, hoping that higher interest rates would attract investors back.143

132 Wigmore p. 289 133 Wigmore p. 226 134 Wigmore p. 289 135 Armstrong p. 366 136 Armstrong p. 321 137 Wigmore p. 209 138 Wigmore p. 229-30 139 Wigmore p. 227 140 Armstrong p. 373 141 Wigmore p. 214 142 Wigmore p. 215 143 Armstrong p. 373

To counter the gold outflow, the New York Federal Reserve Bank raised its discount rate from 1 ½% to 2 1/2% on October 8th, but foreign investors' concerns had reached the point of not being affected by changes in interest rates. Rumors abroad that the United States would go off the gold standard as the U.K. did prompted a record one-day gold outflow on October 14th. The New York Federal Reserve Bank discount rate was raised another 1% to 3 ½% the next day. The next week, France agreed not to withdraw any more gold from the United States, and both countries agreed to consult each other before advancing any new proposals for extending the war debts moratorium.144

However, the supply-demand imbalance for dollars continued to worsen as the Federal government's deficit became too big to fund in September 1931, so the Federal Reserve bought U.S. long bonds.145

In mid-October Canada prohibited the exportation of gold , causing investors who tried to protect themselves by hiding in gold to be trapped.

Besides foreigners withholding gold,146 there was domestic hoarding of gold and currency by U.S. individuals.147 There was a sharp contraction in bank deposits generally during the last quarter of 1931 as foreigners pulled out and individuals shifted bank deposits into gold and cash hoarding.148 Reflecting this, currency in circulation, including gold and silver, jumped by about 20% from June 1931 to December.149

The Fed's tightening to keep capital produced a cash shortage that caused loans to be called. Bankers began to call in loans from many sectors, trying to increase their cash reserves. Many homes and farms were forced into foreclosure because their loans weren't renewed. Company bankruptcies were increased as creditors called in all the loans to debtors. The contraction in the money supply was not caused by the Federal Reserve intentionally, but because of the behavior seeking safety via the withdrawal of foreign capital, domestic hoarding, and the foreclosure on property which further depressed the values of tangible assets.150

The Federal Reserve was given authority to buy U.S. T-bonds in April 1932 so it bought them as deficits increased and foreign investors withdrew funds. Because of the balance of payments imbalance being financed through the Fed's liquidity creation, a currency crisis developed.151

The chart below shows Fed purchases and holdings of government securities from January 1931 to December 1932. As shown, the balance sheet was significantly expanded by this process.

the multiplier effect, the supply of money created the supply of credit and that credit growth funded economic growth. In the 1920s,152 \$1 in gold led to \$13 in debt as money was lent and relent to create an amount of debt that was many times the supply of money. Of course, debt is the promise to deliver money, so when this ratio became high, the system became precariously balanced. When credit starts to fall, usually because there is not enough money to meet debt obligations, credit falls and the demand for money increases, so the ratio falls.

When the supply of money is linked to the supply of gold, debt must contract more and economic activity must also fall more than if the supply of money can be increased. When investors lose confidence in a bank or the government and they hoard their assets (e.g., in cash and gold), as was the case during the Depression, the hoarding reduces the availability of credit. Since the Fed could not create gold, its only option was to create paper money. It was then believed that central banks could not create much paper money while on a gold standard because such a move would revive Gresham's law of bad money driving out the good.153 If investors wanted to cash in their US bonds, notes and bills at the same time, the government would be forced to choose between not increasing the money supply, which would lead to interest rates rising, or printing money. That is because not enough cash as measured through M1 exists to cover all the debt obligations. Of course, as long as investors feel comfortable with bonds as a "store of wealth," and don't need the cash, everything is fine. But when confidence in bonds is lost and/or cash is needed, investors run in the direction of cash and gold. There is simply not enough cash to go around, especially as gold is taken out of reserves, and a massive contraction takes place. When nations began to default on their bonds and the need of the federal governments to borrow more than investors would lend, confidence in bonds and government debt maintaining their value gave way, driving investors into gold and cash for safety. Because debt multiplies the value of these tangible assets, it creates a bubble which eventually comes to a head creating a stampede into cash. This has been true through history, all the way back to Roman times and before.154

![](Attachments/EconomicMachine_page_25_Figure_0.jpeg)

Through the 1920s and up until 1933, the money supply was essentially linked to the supply of gold and, through

During August, runs for cash closed most of the banks in Toledo and Omaha and banks in L.A., New York and Brooklyn. Bank failures accelerated in July and August.155 In the Depression, the bank failures were primarily due to the declines in corporate bond, stock, real estate, and commodities values, as well as declines in business generally, which destroyed asset values and income. The weakness of the economy became apparent only in the summer months, as real estate foreclosures accelerated, wage and salary cuts were initiated in major industries, and domestic and international trade fell off sharply. Then, as now, real estate was one of the weakest areas of the economy. Real estate values had collapsed earlier in some regions, particularly in Florida and South Carolina.

152 Armstrong p. 370 153 Armstrong p. 370 154 Armstrong p. 371 155 Wigmore p. 218

This problem spread to New York where there were foreclosures on commercial properties and rental buildings by savings banks and life insurance companies which produced a rash of foreclosure auctions beginning in June 1931.156 Then, as now, the collapse of real estate values generated increased uneasiness towards the banks. The bubble in real estate was reflected in real estate loans by national banks doubling from 5% of loans in 1928 to 10% in 1930.157

Because illiquid assets could not be sold to raise liquidity, President Hoover wanted to allow the Federal Reserve to accept illiquid collateral to lend against.158

On December 10, 1931, Chase securities announced write-downs of \$120 million to account for losses in securities still carried at pre-Crash values. Similar credit problems were pervasive. Banks' net profits were reduced from over \$556 million in 1929 to \$306 million in 1930 to virtually zero in 1931. Securities losses at banks were a record \$264 million in 1931 compared with \$109 million in 1930 and \$95 million in 1929. Loan losses were a record \$295 million compared with \$195 million in 1930 and \$140 million in 1929. Interest earned on loans, bills and commercial paper dropped from \$1.6 billion in 1929 to \$1.3 billion in 1930 and \$1.1 billion 1931. Then, as now, the banks were squeezed from every direction.159

All sorts of moves were made to hide the real values of assets of banks. Such attempts to hide losses in deleveragings are typical. For example, laws were changed to preserve the fiction of profits, a moratorium was declared on removing railroad bonds from the legal investment list in New York State, so that banks did not have to realize losses on the sale of bonds taken off the "legal list", and federal authorities allowed banks to carry at par all U.S. bonds and other bonds within the four highest credit ratings (Baa to Aaa). 160

## Hoover's "Super Plan"

Then, as now, the administration started to exert pressure on the banks to lend. Hoover's "Super Plan" to do this created what was known as the National Credit Corporation. Hoover realized that vast sums of assets were frozen and that, combined with international investors' capital withdrawals, this spelled potential international disaster, so his idea was to create another form of central bank in a sense. The National Credit Corporation would be a private organization funded by \$500 million in deposit contributions from the banks themselves. In turn, these funds would be used to bail out banks with cash flow problems by lending them cash against good collateral held on their books. He believed that this was essential to bring a halt to the bank failures and the foreclosures which further increased fears among the people and led to domestic hoarding of gold.

Hoover's plan began to gel prior to the British default of September 21, 1931. At a confidential meeting during early September, Hoover called to the White House the entire Advisor Council of the Federal Reserve Board members, which consisted of 24 bankers and Treasury officials, and proposed that the banks pool together \$500 million for the creation of this new project. In addition, he proposed that this new pool be given borrowing powers of \$1 billion, thus allowing them to buy a substantial amount of illiquid assets to take them off banks' balance sheets.

Then the British default took place. Suddenly the gold reserves of the U.S. fell. Eleven days later, Hoover called a special meeting of the leading men from the banks, insurance and loan agencies along with several top government officials. Hoover wanted to avoid publicity on this meeting, so the meeting took place on October 4, at the home of Andrew Mellon rather than at the White House.161 Hoover later wrote that many attending the meeting held at Mellon's house did not want to contribute funds to this central pool and urged that the

156 Wigmore p. 228 157 Wigmore p. 220 158 Wigmore p. 224 159 Wigmore p. 221 160 Wigmore p. 221 161 Armstrong p. 375

### government should put up the money. But Hoover was strongly against using taxpayer's money, so the meeting ended with the bankers agreeing to call a meeting of all major New York banks for the following day.

Hoover had also proposed that banks and insurance companies hold back on foreclosures and that a central system of discounting mortgages should be established. Again, the concept was a central bank which would accept mortgages in the same manner as the Fed accepts cash or liquid notes. Basically this is what the Fed is doing now. The savings and loan group agreed with Hoover's proposals which called for an immediate end to foreclosures upon responsible people. The insurance industry refused to go along with the proposed banking structure which would have 12 districts and accept mortgages as deposits.

Hoover then met with Congressional leaders at the White House on October 6. He found them unwilling to use tax payer money to fund any government structure to provide stability for the real estate situation.162 Hoover then created the Home Loan Banks which stood in the middle of the savings and loans. He also created the National Credit Corporation, which further helped confidence in banks.

News of these new plans restored confidence both domestically and internationally. But at first, the Europeans misunderstood these proposals and assumed they would be funded by government, which they felt meant inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and a decline in U.S. gold reserves. Therefore, initially, this news added some pressure to the dollar coming from Europe. Eventually, they understood the plan and fears that the United States would go into default on its commitment to deliver gold began to subside along with the gold withdrawals going into year end. The concept of this new form of centralized private banking to unlock frozen capital and to help prevent further banking failures was well received by the markets as well.163 The low in the U.S. gold reserves had been reached during the final week in October and it rose steadily throughout November. Stocks also rallied. Everyone became bullish and even the famous investor Roger Babson, who called the stock market's top in 1929, ran a small ad with its headline "Is Bear Market Over?"164

The Dow rose 35% from early October to early November. Most of the rebound was concentrated in the week of October 5th-10th, during which President Hoover announced his proposals for a National Credit Corporation and various other provisions to ease the banking crisis. But, like other failed rallies on bullish announcements, this rally failed when the proposals proved too small for the problem.165 Stocks declined sharply, taking the Dow down to a new low of 74 in late December. That brought the leading stock averages down to only one-third of their 1931 highs and one-sixth of their 1929 highs. The only important nations which remained on the gold standard were the US and France.

# 1H1932

In spite of the National Credit Corporation, bank failures were still hitting the papers almost daily. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which was the TARP program of the time, was proposed to Congress by President Hoover in December 1931 and signed into law on January 23, 1932,166 with authority to spend \$1.5 billion. Largely as a result of all this support for banks and others, the Dow rallied from that December 1931 low of 73 to nearly 86 in early January which was about a 19% gain, but finished January back down at the 76 level.167

The tensions between workers and capitalists intensified in 1932. In 1932 there were demonstrations in Washington and politicians turned their sights on the investment community as a whole. Some politicians accused the banks of intentionally trying to destroy the economy of the world in an effort to force the United States to cancel the outstanding war debts of Europe so that normal commercial debts could be settled with the

 162 Armstrong p. 376 163 Armstrong p. 376 164 Armstrong p. 378 165 Wigmore p. 237 166 Wigmore p. 311 167 Armstrong p. 395

### banks. Some politicians supported the total abolition of the stock market while others urged that the shorts could be exposed and jailed as if their actions rose to the level of treason.168 The proletariat and politicians turned on capitalists and investors.

The fiscal 1932 budget deficit grew because revenues were cut in half between fiscal 1929 and fiscal 1932, while federal budget expenditures grew by half. Believing that a budget deficit could lead the U.S. to default, the administration began to push for tax increases and expenditure cuts.169 Everyone wanted a balanced budget back then. Business support for a balanced budget was almost universal. The American Bankers Association and the Investment Bankers Association predictably passed resolution at their conventions early in the year favoring higher taxes and lower expenditures to balance the budget. Political support for a balanced budget was broadly bipartisan.170

In January 1932, the Comptroller of the Currency abandoned mark to market accounting for banks. Bank examiners were instructed to use par value as the "intrinsic value" of bonds rated Baa or better held by national banks.171 The Comptroller of the Currency also issued a demand to all national banks that they report on what bonds they were holding. Even good bonds had been devastated so banks either faced huger paper losses on what they held, or suffered actual cash losses if they sold.172

Optimism returned in mid-February when the RFC began to make loans to banks and railroads and when Congress passed an amendment to the Federal Reserve statute permitting the Federal Reserve banks to hold US government bonds, as well as gold, as cover for Federal Reserve obligations so the Federal Reserve System was freed to pursue an aggressive open market policy of purchasing government securities without being constrained by the loss of gold to foreigners expected to follow such an "inflationary" policy. So, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 19.5%.173 The stock market immediately rallied back to the January high and managed to close above the 80 level.

On February 11, Hoover managed to obtain cooperation from all parties to usher through the Glass-Steagall bill, which broadened the scope of debt that was eligible for rediscounting at the Federal Reserve. Broadening the scope of collateral that can be discounted at the central bank is a classic step in the D-process. This was perceived as bullish as it was felt that this would help many banks to unfreeze assets that were previously unacceptable as collateral at the Fed. The bill was signed by Hoover on February 27.174

At the time, the Senate Finance Committee conducted hearings into international banking and war debts. It sought a complete list of all foreign bond issues which were currently in default. That information was obtained from the Institute of International Finance. The Senate made that list public in January 1932. The list totaled \$815 million worth of foreign bonds denominated in dollars with defaults covering 57 issues, with all being obligations of South American governments. The majority of the junk bonds were held by small investors who had been lured into buying them by numerous advertising campaigns which touted bonds as the "safe" investment and offered high yields.175

Investor fears intensified, so in Europe and the U.S., the hoarding of U.S. \$20 gold coins increased, with the premium rising to 50% - i.e., the price rose to as much as \$30.

Japanese bonds and the yen had collapsed. Japan had abandoned the gold standard a few months before, so the yen fell from the par level of 49.84 cents to 35 cents. As a result, Japanese bonds denominated in dollars

168 Armstrong p. 388 169 Wigmore p. 308 170 Wigmore p. 309 171 Wigmore p. 312 172 Armstrong p. 392 173 Wigmore p. 331 174 Armstrong p. 395 175 Armstrong p. 391-2

collapsed from 100 to 61. The total U.S. investment in Japan was reported to be \$450 million, of which \$390 million was Japanese bonds. But Japan's gold reserves had dropped to only \$190 million which represented half of the outstanding debt to the United States alone, so it wasn't difficult to figure out that Japan would default on its obligations to pay its debts in gold.

Throughout history the French have always been among the first to hoard gold in a crisis and the French government was always the first to ask for gold during a monetary breakdown – e.g., in 1968 when DeGaulle asked for gold instead of dollars from the U.S., etc. The French people are the same, so they caused the French government problems by asking the French government for gold. To avoid demand from the French public, the French government stated that it would only make gold payments in \$8,000 lot minimums. As a result, gold coins were in very high demand. In the United States, many contracts began to be issued in terms which required payment in gold coin. While gold was rising in street value, other commodities continued to decline.

That reflected decreasing confidence in holding debt, including government debt, during a deleveraging when the demand for commodities is weak.176

In February, the business failures were the highest on record for any month.177

In March, the stock market sold off again as expectations that the Fed's move to reliquify were disappointed. The market decline began in March and extended for 11 weeks until the Dow had dropped from 88 on March 8th to 44 on May 31st, a decline of 50%. This stock market decline occurred while the Federal Reserve was following an unprecedented open market policy of expanding its holdings of U.S. government securities from \$740 million at the end of February 1932 to \$1.8 billion at the end of July.178

The British pound, which had fallen from the par value of April 1931 before the devaluation, began to fall again, dropping to \$3.65 from its March high of \$3.77. The downtrend would eventually continue into November of 1932 when the pound dropped to \$3.15. Only the French and the Swiss currencies remained steady.179

Trading volume on the NYSE during April had declined to 31.4 million shares. This was the first panic sell off where new lows were achieved on lower volume. The Dow Jones Industrials fell almost continuously straight down, closing May on the low for the month. Yet volume declined considerably. The lower volume reflected

![](Attachments/EconomicMachine_page_29_Figure_5.jpeg)

## lower investor participation as they had essentially given up on it. Big sell-offs on low volume late in a bear market are a good sign of exhaustion. On a percentage basis, the market decline was about equal to the panic of 1907 and that of the panic of 1920.180

Hoover tried to but couldn't get credit going. Hoover and Treasury Secretary Mills regularly blamed the banks for restricting loans and condemned both the public and the banks for hoarding.181 Hoover tried to get the banks to lend, but couldn't. For example, Hoover organized committees of prominent citizens in all Federal Reserve districts to try to encourage the larger regional banks to make loans.182 During May 1932, Hoover requested a doubling in the RFC authorization to \$3 billion, of which \$300 million was earmarked for aid to local governments.183 But nothing was adequate.

Back then, the Fed didn't handle failed banks, so they were turned over to the RFC. The government didn't have the administrative resources to handle all of these problems.184

Like TARP, the RFC lent to financial institutions. In fact, the relationship with the Bank of America then and the Bank of America now is basically the same. In 1932, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation prevented bank closings from being more numerous by lending \$1.3 billion by the end of August 1932 to 5,520 financial institutions, which included its first loan to the Bank of America for \$15 million, which it ultimately expanded to \$64.5 million, and the Federal Reserve continued to buy U.S. Treasury bonds. The Federal Reserve System's holdings of U.S. government securities expanded from \$870 million on March 31, 1932, to \$1784 million by June 30.185

Then, like now, the RFC (the TARP equivalent) and the Fed made loans directly to borrowers who couldn't roll debt, while letting others default. They felt compelled to do this because the banks were unwilling to lend even to borrowers facing bond maturities. The intense desire for liquidity created such competition for short-term government securities that Treasury bill yields were negative in much of October, November and December.186

The decline in short-term interest rates was also driven by aggressive Fed buying of T-bills. Between April and August 1932, the Federal Reserve instituted an unprecedented open-market purchase program in an effort to create bank liquidity. This helped. The 11 months following January had fewer suspensions than either 1930 or 1931. Federal Reserve borrowing was relatively low for banks in major cities during 1932, and these banks' investments were stable, which also gave the impression that the emergency in banking conditions had passed. The effect on money market rates was dramatic. 3-to-6-month Treasury securities yields dropped 180 basis points from 2.25% to 0.30% in eight weeks once the Federal Reserve began its purchases.187

Interestingly, the market reactions to government moves began to change. While previously government programs to increase lending and spending were viewed by the market optimistically, in mid-1932 they did not produce optimism.188 It was then apparent that Hoover had established many programs to stimulate lending, spending and job creation, but they did not have the desired effect, yet they cost a lot of money. In fact, some government attempts to help banks hurt them. For example, the RFC lending to some banks saved them from bankruptcy, but the banks gave all their good assets to the RFC as collateral. A J.P. Morgan & Co. partner described this dynamic as follows: "For a fatal year and a half the RFC continued to lend money to the banks on adequate collateral security and gradually bankrupted them in the effort to save them." The RFC made large loans to banks on the collateral of real estate loans and securities that many considered to be of questionable value, but the RFC still had to make these loans based on some estimate of the fair market value of the collateral and with some margin of surplus collateral. These collateral values were well below the banks' book values in the

 180 Armstrong p. 404 181 Wigmore p. 313 182 Wigmore p. 326 183 Wigmore p. 312 184 Wigmore p. 323 185 Wigmore p. 318 186 Wigmore p. 326 187 Wigmore p. 318 188 Armstrong p.419

securities. As a result, the borrowing banks found they had pledged all but their worst assets to the Federal Reserve and to the RFC at a discount from the par values and could only get back a portion of their deposits.

Many banks would have had their net worth effectively wiped out if all their assets, securities, and loans had to be written down to the low values of mid-1932. This is essentially what happened when the RFC calculated how much it could lend a bank. This failure to make the banks healthy became apparent, so banks' deposits dropped further than could be borrowed from the RFC after it had sold its highly liquid securities, so the bank had no more good assets on which to borrow elsewhere.189

Borrowing from the RFC also signified a bank was in need, which led to withdrawals. There was a vicious circle in progress for the banks which borrowed from the RFC. Directors, officers, other banks, and often major customers were aware of a borrowing bank's problems, and this information circulated in the business community and naturally caused large depositors to be cautious about the size of deposits they left with the bank, so they pulled them.190 So, if word got out that a bank was borrowing from the RFC its condition was immediately suspect and runs on its deposits began.191

Because the banks wanted to hoard cash to keep safe and because they didn't want to lend to borrowers who weren't creditworthy, the banks did not want to roll over many maturing debts. Railroads were in trouble of their large revenue and income losses, so they were unable to pay the \$300-\$400 million in bond maturities that came due in 1932.192 But the government wanted the banks to rollover these debts, so the government via the RFC and the ICC mandated that railroad bonds (heavily owned by the banking system) maturing in 1932 should not be paid off in cash lent by the RFC, but rather should be settled by a combination of cash and refunding bonds which lenders had no choice but to accept.193 Needless to say, this further undermined the confidence of investors in their abilities to get cash from their investments and in the legal system protecting their rights.

In March 1932 suspicion led the U.S. Senate to authorize an investigation into securities practices which ultimately led to the massive legal and structural changes in the securities industry embodied in the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.194 The government investigation of stock manipulation was like a witch hunt.195 Understandably there was a lot of congressional digging that turned up abuses. However, this went beyond reasonable.

Congress had problems making decisions as conflicting factions argued endlessly. For example, the fiscal 1933 budget was debated in Congress from March through June while Hoover gave little guidance on the budget cuts necessary, trying to place the onus for them on Congress in this election year. Foreign investor reaction to both the anti-investor mood and the indecision in government was negative and contributed to capital flight, which was clearly expressed in U.S. gold losses throughout the period.196

The Federal Government had a big budget deficit and the pending tax bill seemed to be going nowhere. Meanwhile, spending increased as Hoover sought to create jobs for the unemployed. The billions of dollars being spent in recovery attempts without any plan for paying for them scared European investors, so gold outflows

#### began to increase.197

Back then it was a popular technique of the government to package spending as loans – i.e., to create "loans" to entities which spent which allowed the government to keep the loans on its books as assets. For example, if the

 189 Armstrong p. 420 190 Wigmore p. 325 191 Wigmore p. 312 192 Wigmore p. 396 193 Wigmore p. 318 194 Wigmore p. 336 195 Armstrong 412-3 196 Wigmore p. 314 197 Armstrong p. 411

# government made a loan to a bank, it could treat that as an exchange of one asset for another rather than an

expense. This technique made the budget deficit look smaller than if the same money was provided as assistance. So, the government promoted loan programs outside the budget, particularly for the RFC. Of course, the impact of these loan programs on government financing requirements was no different than if the programs were government spending,198 so the supply demand imbalance for government credit remained.

At this time there was a move to redistribute wealth. Although governments would stop short of full blown communism, laws progressively were intended to redistribute wealth. For example, the gradated income tax rate eventually rose to 90%199 and the budget deficit ballooned (see below).200

In Europe, concerns about the deficit and the inhospitable environment in the United States sparked heavy withdrawals of gold by European investors. Within the first ten days in June, \$152 million in gold bullion had been withdrawn. On June 6, 1932, President Hoover signed into law the new Revenue Act, which increased income taxes and corporation taxes along with a variety of excise taxes. On June 14, 1932, France withdrew her last gold which was held on deposit at the NY Federal Reserve.201

The Federal Reserve publicly reassured the public that it intended to continue buying U.S. governments in order to fund the deficit and hold interest rates down. Of course, this was incompatible with the stable exchange rate policy. So, despite these assurances, purchases of bonds finally came to a halt in August, after which the Federal Reserve holdings of U.S. securities remained very stable at \$1,850 million. That year net new U.S. borrowing in 1932 exceeded \$3 billion, the federal budget deficit exceeded \$2.5 billion, and the deficit was over one-half of federal expenditures.

On June 16 in Switzerland, a group of seven nations met and finally agreed at Lausanne to reduce the German reparations payments from \$64 billion to less than \$1 billion.

The economy continued to plunge with deflation. Broad measures of the economy in 1932 had dropped to about 50% of their 1929 levels in current dollar terms, though if expressed in constant dollars the decline was approximately 28% from 1929. There were a record 31,822 bankruptcies, with liabilities of \$928 million. Though these were painful, they reduced debt service obligations, thus helping to fix the debt service imbalance. Industry as a whole had an after-tax loss of \$2.7 billion in 1932, compared with its peak profits of \$8.6 billion in 1929, forcing drastic cost-cutting, reducing their breakeven levels.202 Through this painful process, those businesses that survived became leaner and meaner.

At the same time, workers became militant, which scared investors. Unemployment averaged 36.3% for nonfarm workers during 1932. During July of 1932, 11,000 veterans marched on Washington, demanding immediate cash payment of the soldier's bonus instead of spreading it out over several years.

The atmosphere of unrest, if not revolution, unsettled investors, businessmen and politicians, especially as socialism and communism were becoming more popular.203

Economic conditions.md) were miserable. In New York, most of the major hotels were in default. Tax arrears in New York City reached 26%. Conditions were even worse than in the farm areas, where drought and low prices combined to bankrupt farmers. Problems in the banking system dominated short-term money markets in 1932.204 This crisis virtually halted bank lending in the second half of 1932, as banks wanted to conserve cash and could not lend prudently.205

The great New York City banks had become the liquidity reserve for the rest of the financial system. Corporations and institutions which feared that their deposits would be tied up in closed domestic banks transferred deposits to New York. Regional banks built up their liquid assets by increasing interbank deposits with New York, so when the outflow from New York banks occurred it essentially represented the end of capitalism as we know it. In July 1932, it seemed as though the capitalist system had shut down, government was paralyzed and anarchy was brewing.206

On an otherwise un-eventful Friday – July 8, 1932 – the stock market bottomed.207 Going into its final low, volume was very low. Most of the speculative positions had been wiped out by that time. Understandably, risk premiums were extremely high.208

The lowest point for commodities prices was during the liquidity crisis in May and June, which was also the low point for stock and bond prices and for the economy. Interestingly, as the liquidity crisis worsened, stock and bond markets strengthened in the second half of 1932.209 The corporate bond market recovered in the third quarter as quickly as it had declined in the second quarter, in line with improvement in the stock market and modest recovery in the economy.210 The Dow recovered in August and September to a peak of 80, which was almost double the low hit in July (see below).211

During 1932, arguments over the war debts and reparations created a problem for confidence. As the December 1932 payment date approached, England and France petitioned the United States for a further extension of the moratorium on payments. The moratorium was not extended, so in December, France, Belgium, Hungary and Poland defaulted on their war debts. England paid its installment, as due, in gold.

The situation in Germany was much worse. The policies of government had forced on Germany a severe deflation, which by the fall of 1932 had cut the standard of living by nearly 50%. As a result, political and social conflicts intensified. Polarity increased, and Communistic and Hitlerist groups gained popularity.212 There were regular weekend street riots between Nazis and Communists in which deaths were frequent. In July, the Reich took over the government of Prussia and declared a state of emergency in Berlin, in September the military pushed the Republic to request the right to rearm, and the country's finances appeared to be collapsing. German gold reserves continued to decline.213 These circumstances led to Hitler's victory in 1932.

Japan also became militaristic and invaded Manchuria in 1931 and Shanghai in 1932. Domestic and international conflicts increased around the world.214

There were opportunities in 1932 to make significant profits from the price movements in middle grade bonds. For example, Australia's bonds rose over 150% from their lowest 1931 price of \$35; Finland's bonds doubled in price from a low of \$34 in 1931 to a high of \$68 in 1932; bonds of Argentina rose 92 1/2% from their 1931 low price; Japan's rose by 72%; and Czechoslovakia's rose by approximately 50%. Investors could have tripled their money in the bonds of Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Uruguay, Yugoslavia, and Berlin between their low and high prices for 1931-32. Chile's bonds traded between \$15 and \$3 ½, Peru's between \$10 and \$3, Bolivia's between \$10 and \$3 ¼. 215

Western Europe's bonds recovered from the 1931 currency crisis, and the yields on the best bonds declined to nearly as low as Aaa corporate bond yields. However, East European and South American bonds hit new low prices in 1932 as these parts of the world suffered such social and economic dislocations that even the most daring speculators were unwilling to bet on these bonds.216

The gold drain also stopped, and foreign funds began to return to the United States. Foreign optimism improved considerably, especially in England, Germany, France and Australia. A League of Nations survey on the world economy found cautious optimism in most countries.

Why did the stock market bottom in early July? There was not much big news to bring it about. On July 2, Franklin D. Roosevelt was nominated at the Democratic National Convention, but this was no great surprise. The Wall Street Journal attributed the rally to a cessation of gold outflows, rumors of foreign buying, a general rise in commodity prices, and the approval of a railroad merger. Time magazine pointed to the rally in commodities, which was the single biggest jump in across the board commodities since 1925, but the commodities eventually fell to new lows in November though the stock market held the July lows and never violated the 50 area again.

Short covering was clearly a factor behind this bull move. Cornered bears, fat with three years of profits, fought madly to cover their short positions. Much of the buying flowed from Europe into the States, which also pushed the dollar higher. European buying of U.S. securities, which was reported from many sources in July, was largely driven by a hedge against a fear of further devaluations of European currencies.

In August 1932, the CCC decided to lend on the collateral of raw materials. The Commodity Credit Corporation was set up by New York City banks in August 1932 at the urging of the then Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Eugene Meyer, to lend on the collateral of raw materials.

There was also a strong corporate bond market rally, despite worsening economic conditions.md).

Roosevelt was elected amid widespread brokerage commentary that his success would halt the economic recovery and provoke a new crisis in securities markets. The Federal Reserve halted its open market purchases after August. Bank problems were obviously accelerating as well. New York City suddenly plunged into a major crisis. The news was bad. The old adage that when a market declines on bullish news, it must mean that it's a bear market and, conversely, when a market rallies on bearish news, it must be a bull market, proved true.

Roosevelt's campaign for the Presidency began in August with a strong anti-market tone, which added to the volatility of the market. Franklin Roosevelt opened his campaign with a nine-point speech focused solely on securities abuses and demanding federal control of stock and commodities exchanges. He criticized the Hoover Administration for the activities of 1929, for the activities of bank investment affiliates, for Federal Reserve policies, for foreign bond issues, and for stock market speculation.217 Roosevelt also indicated that he favored a devaluation of the dollar.

Europeans began to sell the dollar dramatically when Roosevelt won the election, because he represented soft money to them.

USD vs GBP Exchange Rate

The stock market did not recover during the rest of the year because fear of Roosevelt's success was widespread up to the November 8th election, and the reality of it did not engender investor confidence.

But to the average working man this election was reason for optimism. The Republicans were marked as the party for the rich and the Democrats emerged as the defender of the poor and working class. So while capitalists were scared, workers were hopeful.

On the eve before the elections, pressure from many sectors demanded that Roosevelt clarify his position about devaluation. He did. He pledged that he would not abandon the gold standard and conveyed that concerns he would devalue were not warranted. He was not the first nor the last government official to knowingly mislead the public regarding their willingness to support their currencies.

Though very painful, the deleveraging was not devastating for everyone. Throughout the deleveraging, major companies except for railroads and investment companies didn't default. Numerous industries did not have losses, and several even maintained their profit levels. Cigarette companies, can manufacturers, food, drug, grocery and variety store companies, and utilities all kept their net income at levels up to half their 1929 levels.

In contrast, bonds of East European and South American governments fell to approximately 10% of par value. Many railroad bonds, too, had great losses, but among the major issues which lost their top credit ratings the decline was to approximately 40% of par. Only a small proportion of municipal bonds went into default.

# 1933

Upon Roosevelt's winning the election, rumors began to spread that a devaluation was in the works. The Democratic party had long been a symbol of "soft money," going back to the 1890s when they were known as the "Silver Democrats" with William Jennings Bryan's famous speech of "Thou shalt not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold." And Roosevelt's campaign rhetoric encouraged these rumors.218

A devaluation would help workers by raising wages, but it would hurt debtholders as the value of their securities was tied to the value of money. So, investors fled, and in January, there were big gold withdrawals. Foreign banks began to redeem their dollars for gold, further increasing the drain upon reserves, and the withdrawal of gold coin from the Treasury was approaching a crisis level as private investors also sought to convert their bonds into gold.219

On the 18th of February, a Senator who had publicly accepted the post of Secretary of the Treasury under Roosevelt announced that he had refused the post because upon meeting with Mr. Roosevelt, the President-elect would not provide the Senator with an assurance that the gold standard would be maintained. The New York Times wrote "…at no time in the recent economic history of America has there been greater need than at present for a flat declaration of a monetary policy by the new American government. A declaration by Mr. Roosevelt declaring firm resolution to maintain a sound currency would have an extremely reassuring effect." He did not reply with these assurances, which raised concerns.220

Between November 1932 and March 1933, there was clearly an anticipation of possible reflationary policies of the President-elect which caused a flight from the dollar, which sparked numerous Europeans to dump their holdings, and which in turn forced the Dow Jones Industrials down from 62 to 50 moving into February 1933. Investor hoarding of gold and foreign investors leaving the U.S. hastened the banking liquidity crisis.

 <sup>218</sup> Armstrong p. 446 219 Armstrong p. 448 220 Armstrong p. 449

## In reaction to this flight from the dollar and from the U.S., Hoover wanted capital export controls.221 Foreign exchange controls are quite normal in situations like this and very scary for investors. To justify his ability to do this, Hoover attempted to use the War Powers, but the Democrats blocked this move,222 which is interesting as typically left of center governments are in favor of capital controls and right of center governments are against them. The panic out of the U.S. accelerated from a slow pace to a stampede. Specifically, the gold stock declined slowly at first, from \$4,279 million on January 18, 1933, to \$4,224 million on February 15, 1933. It dropped a further \$168 million by March 1st, another \$100 million by March 3rd, and reports circulated that over \$700

million would be presented for gold on March 4th, the day of Roosevelt's inauguration.223

From the November low of \$3.15 when Roosevelt was elected, the pound jumped to \$3.43 by February just before this inauguration for an 11.25% gain. The smart money in the United States was buying foreign exchange while the masses were hoarding gold in ever increasing quantities. In the end, those who had bought the foreign exchange profited, while those who hoarded gold in the U.S. found themselves trapped, i.e. if they did not surrender their gold hoardings at the old value of \$20 prior to Roosevelt's devaluation in January 1934224 they were subject to criminal prosecution. It wasn't easy being an investor or a capitalist in those days. Business activity hit a low point in March 1933. In 1933, the Gross National Product reached its lowest point in the Depression at \$55.6 billion, or 46% below 1929. In constant dollars this was 31 ½% below 1929.225

When the banks closed in many states during February and March, many businesses closed completely. The resulting low level of business activity in February and March 1933 was shocking.226

# March 1933 Roosevelt Assumes Office and Declares a Banking Moratorium and Other Policies in His First 100 Days

*Roosevelt's Inauguration speech can be found in Appendix 1.* 

When Roosevelt assumed office on March 4, he declared a banking moratorium enacting the War Powers Act (which he had helped prevent Hoover from using), and he let the dollar slide.227 The stock market and the banks remained closed.

The reflation worked! By then, rents and debt service obligations and equity levels had been substantially reduced, so it took less stimulation to raise cash flows above debt payments. From 1929 to 1933, the bankruptcies and other forms of restructuring had reduced the debt by about 21% and financial wealth by about 30%. The deleveraging had also substantially reduced businesses' operating costs and break even levels, so it took less revenue growth than before to make them profitable. Furthermore, it increased risk premiums of investment assets to very high levels. So, reflation via currency devaluation and increased liquidity raised commodity and export prices and lowered real yields (making cash unattractive). Additionally, the inability to buy gold or move money out of the country made stocks relatively attractive. In the September 25, 1933 edition of Time magazine, the moves of capitalists to protect their wealth in this environment were described as follows: "Methods of hedging against inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) within U.S. frontiers have become a favorite coffee and cognac topic.

Purchase of industrial stocks is, of course, the most popular hedge, but commodities and land have been creeping up fast since the NRA threatened profits with higher labor costs. Some shrewd businessmen with little capital at stake argue that the best thing is to go as deep into debt as the banks (or friends) will allow; eventually they will

### pay off with cheaper dollars." The market action was great. Also, there was significantly increased government spending that helped.

Stock, bond, and commodities prices rose dramatically throughout March following the Bank Holiday. Moody's daily index of staple commodities actually rose 6% from Friday, March 3rd, to Tuesday, March 7th. The stock market reopened on March 15th. It was initially near the 62 level, but fell back to 56 for the end of the month. 228

The U.S. Treasury offered two new bond issues on March 13th - \$400 million due August totaling \$1.8 billion. Interestingly, after the dollar devaluation, the gold outflow was reversed, and the United States gained over \$325 million in gold in the week ending March 15th. Bank borrowing at the Federal Reserve dropped \$180 million in the same week as banks got more cash. During the next two weeks, short-term rates dropped 1%-2% as cash returned, and Fed policy remained easy. Bankers' acceptance rates fell back to 2%, and call loan rates fell to 3%, as the Federal Reserve cut its buying rate for 90-day acceptances 3 times within five days. 229

The first batch of charts below shows various measures of economic activity and prices. They all convey the 'V' bottom that occurred at the moment when the Fed substantially increased liquidity (which necessitated the dollar's devaluation against gold and other currencies).

As mentioned before, largely as a result of the dollar becoming overvalued and the credit crisis in the U.S., capital started to shift out of the U.S. and the dollar, forcing the U.S. to choose between tightening and devaluing. The next couple of charts show the Fed's tightening and associated interest rate changes that occurred in 1928 - 29 and in 1931-33 (until the devaluation).

The next batch of charts focuses in on 1932 - 34 - i.e., to squint at this period, we zoomed in on it (showing monthly numbers). The first chart shows the dollar, gold, and the government short rate. Note in the first chart how the government short rate shot up going into the devaluation (because of the currency defense), as money was being withdrawn from banks and from the U.S., and then how a) the bank "holiday", b) gold exports being disallowed, and c) the devaluation occurred together. When the banks opened their doors, everyone could get their money because it was provided freely. In other words, liquidity was increased to help alleviate the debt crisis.md). Interest rates continued to fall while stocks, the economy, commodity prices, and inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) all rose from 1933 to 1937, which was the same as during other post-liquidity squeeze periods (e.g. post ERM break-up and post 1980).

Once in power, Roosevelt used the RFC's powers actively. The array of financial institutions which had been forced to rely on the RFC was staggering up until then, e.g., by December 31, 1932, loans had been authorized to 5,582 banks, 877 savings banks, 101 insurance companies, 85 mortgage loan companies, and 3 credit unions - a total of 6,648 institutions - for a total commitment by the RFC of over \$1.25 billion. An additional \$333 million had been committed to 62 railroads which were borrowing heavily from the banks. But this was small potatoes in relation to what was to come. 230

A Glass-Steagall II was passed, and it provided a federal government guarantee on all bank deposits up to \$2500, eliminated interest on demand deposits, set margin limits on loans to carry securities, set the limit that one bank could lend to one creditor at 10% of the bank's cap tal. and split commercial banking and investment banking functions into two industries. 231

Also, The National Industrial Recovery Act was passed. which was based on many of the ideas of Bernard Baruch, who had become one of Roosevelt's financial advisors. The act authorized \$3.3 billion in public works. Also, the Home Owners Loan Act provided a federal guarantee to refinance mortgages on homes costing less than \$20,000. The Agricultural Adjustment Act provided for the withdrawal of farm land under production in return for federal cash payments, 4 ½% refinancing of farm mortgages, and a promise of farm product price supports at a minimum of production cost. The Act also provided numerous measures to promote credit expansion, including presidential authority to devalue the gold content of the dollar by up to 60%.232 A special Sunday night session of Congress was called to consider the Emergency Banking Act. which authorized the RFC to borrow without limit and to buy preferred stock in closed banks without collateral to help them reopen. The act allowed bank notes to be issued up to 90% of collateral and the Federal Reserve to make loans against any collateral. When banks were reopened, government influence over the financial markets was established, and rescue missions were put in place by the RFC. <sup>233</sup> At the end of March, the RFC announced hurriedly prepared regulations governing RFC purchases of preferred stock in closed banks in order to help them reopen , and by the end of June 1933 made preferred stock purchases or loans.**<sup>234</sup>**

### President Roosevelt announced the end of the gold standard on April 22nd. All those who failed to turn their gold into the Federal Reserve were subject to a maximum fine of \$10,000 plus ten years in jail. 235 President Roosevelt issued an executive order, under power given him by Congress in the emergency banking act, ordering all holders of gold to turn it in to the government by May 1 or take the penalty. In May, when interest on U.S. gold bonds was due, which meant that interest to be paid in gold, not paper, Roosevelt broke the "covenant" as payment in paper dollars was mandated.236

In June the new Securities Act of 1933 came into being. It stated that if any "material" fact is misstated or if any "material" fact is omitted, each director is held personally liable for the loss incurred by a buyer of the security. The Securities Act also required registration of all new securities offerings with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), with the exception of local government issues, bank deposits, and commercial paper. The securities industry complained about the Securities Act, principally because it established criminal and civil liability for all participants in an issue for all facets of it for up to two years after the discovery of any untrue statement or omission in the prospectus, or up to ten years after the date of issue.237

Going off the gold standard caused stocks and commodities to soar. During early June, the meaning of the news about gold, the dollar, and foreign exchange controls finally hit home. The President was not going to cut the gold content of the dollar as expected, but he was going to eliminate the gold clause from public and private contracts.238 So with gold completely out of the picture as a store of wealth at any price in the U.S., the choice was to move money abroad or into something tangible in an environment of the falling value of money.239 Investors wanted something tangible so they bought stocks which shot prices to the best levels in two years. Similarly, commodities rallied to their highest level since the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) boom began. This type of market action is consistent with currency devaluation because, when the value of money declines, most things measured in it rise, and devaluations raise incomes because of price increases and improved export sales.

Stock multiples exploded as risk premiums fell. For example, stock prices for companies with meaningful earnings averaged 22.7 times 1933 earnings per share, compared with 10 times 1933 earnings in February, before Roosevelt's inauguration. Stocks at their highest prices went back to 85% of their 1929 low prices.240

Economic conditions.md) improved dramatically in just a few months, and securities and commodities prices quickly doubled. Business activity rose to 89.5 in July versus a low point of 58.5 in March 1933 and a peak of 116.7 in July 1929. This change was partly due to the end of the banking crisis, partly due to the devaluation of the dollar, which helped to raise prices, and partly due to the confidence Roosevelt inspired.241

In July, stock prices had a big correction. The Dow Jones Industrials had fallen 19.96 points in just three days! This raised concerns that the good times were over and the economy was going to plunge again. But this time the opposite was true. Prices traded in a range for several months before moving higher.

If gold was a good asset to hold but illegal, were gold stocks a good proxy and therefore a good investment? Initially, they were, but later they were not. The fixed gold price and inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) were bad for gold mining companies as their costs rose – e.g., "He would not let them sell their gold to anyone except the U.S. government and the Government would pay only \$20.67. Gold miners were out of luck – their costs mounted but the price of their product remained the same." However, because Roosevelt wanted to have this mined gold in foreign exchange, Roosevelt decided to allow the gold mines to deliver their product to the Federal Reserve and the Fed to sell the gold to foreign buyers at the world price. We are not sure exactly how this deal worked.242

The devaluation had converted unacceptable deflation into acceptable inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md).243 There was no statement of an inflation target (which nowadays we would expect), but the results were the same. Inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) went from -10% in 1932, to -5% in 1933 and +3% in 1934, mostly because the dollar fell by 39% against gold and 36% against the pound in 1933 (December to December).

Fearing more attacks on their wealth, U.S. citizens exported their dollars by the hundreds of millions to get them some place that they felt was safer. "'One of our problems,' droned Viscount Cecil of Chelwood, chairman of Britain's delegation, 'is the flood of unwanted money that is pouring into our banks. These funds, deposited in the main by U.S. investors, are subject to withdrawal at 24-hour notice and are of little or no value, though it has not yet been discovered how to get rid of them.'"244 Interestingly, Washington encouraged the flight of the dollar to weaken it. Unlike exports of gold, which were strictly banned for private citizens, the flight from the dollar was quietly encouraged by Washington.245

It turned out that Roosevelt could not declare gold to be illegal to own outright, since that would have been a violation of the Constitution, so he took another approach which the courts ruled permissible. It was ordered that all U.S. citizens file a report to declare how much gold they held. Failure to file the report carried a \$10,000 fine or ten years in jail.246

# 1934-1938 International Devaluations Follow the Dollar Devaluation

Between 1934 and 1936 there was a battle of official devaluations to gain price and trade advantages.248 Eventually, the French franc's overvaluation led to domestic pressures to devalue, which caused the French to act in September 1936. As part of that devaluation, the Tripartite Agreement was reached among the United States, Britain and France, which essentially stated that each nation would refrain from competitive exchange depreciation. By then, it became obvious that all countries could just as easily devalue their currencies in response to other devaluations, and a war of competitive devaluation caused turbulence only to get everyone right back where they began.249 At the end of the day, the result was that all currencies devalued a lot against gold and not much against each other.

It was the contraction from the 1937 high which gave rise to a new term which was "recession."250 It is worth a look at some of the key stats from 1933-1941.

In 1933-37, bond yields fell and credit spreads shrank. The spread between Moody's AAA corporate bond yield and that of U.S. Treasury issues began to narrow significantly. Corporate yields declined by 27.3% while Treasury yields declined only 17.2%. Stock prices rose, money supply grew and capitalism returned essentially to normal, though at a greatly reduced rate from the 1929 peak. Let's look at this increase in capital formation.

Money supply, as measured by M1, rose some 55% between 1933 and 1937, and total credit expanded by 8%. However, this increase in total debt was due to a 36% increase in government debt and virtually no change in private sector debt. Nominal GDP rose by 48% and the GDP deflator rose by 8% (1.5% per year). Of the \$36

billion increase in nominal GDP that occurred from the end of 1932 to the end of 1937, \$5 billion was from government spending, \$18 billion was from private domestic spending and \$ 5 billion was from exports.251 The wholesale price index rose 30.8%, or 5.5% per year.

In 1937, signs of the economy stalling emerged. The stock market had rallied back to the November 1929 low. Commodities, at their peak in 1937, barely managed to rally then declined to new lows. When the severe recession into 1938 began, government expenditures continued to rise in the United States. Total government purchases rose 8.7%, while total GDP declined 5%. Unemployment rose 32.8% between 1937 and 1938, to a rate of 17%. Interest rates began to decline from their 1937 high.252

By 1937, real GDP had finally reached its 1929 levels. It was not until 1954 that the Dow finally reached its 1929 levels. In 1939 the U.K. went to war with Germany, which begins another story.

# Appendix One Roosevelt's First Inaugural Address

President Hoover, Mr. Chief Justice, my friends: This is a day of national consecration, and I am certain that my fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the Presidency I will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our nation impels.

This is pre-eminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper.

So first of all let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear...is fear itself... nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.

In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days. In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things. Values have shrunken to fantastic levels: taxes have risen, our ability to pay has fallen, government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income, the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade, the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side, farmers find no markets for their produce, the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone.

More important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment.

Yet our distress comes from no failure of substance. We are stricken by no plague of locusts. Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply.

Primarily, this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failures and abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men.

True, they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit, they have proposed only the lending of more money.

Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored conditions. They know only the rules of a generation of self-seekers.

They have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish.

The money changers have fled their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths.

The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.

Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money, it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort.

The joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits.

These dark days will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves and to our fellow-men.

Recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be values only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit, and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing.

Small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, on unselfish performance. Without them it cannot live.

Restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. This nation asks for action, and action now.

Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously.

It can be accompanied in part by direct recruiting by the government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our national resources.

Hand in hand with this, we must frankly recognize the over-balance of population in our industrial centers and, by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land.

The task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products and with this the power to purchase the output of our cities.

It can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss, through foreclosure, of our small homes and our farms.

It can be helped by insistence that the Federal, State, and local governments act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced.

It can be helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered, uneconomical and unequal. It can be helped by national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities which have a definitely public character.

There are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped merely by talking about it. We must act, and act quickly.

Finally, in our progress toward a resumption of work we require two safeguards against a return of the evils of the old order: there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments; there must be an end to speculation with other people's money, and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.

These are the lines of attack. I shall presently urge upon a new Congress in special session detailed measures for their fulfillment, and I shall seek the immediate assistance of the several States.

Through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in order and making income balance outgo.

### Our international trade relations, though vastly important, are, to point in time and necessity, secondary to the establishment of a sound national economy.

I favor as a practical policy the putting of first things first. I shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment, but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment.

The basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not narrowly nationalistic.

It is the insistence, as a first consideration, upon the interdependence of the various elements in and parts of the United States...a recognition of the old and permanently important manifestation of the American spirit of the pioneer.

It is the way to recovery. It is the immediate way. It is the strongest assurance that the recovery will endure.

In the field of world policy I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor...the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others...the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors.

If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize, as we have never realized before, our interdependence on each other: that we cannot merely take, but we must give as well, that if we are to go forward we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because, without such discipline, no progress is made, no leadership becomes effective.

We are, I know, ready and willing to submit our lives and property to such discipline because it makes possibly a leadership which aims at a larger good.

This I propose to offer, pledging that the larger purposes will hind upon us all as a sacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in time of armed strife.

With this pledge taken, I assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our people, dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our common problems.

Action in this image and to this end is feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors.

Our Constitution is so simple and practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form.

That is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world has produced. It has met every stress of vast expansion of territory, of foreign wars, of bitter internal strife, of world relations.

It is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority may be wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us.

But it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure from that normal balance of public procedure.

I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require.

But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these courses, and in the event that the national emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me.

# I shall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis... broad executive power to wage a

war against the emergency as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.

For the trust reposed in me I will return the courage and the devotion that befit the time. I can do no less.

We face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of national unity, with the clear consciousness of seeking old and precious moral values, with the clean satisfaction that comes from the stern performance of duty by old and young alike.

We aim at the assurance of a rounded and permanent national life.

We do not distrust the future of essential democracy.

The people of the United States have not failed. In their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct, vigorous action.

They have asked for discipline and direction under leadership. They have made me the present instrument of their wishes. In the spirit of the gift I will take it.

In this dedication of a nation we humbly ask the blessing of God. May He protect each and every one of us! May He guide me in the days to come!

Appendix Two Legislative Changes 1930-1937

[^1930]: – 1932

- The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act,253 1930
	- o This act raised tariffs on over 20,000 goods.
- The Reconstruction Finance Act, 1932; created the Reconstruction Finance Corporation
	- o *Reconstruction Finance Corporation (*RFC), 1932 -53; Established under Hoover during the Great Depression to give financial aid to both private firms and public organizations; the corporation was authorized to lend to banks, building and loan associations, agricultural credit corporations, mortgage companies, insurance companies, states and their political subdivisions, and other public agencies. In 22 years the RFC loaned more than \$12,000,000,000 - total funding dispersed from 1932 through 1941 was \$9.465 billion. The RFC was empowered to organize subsidiary companies; the RFC Mortgage Company was established in 1935. The Disaster Loan Corporation was organized in 1937 to aid persons affected by floods and other catastrophes. During World War II, through the Defense Plant Corporation, a subsidiary, the RFC was also authorized to make loans to enterprises essential to the war effort. The loans were nearly all repaid. RFC was abolished as an independent agency by act of Congress (1953) and was transferred to the Dept. of the Treasury to wind up its affairs, effective June, 1954; in 1953 the agency's functions were transferred to the Small Business Administration and other agencies.
- Federal Reserve Act, 1913; (during the Depression the Act was amended a number of times)
	- o *Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act254* This authority was added to the Federal Reserve Act in 1932 (July) and was intended to give the Federal Reserve the flexibility to respond to emergency conditions.
	- o Glass-Steagall Act, 1932; temporarily permitted the Fed to use U.S. government securities to back its note issues (this authority was made permanent in 1933); the Federal Reserve Act (as amended in 1917) had required the Reserve Banks to maintain gold reserves equal to 40% of their note issues with the remaining 60% in form of either gold or "eligible paper" (e.g., commercial loans). The Act expanded the definition of "eligible paper" to include government securities.
		- *Section 10B* of the Federal Reserve Act (as amended in 1932) made formal the ability of the Fed to accept virtually any kind of collateral as part of its discount window lending.
	- o Thomas Amendment to Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 permitted the Fed to adjust commercial bank reserve requirements; gave the President the authority to require open market purchases by the Fed, and to fix the weights of gold and silver dollars.
	- o *Section 7 of the Securities Act of '34* gives the Fed the authority to set margin requirements on

securities.

- o Gold Reserve Act, 1934; authorized the transfer of monetary gold stock to the Treasury.
- o Silver Purchase Act, 1934; authorized limited Fed lending to industrial and commercial firms.
- o The Banking Act, 1935; expanded the Fed's authority to adjust reserve requirements; enhanced authority of the Board of Governors vis-à-vis the Federal Reserve Banks.
	- Reorganized the system of governance to create the FOMC and merged the offices of the chairman and governor to avoid conflicts.

<sup>253</sup> Legislation and Executive Orders are Underlined; Organizations/Initiatives are *Bold, Italic*

<sup>254</sup> Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to make secured loans to individuals, partnerships, or corporations in "unusual and exigent circumstances" and when the borrower is "unable to secure adequate credit accommodations from other banking institutions."

## 1 st 100 Days (March - May 1933)

- The Emergency Banking Act, 1933; This measure called for a four-day mandatory shutdown of U.S. banks for inspections before they could be reopened. It provided for the reopening of banks after federal inspectors had declared them to be financially sound and it ratified the suspension of the gold standard instituted through executive order. The law also gave the Secretary of the Treasury the authority through an amendment to the Trading with the Enemy Act to confiscate the gold of private citizens, excluding dentists' and jewelers' gold and "rare and unusual" coins. These citizens received an equivalent amount of paper currency.
- The Economy Act for Purchasing Goods or Services, 1933; cut federal costs through cuts of veterans' pensions and reductions in government department budgets. Also permitted the federal government to purchase goods or services from other federal government agencies or major organizational units within the same agency.
- Beer-Wine Revenue Act, 1933; legalized and taxed wine and beer.
- Emergency Conservation Work Act (ECWA), 1933
	- o *Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)*, 1933 1942; first created by Executive Order and later codified in ECWA was a public works project, operated under the control of the army, which was designed to promote environmental conservation while employing the young unemployed. Recruits planted trees, built wildlife shelters, stocked rivers and lakes with fish, and cleared beaches and campgrounds. Some 2.5 million young men were ultimately put to work on environmental projects.
- Federal Emergency Relief Act (FERA), 1933 -1935
	- o Established the *Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA)* to distribute \$500 million to states and localities for relief or for wages on public works; FERA would eventually pay out approx. \$3 billion; FERA was the first of the New Deal's major relief operations. It provided assistance for the unemployed, supporting nearly five million households each month by funding work projects for more millions of mostly unskilled workers. It also provided vaccinations and literacy classes for millions who could not afford them; it was replaced by *Works Progress Administration (WPA)* in 1935.
	- o *Federal Surplus Relief Corporation,* later changed to the *Federal Surplus Commodities Corporation*, 1933; one of the programs instituted under FERA; it helped farmers by buying up price-depressing surplus commodities from the open market; and it served as the agency through which these surplus commodities were made available to the state and local relief administrations for distribution to those in need of relief. It was continued as an agency under the Secretary of Agriculture and consolidated in 1940 with the Division of Marketing and Marketing Agreements into the Surplus Marketing Administration, and finally merged into the *Agricultural Marketing Administration* by Executive Order 9069 of February 23, 1942.
- Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), 1933; designed to help American farmers by stabilizing prices and limiting overproduction, the AAA initiated the first direct subsidies to farmers who did not plant crops; precursor to current Farm Bill. Through the AAA, farmers were paid to reduce their crops, either by plowing them under or by not cultivating a certain amount of acreage. The targeted commodities were wheat, cotton, corn, tobacco, rice, milk, and hogs (young livestock were slaughtered); the cost of the program was assumed by a tax on middlemen and food processors, such as grain elevator operators and meatpacking companies. By 1934, the production of several staple crops had decreased and farm prices, as well as farm income, rose accordingly; in 1935, the United States Supreme Court declared the tax paying for the program unconstitutional as an unnecessary invasion of private property rights. The AAA payments, however, were quickly reinstituted without the "processing tax" under the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, 1935.

- o The Second AAA (1938) provided for the storage of surplus crops in government warehouses and made loans to farmers in years of overproduction to compensate for lower market prices.
- Tennessee Valley Authority Act (TVA), 1933; created the *Tennessee Valley Authority*; considered one of the more ambitious reform programs. It was created for the purpose of developing the Tennessee River watershed, revitalizing the seven-state region – one particularly hard hit by the Great Depression – by building 16 dams to control flooding, generate hydraulic power, and increase agricultural production. TVA provided jobs, low-cost housing, reforestation, and many other conservation-related services to the region; TVA brought electricity, flood control, and recreational facilities to seven comparatively impoverished states. Today, the TVA is still the largest public provider of electricity in the United States.

# 2nd 100 Days (June 1933)

- Joint Resolution to abandon the gold standard, 1933; abandoned the gold standard.
- National Employment System Act (June 6); created the U.S. Employment Service.
- Home Owners Refinancing Act, 1933; established the *Home Owner's Loan Corporation (HOLC)* to assist in the refinancing of homes. Between 1933 and 1935, one million people received long term loans through the agency.
- The Banking Act (better known as 2nd Glass-Steagall Act), 1933; it set forth stringent regulations for banks; it required the separation of investment and commercial banking functions – only 10% of a commercial bank's income could come from securities; empowered the Fed to regulate interest rates on demand and savings deposits (Regulation Q); provided bank depositors with insurance of up to \$5,000 through the newly formed *Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).*
- The Farm Credit Act, 1933; provided refinancing of farm mortgages refinanced about 20% of all farm mortgages in 18 months.
- *Farm Credit Agency (FCA)* , a Government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) overseeing the Farm Credit System – a network of borrower-owned lending institutions - and tasked with providing American agriculture with a dependable source of credit. Originally established in 1916 in response to farmer requests for liberal credit facilities and low interest rates, the FCA initially provided a system for mortgage credit through 12 regional farm land banks with most of the original capital supplied by the government. In 1932, the government invested \$125 million in the bonds of the farm land banks to bolster them and thus again became the majority stockholder. All then existing federal agriculturalcredit organizations were unified into one agency, the FCA. Congress authorized that agency to extend the system of farm-mortgage credit. Funds were made available for loans on easy terms for first or second mortgages to debtors whose collateral was so low in value or so encumbered by debt as to make refinancing by the land banks unfeasible. In 1933, the FCA was also authorized to establish 12 production credit corporations and banks for cooperatives. The result was a centralized source of farm credit. A part of the Dept. of Agriculture after 1939, the FCA again became an independent agency in 1953 supervising the Farm Credit System for American agriculture.
- Emergency Railroad Transportation Act, 1933; increased federal regulation of railroads.
- National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), 1933;
	- o Established the *National Recovery Administration (NRA)* to stimulate production through curtailed competition and having American industries set up a series of codes designed to regulate prices, industrial output, and general trade practices. The federal government, in turn,

# would agree to enforce these codes. In return for their cooperation, federal officials promised to suspend anti-trust legislation. Portions of the NIRA were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1935 because it violated the separation of powers clause; however, the *Works Progress Administration (WPA)*, which was the second part of the NIRA, was allowed to stand. The majority of NIRA's collective bargaining stipulations survived in two subsequent bills: Section

- 7A of the NIRA recognized the rights of labor to organize and to have collective bargaining, and the labor provisions of the fair-competition codes established the 40-hour week, set a minimum weekly wage, and prohibited child labor under the age of 16; NIRA also earmarked \$3.3 billion for public works through the *Public Works Administration (PWA).*
- o *Public Works Administration (PWA)*, 1933 1941; the PWA created public works as economic stimulus and continued until the U.S. ramped up wartime production for World War II; received a \$3.3 billion appropriation; built large public works projects; used private contractors (did not directly hire unemployed); PWA's efforts mostly focused on permanent projects, including the first federal housing program, support for public power through reclamation projects in the West, and a range of public improvements from bridges to lighthouses.
