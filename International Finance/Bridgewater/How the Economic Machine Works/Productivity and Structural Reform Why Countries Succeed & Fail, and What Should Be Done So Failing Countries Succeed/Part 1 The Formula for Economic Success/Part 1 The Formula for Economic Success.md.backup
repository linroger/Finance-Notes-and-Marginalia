# Part 1: The Formula for Economic Success

What determines which countries prosper and which countries don't? What determines different countries' future growth rates? For our [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) purposes we look at relationships between causes and effects that we hope will be useful to others in answering these questions.

While many people have provided opinions about why countries succeed and fail economically, they have not shown linkages between causes and effects. As a result, their opinions can be misleading. Often, even commonly agreed-upon indicators of what is good for an economy have not been properly analyzed and correlated with subsequent results. For example, everyone knows that having a more educated population is better than having a less educated population, so naturally we hear that improving education is important to improving productivity. However, indicators of the cost-effectiveness of education are lacking and correlations of the factors with subsequent growth don't exist, at least to my knowledge. That is dangerous. For example, if [policy makers](../../../Chapters/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) simply educate people without considering the costs and paybacks of that education, they will waste resources and make their economies less productive even though we will become more educated people. To make matters worse, the views of those who influence polices typically reflect their ideological inclinations (e.g., being politically left or right) which divides people. For this reason, I believe that objective good indicators that are correlated with subsequent results are needed so that the facts speak for themselves and help people reach agreement about what should be done. That is what I believe I provide here. The economic health indicators that I will show would have predicted the subsequent 10-year real growth of the 20 countries shown over the last 65 years within 2% of the realized growth about 80% of the time and within 1% half of the time, with the average miss around 1%.

While I believe that the body of evidence I will show you is compelling, I certainly don't claim to have all the answers or expect people to blindly follow what is presented here without poking at it. On the contrary. I am putting these cause-effect relationships on the table to help foster the debate to bring about progress. I hope that people of divergent views will explore and debate how the [economic machine](../../../Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Principles%20Part%20II.md) works by looking at both the logic and the evidence presented here, then see what it portends for the future, and then explore what can be done to make the future better. Having said that, we are confident enough in these estimates to bet on their accuracy, which we do in our investments.

#### The Determinants of Economic Health Are Timeless and Universal

As with human bodies, I believe that the economies of different countries have worked in essentially the same ways for as far back as you can see so that the most important cause-effect relationships are timeless and universal. In this section I review these cause-effect relationships and look at many countries in different timeframes to show how they worked. I will lay these out for you to consider. I don't believe that it's good enough to just show the correlations between changes in these factors and their outcomes. I believe that it's necessary to be so clear on the fundamental cause-effect relationships that it seems obvious that they must be so; otherwise you can't be confident that a relationship is timeless and that you aren't missing something. I will first present the concepts and then take you into the indicators to show how they worked in the past and what they portend for the future.

### What are the Keys to Success?

**I Will Start With a Top-Down Perspective:** As with health, many factors (reflected in many statistics) produce good and bad outcomes. You can approach them by looking down on the forest or building up from the trees. In presenting them I wrestled with whether to start at the top and work our way down through all the pieces or start with all the pieces and work ourselves up to the big picture. I chose to approach this from the top down as that's the perspective that I'm more comfortable with. I prefer to simplify and then flesh out the picture. Receiving

#### information presented this way will require you to be patient with the sweeping generalizations I make until I get down to the particulars that make them up, which will show both the norms and the exceptions.

**Productivity Influences on Growth Are Intertwined With Debt Influences:** While my objective is to look at productivity in this section, in doing so I wanted to tie that into looking at the drivers of growth over the next 10 years, which is affected by debt as well as the drivers of productivity. In other words, productivity influences on growth and debt influences on growth are unavoidably entangled. As explained in "How the [Economic Machine](../../../Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Principles%20Part%20II.md) Works," while productivity growth is ultimately what matters for long-term prosperity, and the effects of debt cycles cancel out over time, the swings around that productivity long-term trend arising from debt cycles cancel out over such long amounts of time (upwards of 100 years because of long-term debt cycles) that it is impossible to look at growth periods without debt cycles playing a role in driving the outcomes. Of course, when one lengthens the observed timeframe, the shorter-term volatility that is due to debt swings diminishes in importance. We chose to look at rolling 10-year periods of 20 countries which gave us a sample size of 159 observations (where we measure every 5 years).

**The Big Picture:** Stepping away from the wiggles of any given day, and looking from the top down, one can see that the big shifts in economic growth are about two-thirds driven by productivity and one-third driven by indebtedness. "Luck" (e.g., having a lot of resources when the resources are valuable) and "conflict" (especially wars) are also drivers.

## Productivity

A country's production (GDP) will equal its number of workers times the output per worker (productivity). One can increase one's productivity either by working harder or by working smarter. Productivity is driven by how cost-effectively one can produce, so relative productivity—i.e., competitiveness—will have a big effect on relative growth. In a [global economy](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Fewer%20Or%20Even%20None.md) those producers who are more competitive will both 1) sell more in their own country and other countries, and 2) move their production to countries where they can produce more costeffectively. Likewise, investors will follow these opportunities.

Competitiveness (i.e., relative productivity levels) is driven by what you get relative to what you pay in one country versus another. Countries are just the aggregates of the people and the companies that make them up. As you know with the individuals you hire and from the products you buy, those that offer the most value for money are the most competitive and do better than those that don't.

**Specific Indicators:** Since people are the largest cost of production, it follows that those countries that offer the best "value" (i.e., the most productive workers per dollar of cost) will, all else being equal, experience the most demand for their people. That is why the per-hour-worked cost differences of educated people (i.e., their income after adjusting for hours worked each year) is one of the best indicators of productivity. Other obvious and important factors that influence productivity include cost of uneducated people, levels of bureaucracy, attitudes about work, raw material costs, lending and capital market efficiencies—i.e., everything that affects the value of what is produced relative to the cost of making it. In other words, there is a world market for productive resources that increases the demand, and hence the growth rates, for the countries that are most competitive because of "the cost of production [arbitrage](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md)." That cost of production [arbitrage](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) has been a big driver of growth—in fact overwhelmingly the largest. To reiterate, the magnitude of this competitiveness [arbitrage](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) is driven more by the cost of the workers relative to how hard they work, their education, and [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) levels, than by anything else. These variables characterize the value of hiring a worker in a given country and doing business there (i.e., what you pay for what you get).

Of course, barriers to the flow of trade and capital (like China's closed door policies until the early 1980s, geographic isolation, etc.) can stand in the way of people, companies and countries being allowed to compete. As these barriers break down (e.g., transportation becomes cheaper and quicker, telecommunications reduce

impediments to intellectual competition, etc.) or increase (e.g., trade barriers are put up), the ability to [arbitrage](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) the costs of production, and in turn the relative growth rates, is affected.

**While countries that operate efficiently will grow at faster paces than countries that operate inefficiently, the countries that will grow the fastest are those that have big inefficiencies that are disposed of.** As an example, in the 1970s and 1980s, China had a well-educated, intelligent labor force that could work for cheap, but faced a closed door policy. Opening the door unleashed China's great potential. Looking forward, while the United States is relatively efficient, it would not grow as fast as a Russia (i.e., which has competitively priced educated people with low debt) if Russia could significantly reduce its barriers to productivity (e.g., corruption, lack of development of its debt/capital markets, lack of [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), lack of innovation, bad work attitudes, lack of adequate private property laws, etc.). That is why I am most optimistic about inefficient countries that are undertaking the sort of reforms that are described in this section.

**Culture is one of the biggest drivers of productivity**. It's intuitive that what a country's people value and how they operate together matters for a country's competitive position. Culture influences the decisions people make about factors such as savings rates or how many hours they work each week. Culture can also help explain why a country can appear to have the right ingredients for growth but consistently underperform, or vice versa. For example, in Russia, which has a lot of untapped potential, the culture that affects lifestyles (e.g., alcoholism, the low drive to succeed, etc.) causes it to substantially under-live its potential, while in Singapore, where high income levels make their labor relatively uncompetitive, their lifestyles and values (e.g., around working, saving and investing) allow them to realize a higher percentage of their potential. While lots of elements of culture can matter, the ones that I find matter most are: 1) the extent to which individuals enjoy the rewards and suffer the penalties of their productivity (i.e., the degrees of their self-sufficiency), 2) how much the people value savoring life versus achieving, 3) the extent to which innovation and commercialism are valued, 4) the degree of bureaucracy, 5) the extent of corruption and 6) the extent to which there is rule of law. Basically, countries that have people who earn their keep, strive to achieve and innovate, and facilitate an [efficient market](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%2012%20Market%20Efficiency.md)-based economy will grow faster than countries that prioritize savoring life, undermine market forces through highly redistributive systems, and have inefficient institutions. To be clear, I am not making any value judgments. It would be illogical for me to say that people who savor non-work activities are making a mistake relative to people who love working. It is however not illogical for me to say that people who savor non-work activities are likely to be less productive than those who love working.

#### Indebtedness

At the risk of repeating myself too many times, I will review the way I look at debt cycles because I carry that perspective into my calculations in explaining 10-year growth rates.

As explained, short-term volatility is more due to debt cycles than productivity, but this volatility cancels out over time because credit allows people to consume more than they produce when they acquire it, and it forces people to consume less than they produce when they pay it back. Undulations around long-term productivity are driven by debt cycles. Remember, in an economy without credit, the only way to increase your spending is to produce more, but in an economy with credit, you can also increase your spending by borrowing. That creates cycles. When debt levels are low relative to income levels and are rising, the upward cycle is self-reinforcing on the upside because rising spending generates rising incomes and rising net worths, which raise borrowers' capacity to borrow, which allows more buying and spending, etc. However, since debts can't rise faster than money and income forever, there are limits to debt growth.

Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle—there is a limited amount of it that you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. In the case of debt, you can take it out before you put it in (i.e., if you don't have any debt, you can take it out), but you are expected to return what you took out. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is sustainable, which will give you the appearance of being prosperous. At such times, you and those who are lending to you might mistake you as

being creditworthy and not pay enough attention to what paying back will look like. When debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process works in reverse.

You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term [debt cycle](../../../Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%201928-1937.md) and the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of taking on new debt. For these reasons **I expect countries that have a) low amounts of debt relative to incomes, b) debt growth rates that are low in relation to income growth rates and c) easier monetary policies to grow faster over the next ten years than countries with d) high amounts of debt relative to incomes, e) debt growth rates that are high in relation to income growth rates and f) tighter monetary policies.** That is true with one exception, which is when adequate [financial intermediaries](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20as%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) don't exist. Institutions and capital markets that facilitate these transactions have to be in place for the system to work. For that reason, when [forecasting](../../../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md) long-term future growth rates we have taken into consideration the levels of development of countries' [financial intermediaries](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20as%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md).

**Luck and Wars:** As mentioned, they can play a role. For example, the US having shale gas was lucky. Potential conflicts should always be watched. While to some extent these can be anticipated, they are not part of our formula and they don't typically matter much—i.e., they are exceptional.

## The Interaction of These Forces is Driven By Human Nature

While productivity and indebtedness can be thought of as separate concepts, they are ultimately a function of the choices people make and their psychology. I briefly touched on culture as an influence on these choices and their outcomes. Also, I observe important shifts in attitudes from one generation to the next which are due to their different experiences. In Part 3, "The Rises and Declines of Economies Over the Last 500 Years," I show how psychology tends to shift as countries move through their economic life cycles. It is worth touching on this influence here before I delve into an examination of what all the economic health indicators are pointing to for the 20 major economies.

In addition to productivity and the debt cycles I spoke about, there tends to be a psychologically motivated cycle that occurs as a function of one's past level of prosperity and whether one experienced improving or worsening [economic conditions](../../../Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%20(2007–2011).md). When a country is poor and focused on survival, its people who have subsistence lifestyles don't waste money because they value it a lot and they don't have any debt to speak of because savings are short and nobody wants to lend to them. Even though the country's labor is low-cost, it is not competitive, and the lack of [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) stymies future productivity gains. Some emerge from this stage and others don't, with culture and location being two of the biggest determinants. For those that do—either because a country removes a big barrier like being closed to the world (as China did in 1980) or simply because a more gradual evolution makes their labor attractive—a virtuous cycle can kick in. At this stage, the investments are not just inexpensive; the stock of infrastructure and other physical capital is also typically low and there is lots of room to adopt existing technologies that can radically improve the country's potential. Leveraging up (increasing one's indebtedness) can feed back into higher productivity and competitiveness gains, which produce high [returns](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) that attract more [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) at a time when the capacity to [leverage](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) is high. The key is that this money and credit must be used to produce investments that yield enough [returns](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) to pay for the [debt service](../../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) and finance further growth (so that incomes rise as fast as or faster than debts). Yet as countries grow wealthier, more and more of the credit tends to fuel consumption rather than [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). A process that was once virtuous can become self-destructive. The decreased [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in quality projects means productivity growth slows, even as the [borrowing and spending](../../../Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Understanding%20Debt%20Crises%20and%20Their%20Management.md) makes incomes grow and labor more expensive. People feel rich and begin taking more leisure—after all, asset prices are high—even though their balance sheets are starting to deteriorate. At this point, debt burdens start to compound and incomes grow faster than productivity growth. In other words, the country tends to become over-indebted and uncompetitive. The country is becoming poor even though it is still behaving as though it is rich. Eventually the excess tends to lead to bubbles bursting, a period of slow decline and deleveraging. Suffice it to say that when looking at a country's potential to grow, it is critical to look at the country's productivity and indebtedness holistically, as part of its stage of development.

#### A Formula for Future Growth

As explained, my research team and I built the formula for future growth from the top down. We started with my concepts of how productivity and indebtedness affect growth, then fleshed these forces out with specific indicators, and then saw how the formula created this way worked. I followed this approach because I believe that one should be able to describe the cause-effect relationships and the logic behind them without looking at the data and that only after doing that should one look at the data to see how well the descriptions square with what happened because otherwise one would be inclined to be blinded by data and not force oneself to objectively test one's understanding of the cause-effect relationships.

As mentioned, from what I can tell, about two-thirds of a country's 10-year growth rates will be due to productivity and about one-third will be due to indebtedness. The visual below conveys these two forces. Our productivity indicators aim to measure how steep the productivity growth line will be over time, and our indebtedness measures aim to measure how debt cycles will influence growth over the medium term.

![](Attachments/EconomicMachine_page_4_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](Attachments/EconomicMachine_page_4_Picture_5.jpeg)

Below is a list of what I have come to learn about these things along with the names of the indices my research team and I created to reflect them. Based on the reasons outlined there, we created 1) a simple logic-weighted index of productivity and 2) a simple logic-weighted index of indebtedness. We used the same set of factors weighed the same way for each gauge across all the countries and across all timeframes. That way there was no fitting the data and our measures for productivity and indebtedness are timeless and universal. We put twothirds of the weight on productivity and a third on indebtedness.380 After creating these indices, we observed how each predicted the subsequent 10 years' growth rates for each country (which we measure every 5 years). In other words, we observed rather than fit the data. The table below shows the concepts, their weights, and their correlations with the next 10 years' per capita growth rates for our universe of 20 countries. Together these indicators were 84% correlated with the countries' subsequent growth rates. Below we show how well these measures related to future growth across countries and time.381

<sup>380</sup> As mentioned, our gauges of productivity and indebtedness are constructed using simple logic-based weights. Within productivity, we put two-thirds weight on what you pay versus what you get and one-third on culture. Within each of these gauges we put equal weight on the different sub-pieces. Within our indebtedness gauge, we put half the weight on [debt cycle](../../../Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%201928-1937.md) dynamics and half on [monetary policy](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md). 381 My approach to research is to first think through what makes sense to me and to look at the data to stress test my thinking. This is a very

different approach compared to optimization methods (or data mining) which typically go to the data first, and fish for relationships and conclusions. Because I was asked how much better the results would be if we let the computer fit the equations, we ran the data fitting exercise and observed that if we do that, the correlations with future growth don't change much (they range from 80% to 85% correlated with future growth results depending on the process used).

These measures of productivity and indebtedness can be used to predict each country's absolute and relative growth rates over the next ten years, or longer periods. They also can be used by [policy makers](../../../Chapters/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) to indicate what levers they can move to influence future growth. To reiterate, my goal is to get the big picture right—i.e., to reliably be approximately right by focusing on the most important drivers rather than to try to be precise by focusing on the details.

Before looking at the picture we will show you how our aggregate indicator would have predicted growth versus what actually occurred. While staring at the observations helps us ground ourselves in reality and test our logic, we know there is no precision in the specific numbers and what matters most to us is whether our logic is strong. Our examination covers 159 separate observations across 20 different countries over the last 65 years, which provides a wide range of different environments to test our indicator. Along with the correlation of our predictions and what growth actually materialized (shown below), another test is how reliably we predicted something reasonably close to what happened. In our set, our aggregate predictions for a country's average growth over the next decade were within 1% of the actual about half of the time, and within 2% around 80% of the time.

#### **Aggregate Estimate of Future Growth (x-axis) Against Subsequent 10yr Growth**

![](Attachments/EconomicMachine_page_7_Figure_0.jpeg)

Note: For periods where we have productivity and indebtedness. 159 data points over 20 countries.

Below we show the same perspective for each of our productivity and indebtedness gauges, comparing what they implied individually for a country's growth versus what happened. As you can see our measure of productivity is more strongly correlated with each country's growth than our indebtedness measure is (64% vs. 44%), which makes sense given it is the more important driver over the timeframes tested. Still, each has a fairly good relationship on its own.

![](Attachments/EconomicMachine_page_7_Figure_4.jpeg)

Because these are timeless and universal drivers, we expect them to be just as important in developed countries as they are in emerging ones. The type of [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) or education that matters may shift, but ultimately whether a country sees productivity growth is still going to be largely a function of the basic building blocks of productivity-whether its workers offer value, whether it is investing in its culture and creating a culture of success as well as how its indebtedness is evolving. Across the countries we have examined, our aggregate indicator is about as correlated with future growth for developed and emerging countries (69% correlated with the growth in income per worker in developed countries and 81% correlated in emerging countries). Of course, which countries are "developed" or "emerging" changes over very long periods as discussed in "The Rises and Declines of Economies Over the Last 500 Years." So in the tests shown below, we adjust for that, for example excluding Japan in the 1960s when it was much more like an emerging country.

![](Attachments/EconomicMachine_page_8_Figure_1.jpeg)

To reiterate, I believe getting to this fundamental level is critical to understanding and predicting the growth of countries. Na'ive measures of a country's future growth, for example just income on its own or a country's trailing growth, won't get you much because they won't help you get at the drivers. They also tend to be much worse predictors than the formula I have described here (about 25% as good by traditional statistical measures). Looking at the economy as a machine and granularly measuring the cause-effect relationships makes all the difference.

#### Projections

I will start with our projections and then explain how they were derived.

As discussed, by looking at the elements that drive productivity and indebtedness you can arrive at a view of how fast a country will grow its output per worker. Since economic growth is mechanically just a function of growth in its a) output per worker and b) number of workers, it's then a simple step for us to estimate economic growth. In the following section we quickly scan what our projections show. We will then go into depth on the reasons behind them.

The chart below shows our estimate in aggregate for real GDP growth in these major countries. We provide two estimates: one that is based on the exact same formula for all countries and one that is that estimate corrected for the average past error. This additional step notes whether we were systematically over-optimistic or pessimistic in our predictions for a given country, and adjusted for that, to account for the fact that we may be missing a factor specific to that country.382 We simply found how much the universal formula was off in the past on average (e.g., 1%) and assumed that it would be off by that amount over the next ten years. That adjustment is meant to account for unexplained factors. These two estimates typically don't yield meaningful differences

and typically don't affect the order of the countries' rankings. We don't know which one is better so we look at both. Overall, we expect India to grow fastest, followed by China, Singapore and Mexico. Our expectation is for the US and the UK to be among the fastest-growing developed nations and for Japan and southern European countries to be the slowest growing in the world.

<sup>382</sup> Note: In sectioning our misses, we realized that sometimes for a given country we were systematically over-optimistic about its growth or pessimistic. Overall these [biases](../../../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md) are pretty small but they also raise the question of whether we are missing a specific factor that is particularly important for that country (we know we can't capture everything). The correlation shown above of 84% includes our adjustment for these country-specific misses (for lack of a better term our 'error adjustment'). It's not a big deal—if we don't make this adjustment the correlation is 77% (i.e., a 77% correlation between our prediction for a country's growth in income per worker over the next decade and the growth in income per worker that materialized, across our sample of 20 countries and 159 datapoints). This allows us to show a type of range in our estimates for countries, which highlights what we have gotten wrong in the past and its magnitude.

#### **Aggregate Estimate of Future RGDP Growth**

![](Attachments/EconomicMachine_page_10_Figure_1.jpeg)

Because GDP is just output per worker times the number of workers, that estimate includes two major pieces: demographic trends (or more specifically the expected change in workers), and an estimate of future growth per worker. We show the chart of the expected change in workers first, below. On this measure, you can see that Europe, Russia and Japan's challenges are compounded by an aging and shrinking workforce, while countries like Mexico and India will enjoy a growth in workers as a support to their potential growth.

The next chart gives a picture of what we would project income growth per worker to be over the next 10 years, again highlighting our estimates with and without the error adjustment.

#### **Aggregate Estimate of Future Growth per Worker**

![](Attachments/EconomicMachine_page_12_Figure_1.jpeg)

Our future growth per worker estimate includes two major components: a productivity estimate, and an indebtedness estimate. We show both of these estimates below. They highlight the general attractiveness of the labor [arbitrage](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) between most emerging countries relative to the developed world. There is also much more room for these countries to [leverage](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) up whereas much of the developed world has reached its long term debt top and is deleveraging, which means there is much more limited room for spending and income growth to come from credit expansion.

Below, we describe in depth our measures of productivity-both what you pay for what you get, and culture.

#### Productivity and Competiveness Measures

Before getting more into our specific measures of productivity/competitiveness I want to start by reviewing our concepts pertaining to it.

**A country's competitiveness is driven by the value of all that it offers relative to the value of what others offer**  —most importantly the value of its people relative to their cost. In a [global economy](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Fewer%20Or%20Even%20None.md), countries that are more productive will not only produce better value products, but they will also attract [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and new businesses, and they will compel the means of production to move. We expect the producers who are more competitive to both 1) sell more in their own country and other countries, and 2) move their production to countries where they can produce more cost-effectively.

As explained, the most important way countries differentiate themselves is through their labor: whether it is more attractive for a company to hire their workers than to hire workers in a different country. This is not just a function of whether the workers are more productive today. It's a function of the attributes that make them more attractive to hire and invest in over the long term. Since ultimately the only way one can become more productive is through working harder or working smarter, it makes intuitive sense to us that education and work ethic are the most important attributes that matter. Those countries that offer these most cost-competitively tend to do the best. A country may also be more attractive because it's a cheap place to build a factory or because the [returns](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) of building new capital and technologies are higher. Additionally, countries that save and invest more tend to grow faster by creating new innovations, capital equipment and infrastructure that help improve the productivity of their workforce relative to other countries with more limited [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) rates.

These are the most important ingredients for the productivity growth of a country. But that's not all there is to it. Partly, culture drives the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week. But culture can also help explain why a country can appear to have the right ingredients for growth but consistently underperform.

**Culture matters a lot**. Ultimately how a country develops is a function of human behavior and the decisions its people make. Many of those decisions are captured in the attributes that go into a country's relative productivity (like how much people save or how hard they work). But you can learn a lot about the psychology of the different players in the economy and their motivations by staring at different cultural elements. Over very long stretches of time a country's cultural evolution is at the core of its long-term cycles (from being poor and believing it's poor to becoming rich). Over any decade, the way we think about culture is that it can help explain why a country can appear to have the right ingredients for growth but consistently underperform or outperform. For us it makes intuitive sense that countries that emphasize individual self-reliance and striving to achieve are more likely to succeed by creating a meritocratic environment where incentives are based largely on market forces. Countries can also outperform if they are more innovative in producing new products and ideas of value and more commercially minded in harvesting them. On the other hand, countries can underperform if they are corrupt or bureaucratic, or if the rule of law is unsound. To be clear, we are not assessing whether one culture is good or bad; our focus is on the cultural elements that are most important for economic prosperity.

## Our Productivity Gauge

For these reasons, when we look at gauging the productivity of a country we create a measure of 1) the relative value it offers and 2) its culture. We weigh the relative value of a country the most since it is the most important determinant.

Our productivity gauge is just based on the logic we have described. It is mostly a function of the relative value of a country's workers (the labor [arbitrage](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) aspect): how educated they are relative to their cost and how hard the people work relative to their cost. These measures give us a sense of whether a country's workers have the ingredients to grow their productivity by working harder or smarter. To triangulate the cost of an educated worker we look at two measures, one that adjusts for the quality of education and one that looks at their observed productivity today. Moving beyond a country's human capital, we also look at [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) relative to the cost, which gives us a lens into whether a country is investing to grow its productivity in the future and whether the [returns](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) are likely to be attractive (i.e., another perspective on the "cost of production [arbitrage](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md)").

To measure culture, we create a gauge for each of the concepts we have outlined: 1) whether a country values self-sufficiency, 2) whether it values savoring the fruits of life or achieving, 3) whether it is innovative and commercially oriented, 4) its degree of bureaucracy, 5) corruption and 6) rule of law. Self-sufficiency encourages productivity by tying the ability to spend to the need to produce. The concept of savoring life versus achieving captures how much the people in a country are focused on enjoying the things they have versus trying to increase their success and achieve, earn, and create more. Innovation and commercialism capture whether a society is oriented towards seeking profit or generating new insights. The last three get at the basic questions of how difficult it is to get business done in a country i.e., whether a given country is one where businesses could get off the ground and operate smoothly, where business can be conducted fairly (without corruption) and whether investors and businesses can be confident that contracts and laws will be well enforced.

Together our indicators of productivity were 64% related to countries' subsequent growth rates. To repeat, these estimates were made by applying the exact same factors to all countries in all time periods to determine their subsequent growth.

#### The chart below gives a picture of how we would rate countries today on productivity based on the same logic described above. Our ratings are represented in terms of what a given country's productivity would imply for that country's future growth in income per worker over the next 10 years.

According to our measures, India is best placed to see productivity growth at this point driven by a very cheap and achievement-oriented labor force, even accounting for poor education, chronic corruption and a generally ineffective system. Together these factors imply India has the ingredients to grow income per worker around 9% annually over the next decade. It also has sizable potential to boost its growth rate if it can reduce its inefficiencies through reforms. China is also highly competitive by our measures, with a growth rate implied by its competitiveness/productivity of about 6% or so. Its workforce is inexpensive and fairly well educated relative to its cost, works hard and provides huge savings for investments. Moreover, as a country that is becoming rich and starting to realize it, China has a huge amount of potential to realize by adopting existing technologies, building out its infrastructure in the underdeveloped parts of the country, and investing in businesses to serve a massive population that is quickly accumulating spending power. Nearly all developed world countries are measured to be relatively uncompetitive, with Italy, France, Spain and [Greece](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/Solutions/PSET%203%20Solution-Financial%20Instruments.md) uniquely uncompetitive for reasons that will be apparent in the indicators that follow. Most importantly, these countries' labor is expensive, they don't work that hard, and they invest less than most other countries. This is compounded by a social system that prioritizes savoring life over achieving and insulates workers from market forces with rigid labor markets and substantial government safety nets, low levels of innovation and high levels of bureaucracy. It should be noted that we are starting to see some structural reforms to improve productivity and competitiveness, especially in Spain, and that such reforms have the potential of considerably boosting growth because the barriers that reforms would bring down are such drags on growth. Japan is also somewhat uncompetitive but more because its labor is expensive and [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) levels stagnant, as opposed to cultural reasons (the work ethic in Japan and level of innovation, for example, remain quite supportive). In such cases, declines in the exchange rate can help. Also, Prime Minister Abe's "three arrow" policies can help a lot if pursued forcefully more forcefully than currently pursued. The US is the most competitive of the major developed countries we measure. Labor is more competitively priced compared to other developed countries (though expensive compared to many emerging countries), and the culture is supportive, including elements like relative hard work, a drive to achieve and orientation to innovate.

#### **Productivity Estimate of Future Growth**

The following two charts give you a summary of where countries stand on our assessment of value (i.e. what you pay for what you get) in each country and whether its culture are a support to or drag on income growth. Overall, the strong value proposition of Asia's workers especially how hard they work and their level of [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) relative to their expense-is supported by cultural attitudes around achievement. In contrast, Europe, once on the frontier of productivity, now invests little and takes more leisure than any other region. And after years of incomes rising faster than underlying productivity, its workers are some of the most expensive in the world and the vibrancy of its labor market is undermined by a system of protections. Japan and Singapore are in the middle of the pack when you look at their high cost of labor and low levels of [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), but we expect them to be helped by cultural factors (e.g., their orientation toward innovation and commercialism and rule of law). In contrast, cultural factors-like corruption, a desire for leisure over achievement-act as a drag for otherwise competitive workforces in Russia and Argentina. We will examine each of the components of these gauges next.**<sup>383</sup>**

**<sup>383</sup>**The r ght chart above shows the adjustment (or "bump") to the productivity estimate we make based on a country s culture (e g., based on our assessment of what you pay for what you get for Singapore's labor, we would project growth in income per worker of about 2.3%, but we add another 1.3% based on our assessment that Singapore's culture is very supportive to growth).

#### Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get

As previously discussed, a country's productivity and competitiveness are mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost and value of employees and b) the levels of [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively inexpensive and that have higher [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) rates grow faster than those that don't.

To construct this gauge we first looked at the average cost of an educated worker, adjusted for the average hours worked (including the average workweek, vacation time, and holidays) and adjusted for the quality of education (based on international tests). We also created a gauge of the productivity-adjusted cost of labor (a spot picture of how much workers offer relative to what you pay). And we created a gauge of working hard, where we look at the portion of the population working, and then how many hours each of those workers puts in (again adjusting for things like vacation). In addition, this gauge considers demographic shifts that change how much that society is of working age relative to those who are very young or old and dependent. We weighted these equally. This gives us perspective on the cost and value of employees. We also added in a gauge of savings and [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) that was also weighted equally. As shown in the correlations, all of these measures were individually highly effective predictors of future growth, as was the aggregate of them. On its own this gauge is 63% correlated to future growth. Most interesting are the individual country rankings by measure, which are shown in the charts that follow. We suggest picking a few countries that you are most interested in and seeing where they stand in these rankings. As we progress through the charts in this section, clear pictures will emerge.

#### India and China rank at the top of our measure of whether a country is cheap or expensive. India's work ethic is very strong, and they're investing a lot in their economy. And while their education scores in absolute terms are not very strong, their income levels are low enough to more than compensate. Before adjusting for cost, China scores better than India along most measures of what a country offers, but Chinese incomes have grown considerably over the last two decades and India's workforce is cheaper. The US scores toward the top of the developed countries thanks to a well-educated workforce that is fairly cheap compared to other developed countries. Spain rates better in the cut below, which doesn't weigh cultural elements like Spanish attitudes toward savoring life versus achieving and self-sufficiency. With labor that is expensive compared to workers of

similar education levels elsewhere, Germany and France are at the bottom of the list.

#### A Simple Measure of Cost: Per Capita Income

To make any assessment of value we want to look at the attributes of a country relative to their costs. Absent other indications of productivity or indications of what you get for workers, we'd expect relative income levels alone to give you some indication of a country's relative future growth, albeit a na'ive one. Through time, countries with cheap workers and low skills can [leverage](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) existing technology to increase their productive ability. Similarly, the richest countries generally do not continue to outperform the rest of the world, as their competitive advantages are eaten away by technology transfers to less competitive economies, and the normal behavior of most economies is to increasingly savor the fruits of success by working and investing less.

Our measure of cost simply compares the nominal GDP per capita of a given country relative to the developed world average in log terms, which we believe is more reflective of the impact of differences in income levels. That's based on our intuition that, from a competitiveness perspective, a \$2,000 difference is more meaningful between one country that makes \$500 and one that makes \$2,500 than between countries that make \$40,000 and \$42,000 respectively. Again, this measure of cost is one side of the picture. We combine it with our assessment of various indications of what a country offers to understand its productivity and competitiveness (what it offers relative to its cost).

Today, India is by far the lowest-cost country in our sample. Indian per capita GDP is about \$1500, which is much lower than that of many of the major developing world countries like China, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, or Korea. Even with its significant increase in cost in recent years, China's cost is still one of the lowest in the world. Its per capita income sits at just \$7,000, roughly 70% that of Mexico. However, the differences in cost by area are significant so that growth in China will largely depend on how development will occur in areas, and among people, that are inexpensive. While developed world countries in general have relatively high incomes, it's worth noting some differentiation between those countries for example, GDP per capita in the poorest European countries like Spain and [Greece](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/Solutions/PSET%203%20Solution-Financial%20Instruments.md) is only about two-thirds as high as the per capita incomes of the richest developed countries, like the US and Japan. You'll see below that based on how we look at cost, we don't make much of the difference in cost between the developed countries all are pretty expensive-but we believe there is a big difference between the cheapest emerging countries, like India and China, and the rest (including other countries like Argentina and Brazil).

#### Education

## Cost of a Quality Adjusted Educated Worker

Our single best measure of productivity is the relative cost of a country's educated workforce adjusted for the quality of that education. To construct our measure we look at the relative cost of different cohorts of educated workers (college, high school, those without education), allowing us to get closer to the individuals where the competition occurs. We can then look at the average cost of those workers per hour worked (adjusting for differences like vacation). Further, we take into account the quality of education in one country versus another (e.g., if a high school graduate in the US costs the same as one in France, we also want to ask whether the quality of high school education is the same in both countries). For this adjustment, we use an internationally accepted measure of education quality.384 That allows us to compare for a given cohort the relative quality of workers' education compared to the relative cost. To come up with an aggregate measure for a country we weight proportionally how much of its population is in each group because if a country's workforce is highly educated, then most of the labor competition happens with other countries at those levels (e.g., between the drug researcher in the US and their peers in Germany). Of course we recognize there is some labor [arbitrage](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) across cohorts but this approach lets us capture the dynamic reasonably well.

While there is, if anything, a negative relationship between a country's level of education and its level of future growth (because more expensive countries tend to have more educated people who are more expensive), there is a high correlation between the relative cheapness of a country's educated people and that country's subsequent growth rate. To convey how important it is to consider whether these educated people are expensive or cheap, consider that while there is a -17% correlation between the average level of a country's education and its future growth rate, there is a +66% correlation between cost-adjusted educated level and its future growth rate.

<sup>384</sup> Our measure of education quality is based on the education quality measures of the OECD's Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). PISA's assessments are designed to test the ability to apply knowledge rather than mastery of a specific curriculum. Our aggregate measure takes into account PISA's measures of education quality across mathematics, science and reading. While we would not put too much weight on the specific placement/ranking of a country, where countries place across the range is indicative. Over 65 countries participated in the most recent PISA section in 2012. The PISA surveys are designed in coordination with participating countries and reviewed to minimize cultural bias. In some cases, as in China, recent assessments have only been conducted in a few cities, which we make an adjustment for.

# We show our aggregate measure below on the right, next to our measure of education quality385 on its own for perspective. Overall, India looks to have the most attractively priced educated population, followed by China, with Russia and Mexico not far behind. Looking across education levels, workers in India with similar levels of education cost a fraction as much as their peers in the US (around 1/20th). When we adjust for the quality of education in India being about 50% worse on average, the cost of a quality-adjusted worker in India is still about 1/10th that of a worker in the US. This isn't all that different from how China's workers looked 20 years ago.

Remarkably, even as wages in China have risen substantially, so too have education levels and the quality of education—today the quality-adjusted cost of a worker in China is still highly attractive. Within the developed world, the US looks to have the most attractive educated workers, despite the quality of a US high school education now being worse than in other developed countries. In contrast, Europe's educated labor appears to be the most expensive in the world by this measure. Despite quality being relatively good, the cost of workers there, particularly below college level, is high.

<sup>385</sup> While we would not put too much weight in the specific placement/ranking of a country for educational quality, where countries place across the range is indicative.

Below we take a more granular look at our measure for each cohort of education level, which we use to build up to the aggregate picture. This approach gives us a much richer picture. For example, in the US college-educated workers adjusted for quality are more expensive than college-educated workers in Spain. But at the high school level and below, workers in the US are much cheaper than those in Spain. And since that's where the competition occurs between most workers for these countries, overall the US comes out more attractive. We show below some other points we find interesting.

### Cost of a Productivity Adjusted Educated Worker

To triangulate our picture of the cost of an educated worker, we also look at the cost adjusting for observed differences in productivity (output per hour worked) rather than education quality. With this measure, we take the same approach of looking at the cost of the different cohorts. By adjusting for differences in observed productivity today we can get a better sense of the effective cost. Imagine you hire two workers of the same cost: one has a better education, but the other is more productive from day one on the job. This measure helps us weigh that second perspective, though it is somewhat less correlated with future incomes than our qualityadjusted measure, about 49%. Our measures are below. The overall picture isn't all that different. India looks even stronger on this measure since their observed productivity is quite strong. In contrast, Japan falls lower down.

# Working Hard

Just like hard-working individuals, hard-working countries will generally be more productive and find ways to improve faster than those who are less hard working. We believe a country's work ethic impacts both the level of its relative advantage today and the pace at which it learns and improves over time. Working hard doesn't just mean working a lot of hours; it means having a certain ethic, a determination to achieve quality outcomes and to improve. Demographics can also impact the work ethic of a society-when a society ages and the number of dependents rises relative to those in the workforce, it can impact the overall work ethic of the society. Similarly, when there is a boom of young professionals, it can improve the vibrancy, initiative and determination of the society. We expect a country with a hard-working society that is low cost to be more competitive and grow faster than a country with a population that prefers leisure and is expensive.

To construct a simple measure of working hard, we look at two pieces, 1) average weekly hours of actual work by men in the labor force, adjusting for things like vacation time and holidays, and 2) shifts in the amount of the population as a whole that is working. While the number of hours worked is just one measure of the effort a country puts in, and doesn't account for the determination and effort put in during those hours, it gives us a decent starting point; we return to some other measures that triangulate our picture when we look at culture. Just using this gauge on its own yields a 53% correlation with future growth, but when combined with cost indications, it is 66% correlated with subsequent 10-year growth.

We look at our aggregate measure below first, followed by components. Emerging Asian workers are generally the hardest workers in the world, including China, India and Thailand. Mexico also stands out as particularly hard-working. Among the richer countries, Singapore is by far the hardest working (competitive with much poorer countries), and Japanese workers are some of the most hard-working of developed countries, followed by the English-speaking developed countries. Continental European workers are generally the least hard-working in the world. Adjusting for cost largely keeps these divergences in place, though India's relative cheapness makes it look more attractive.

## Working Hard Subcomponent: Average Hours Worked

When looking at whether a country works hard, we look at the portion of the population working, and then how many hours each of those workers puts in. Regrettably, we must look at this measure for just men in the labor force because different social norms across countries around women in the workforce distort the numbers, and we must adjust for things like labor force participation, vacation time and holidays where data is limited. Again, these measures are designed to be simple we triangulate them when we look at work ethic as part of the concepts of self -sufficiency and achievement orientation in our culture indicator.

When we look at hours worked on its own, Thailand, India and China are at the top, with Mexico not far behind and Singapore by far the hardest working of the wealthier countries. The Europeans work the least. Japanese workers, who used to be among the very hardest working in the world, still rank well on this metric but are now towards the middle. When we look at this measure of working hard adjusted for cost, we see some countries really stand out on either end-the dollar cost of effort, if you will, is particularly attractive in India, and especially bad in Europe.

## Working Hard Subcomponent: Demographics

There is a natural cycle to how hard a person works and what they contribute, and typically one's working years are the most hard-working and productive ones. So it follows that societies go through long ebbs and flows in terms of how hard they work in aggregate, based on how much of that society is of working age versus very young or old and dependent.

Demographic pressures are measured by the projected change in the dependency ratio over the next 10 years. This represents the projected rise or decline in the proport ion of a country's population that is young or old relative to those of working age. Our expectation is that a rise in the proportion of dependents (e.g., elderly individuals) would be a negative for the overall work effort in society and thereby for growth, all else equal.

In general, most major developed countries in the world today are likely to see a drag on their future growth in income per worker from these demographic shifts, due to increasingly aging populations. This impact is particularly acute for Japan but significant in the US, Europe, and UK. The picture is more mixed in the emerging world. Demographic pressures are a support in India but a drag in China, Russia and Korea, due to their aging populations. Adjusting for cost levels exacerbates the negative picture for the developed world. In the emerging world India is the one country that stands out as having a positive pressure after adjusting for cost; the pressure looks more muted in most of the rest, including China.

#### Investing

Countries that save and invest in their future tend to grow faster by creating capital equipment and infrastructure that helps improve the productivity of their workforce relative to other countries with more limited [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) rates. Further, high rates of savings provide the capital needed to invest in the most innovative companies. Of course, there are always risks that this [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is unproductive. Typically the investments that yield the most productivity gains occur in emerging countries that are just becoming rich. At this stage, the investments are not just inexpensive; the stock of infrastructure and other physical capital is also typically low and there is lots of room to adopt existing technologies that can radically improve the country's potential.

Investing is measured by looking at 1) the rate of total non-residential fixed [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in a given economy and 2) the household savings rate. Looking at investing on its own has historically had a 20% correlation with future growth, but when combined with cost it has had a 59% correlation with future growth.

The rate of Chinese [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and savings is the highest in the world, though increasingly inefficient. The development of modern infrastructure and increasing business [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) has been an important contributor to the productivity growth of the Chinese workforce over the last few decades though an increasing share of this [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is going to less productive uses. The UK, Japan and the US are on the lower end of investing rates for the developed world. Brazil, Hungary and Russia have some of the lowest [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) rates in the emerging world (with [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in Brazil and Hungary particularly depressed and much of the [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in Russia oriented toward resources and related infrastructure). When you consider how inexpensive it is to make investments in many emerging countries, how limited their existing stock of capital is, and how early they are in adopting existing technologies, not to mention building their own, India and China really stand out. On the flipside, we become more concerned about the US and Japan maintaining their technology advantage when we consider their expense and their lower levels of [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). (The innovativeness of countries is a question we return to in culture, and on that dimension both countries look more promising.)

## Investing Subcomponents: Aggregate Fixed Investment Rates

The impact of investing on long-term prosperity takes time to flow through, so when we look at [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) rates in a country we want to see what the trend has been, not just what happened recently. And we want to pay attention to the level of [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) rates, not the wiggles. Moreover, not all types of [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) produce income. While it's hard to assess that well, one thing we know is that real estate investments are generally not productivity enhancing, so we want to exclude those as best we can.

For these reasons we measure the rate of [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) for a given country by looking at the average level of fixed [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) as a percentage of GDP in the economy over the last seven years, stripping out residential real estate.

As highlighted above, on this measure China is ranked at the top. The US and Germany are towards the bottom-[investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) levels in those countries stagnated for some time. The impact of adjusting for cost puts India at the top just above China, but Germany and the US remain near the bottom, and Japan is modestly above them.

## Investing Subcomponents: Household Savings Rates

Savings provide financing for investments, so measuring savings provides another perspective into the resources a country has to productively invest. When you look at a country that is saving a lot when it is still poor, that is the period that its savings typically yield the highest productivity gains, for the reasons we have explained. Patterns of savings also relate to countries moving through the process described previously countries that are fast becoming rich tend to save a lot, and richer countries past their peak tend to draw down their savings.

We measure the propensity for households to save by looking at average household savings as a percentage of household income over the last seven years.

Once again, China and India rank at the top for household savings. Major European countries measure as having fairly high household savings rates relative to other developed countries, while household savings rates in the US are notably lower. Adjusting for cost levels again exacerbates the differences between the emerging and developed world along this dimension, with the high level of Indian and Chinese savings standing out and savings rates in the US and Japan quite low.

#### Culture Components

Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform. While some people shy away from examining culture because it is perceived as a sensitive subject and/or that it's difficult to measure, I think those views are mistaken. I don't see any reason why we shouldn't look at culture objectively as we do any other element of an economy; also, it can be well measured. I think that it's unfortunate that this important influence on economic well-being has not been well studied.

To be clear, I don't mean to judge whether a culture is good or bad any more than I could judge whether working hard is a better way to live one's life than savoring the pleasures of life. I am, however, confident that people who prefer savoring life over working hard will work and produce differently in ways that we should understand. Similarly, it makes intuitive sense that countries that emphasize individual self-reliance and striving to achieve are more likely to succeed than countries that don't. Countries can also outperform if the people in them are more innovative in producing new products and ideas of value and more commercially minded in harvesting them. It makes fundamental sense that countries will underperform if they are corrupt, bureaucratic or if the rule of law is unsound. In this section we will look at the relationships between measures of such factors and future growth, and we will examine how different countries stack up against these measures and what that implies for their future growth rates.

Some additional observations worth noting are as follows: people in poorer countries typically appear to value achieving because they need to work hard to sustain themselves, but as countries get richer, people tend to put more emphasis on enjoying their success. On an individual level, people spend more time relaxing; nationally, you can see it in countries turning away from policies that maximize growth towards policies that try to make society more equal or protect the environment. There is a strong correlation between the quality of a system's institutions (whether the system works) and a country's level of income. Similarly, richer countries seem more innovative because they can afford to invest more in conducting research or educating researchers, and developed capital markets in rich countries make it easier to start businesses and reap the potential rewards.

Our goal with the culture indicator is to capture the essence of whether a country's culture is conducive to growth, regardless of the influence of their stage of development. So, for each dimension of our culture gauge, we take out the effect of income on that dimension (using income as a proxy for the country's development stage).

For the reasons we have described above, the culture gauge focused on the elements of culture we believe matter most for a country's future growth: 1) self-sufficiency, 2) savoring life versus achieving, 3) whether their society fosters innovation and commercialism, 4) bureaucracy, 5) corruption and 6) rule of law. For simplicity we put equal weight on each of our culture indicators, which balances measures related to the motivations of the individual and how the system operates. Because we took out the effect of income, each of the pieces is correlated to growth without being correlated at all to the income level of the country. The table below summarizes our weighting of the various gauges. Overall this gauge is about 58% correlated with future growth.

#### Again, the way we think about culture is that a country's competitiveness and productivity is mainly a function of its value proposition, but culture can be a drag or additional boost. So we use our gauge of culture to adjust our measure of a country's productivity by shifting it up or down based on whether the country's culture is likely to be a pressure for the country to perform above or below its potential (we call it a "bump" for lack of a better term).

Below we look at our culture indicator's current readings before diving into its individual pieces and describing in more depth our logic behind them.

Culture shifts our predictions for future growth some. Based on this gauge, culture is the strongest support to growth in Asia, particularly in Singapore, India, Thailand, Korea, and China. Singapore's culture is strong across all four of our measures. In contrast, China's institutions aren't nearly as effective (due to bureaucracy and corruption), but China's culture shows an extremely strong work ethic, desire to achieve and self sufficiency. For Korea, its orientation toward innovation and work ethic offset relatively weak institutions. The US stands just behind Korea with a highly innovative spirit and achievement orientation, but with a system that prioritizes redistribution over maximiz ing growth. Culture is a more moderate support in Japan, more neutral in the rest of the English-speaking developed world and Germany, and a drag in Latin America and most European countries, especially the periphery. In Europe's periphery, corruption, a focus on savoring life, relatively low self-sufficiency, and stagnant commercial and scientific environments appear to be a material drag on growth. Russia and Argentina, two of the countries where our measures of what you pay versus what you get are attractive, also score near the bottom of the list because of corruption in Russia, and low self-sufficiency and a high value on

savoring life relative to achieving in Argentina.**<sup>386</sup>**

<sup>386</sup>Again, what we are showing is the adjustment (or "bump") to the productivity estimate we make based on a country s culture (e.g., based on our assessment of what you pay for what you get for Singapore's labor, we would project growth in income per worker of about 2.3%, but we add another 1.3% based on our assessment that Singapore's culture is very supportive to growth).

### Self-Sufficiency

It is both logical and consistent with the evidence to believe that self-sufficiency (i.e., the need and the ability to independently support oneself) is an important ingredient for individuals and societies to be successful. It is not controversial to say that people spend the money that they earn differently than the money that others give them—i.e., that the connection between earning and spending is a healthy one. If people have to earn money to spend it, they have to be more productive. Over the long run, living standards rise as a function of increases in productivity. So, it is not a big leap to presume that countries with greater amounts of self-sufficiency do better than those with less. Since self-sufficiency creates capability and independence in addition to fostering increased production, it also produces self-esteem. For these reasons, it is logical to conclude that self-reliance is rewarding, both economically and psychologically. The evidence clearly shows this to be true.

Below, we show how self-sufficiency varies by country and how it has been correlated with subsequent economic growth. You will see that there are significant differences in self-sufficiency levels between countries and that these differences occur for different reasons. For example, in some cases they are chosen (e.g., the amounts of transfer payments developed economies have are largely chosen) while in other cases they are not (e.g., high self-sufficiency in the poorest societies is primarily the result of necessity rather than choice). Nonetheless, the evidence is clear. Societies in which individuals are more responsible for themselves grow more than those in which they are less responsible for themselves.

To measure self-sufficiency, we weigh 50% how hard a society works and 50% the system of supports and protections, which is a function of the magnitude of government supports and how rigid labor markets are (e.g., how easy it is to hire and fire). While no one of these perfectly measures self-sufficiency, together they paint a picture that is highly indicative. Once we used the process below to construct a score, we took out the role income plays in encouraging self-sufficiency and used the resulting measure in our culture indicator. Overall our indicator of self-sufficiency is about 42% correlated to growth once you strip out the effect income has on selfsufficiency. Prior to excluding the income effect, our indicator of self-sufficiency was about 50% correlated to future growth.

 Note: the correlation of transfers to future growth is for a shorter time period and smaller sample set, and will have some bias because of countries with lower growth having higher transfers.

The charts below convey those countries that are most self-sufficient today. As shown, India and Singapore are measured as most self sufficient, followed by other Asian countries and Mexico. The US is towards the middle, and European countries are the least self -sufficient. The chart below shows these ratings. Look at it to see if you are surprised and note those surprises so that you can see what they are attributable to when we show you the composition of our barometer. For example, you might find it notable that "communist" China has greater selfsufficiency than the capitalist US. This is the case in both outright terms and once you adjust for income.

# Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Work Ethic

Societies that are self-sufficient have a high percentage of their population working hard each day to be selfreliant. People who work hard both produce more in the near-term and generally find ways to improve faster through time than those that care more for leisure. They also tend to exhibit a drive to earn what they consume, which is an essential quality of being self-reliant and generally successful in a market-based system.

While we think average hours worked accomplished our basic goal within productivity of getting a gauge of how hard people worked, here we wanted to capture a little more richness about the work ethic of each country, so we also looked at measures like the typical retirement age, how many vacation days people in each country typically take and male labor force participation on its own. Again, regrettably we must look at our hours worked and labor force measures for just men because different social norms across countries around women in the workforce distort the numbers. Since we expect richer countries to take more leisure than poorer ones, this is one of the measures we expect to have a fairly strong relationship with a country's income level.

When we scan across countries, we see emerging countries at the top of the list, including India and Mexico. Overall, emerging Asia comes through as working the hardest, followed by Latin America. Among rich countries, Singapore and then Japan have the hardest workers. The US is fairly hard-working among developed countries, whereas workers in Europe appear to opt for leisure more than anyone else based on these measures. Once we take into account the tendency for wealthier countries to take more leisure time, Japan really stands out as exceptionally hard-working (as do Korea and Singapore). Argentina and Brazil move down a bit. Still, the relative ordering of most countries is fairly stable since the differences in how hard each country works are fairly extreme. Any way you cut it, Mexico and India remain among the hardest-working countries and workers in Europe some of the most leisure taking.

# Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Work Ethic - Average Hours Worked

Hard work is a sign that someone is driven to be self -reliant, that he or she has grit. This determination is essential to having a society where self-sufficiency is promoted and rewarded. A simple way to see it is just by looking at how many hours those who have a job put in. This gives us a sense of how hard-working the employed members of a society are (and, more loosely, the society in aggregate). Below we zoom in on the simple measure: the average work week (we triangulate our picture with a broader set of measures next). On this measure we see emerging countries at the top of the list, including Thailand, India, and China. Overall, emerging Asia comes through as working the hardest, followed by Latin America. Among rich countries, Singapore and then Japan have the hardest workers. The US is fairly hard-working among developed countries, whereas workers in Europe appear to opt for leisure more than anyone else based on these measures.

# Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Work Ethic - Labor Force Participation

Remember what we are trying to get at with this concept is the work ethic of a society, not just how much it is actually working. Labor force participation is one indication (albeit crude) of how much a society wants to work. It gives you a rough sense of what proportion of the society is actively looking for a job (though it may miss some who have the drive but are in the informal economy). Because of cultural differences across countries and data limitations, here again we are unfortunately limited to looking at male labor force participation. By and large the emerging world has much higher male labor force participation rates than the developed world, though there are exceptions. Brazil, India, Thailand, Mexico and China have some of the highest rates (all around 80%). There is still a high participation of men in the workforce in Singapore (above 75%), despite its wealth. Japan has a high male labor force participation rate among developed countries (above 70%, though its female participation is low compared to other developed countries). This measure is a bit lower in the US and UK. Labor force participation is lowest among men in Western Europe, particularly Italy, France and [Greece](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/Solutions/PSET%203%20Solution-Financial%20Instruments.md) (60% to 65%), though Germany and Spain are not far behind, along with parts of Eastern Europe, especially Hungary.

#### Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Work Ethic - Actual Vacation Time

How much vacation a society takes each year is just another intuitive measure of how much it values leisure versus hard work and its rewards. When we look at this measure, the picture isn't all that different from what we have seen so far. Japanese workers appear to take very few vacations (about one week per year on average), consistent with a strong work ethic reflected in our other measures. India and China are toward the top of the list, with the average vacation time around two weeks per year. The norm in the US is about three-and-a-half weeks. German, French and Spanish workers appear to take the most vacation, with Italian and Greek workers not far behind. On average, Europeans take six to seven weeks of vacation per year.

# Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Work Ethic - Retirement Age as Percentage of Life Expectancy

One dimension of how hard you work is how many days you put in each year, but another is how long you work over the course of your lifetime. To capture this we want to look at when people tend to retire in a society relative to their life span. We measured this by looking at the effective retirement age as a percentage of life expectancy. Interestingly, this picture shows some notable differences from the earlier patterns we saw and appears less related to a country's income (a simple measure of its stage of economic development). While the countries at the top are mostly emerging, Japan and the US are ahead of many low-income countries. Japanese and US workers appear to work to 85% or more of their life expectancy before retiring. On the other hand, workers in China retire much earlier, working closer to 70% of their life expectancy before retirement. Consistent with other measures, Europeans fall in the bottom half of this measure.

# Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Government Supports

A country's government policy both tells you something about what it values, and also shapes the incentives and motivations of its citizens. In general, societies that value self -reliance highly will provide less public support. And large government supports, directly through transfers that redistribute incomes or indirectly through services, are the primary means of enabling individuals to consume more than they earn. These supports risk undermining self -reliance, which is such a fundamental value in a market-based system (i.e., the drive to earn your keep). To be clear, we aren't arguing for or against such payments; we are just measuring self -sufficiency and, since this is one of the biggest influences on it, it is a significant part of our gauge. For these reasons, we would expect countries that have fewer transfers, smaller welfare systems and more limited social services to grow faster than those that place a higher priority on redistribution and government safety nets.

We measure the degree of government supports in a society in a few ways, looking at the magnitude of its outlays (which often include indirect transfers in the way of ser vices, for example) and the magnitude of its direct transfers to households. As countries develop and get richer, they tend to weigh considerations like redistribution more heavily, so this is another measure where we expect and find a fairly strong relationship between the country's income and its level of government supports, which we control for to account for the stage of development the country is in and get a sense of the underlying ethic.

In our current rankings, emerging Asia holds the top four spots, with European countries ranking as the least self sufficient along this measure. Once you exclude the effect of income, this pattern basically holds, though the developed English-speaking world moves up some, particularly Singapore, whose limited amount of government supports is unusual given the wealth of the country. Italy and France end up looking particularly bad on this measure.

# Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Government Supports - Government Expenditures

Government outlays are a broad indication of the supp ort a government provides to those in society. While not direct (as, say, pure household income transfers), many of these outlays are redistributive, providing, for example, higher-value services than what a number of recipients contributed in the form of taxes. These measures can both reflect societal attitudes around self -reliance and impact these values. On this measure, we see that many of the emerging Asian countries have very small governments relative to the size of their economies. Singapore's government spends a bit over 15% of GDP, and China's government doesn't spend that much more, about 20%. India is a bit lower down but still in the top quartile, with government spending around 25% of GDP. There is some variation among Latin American countries, with Mexico's government outlays at less than 25% of GDP, and Argentina's and Brazil's governments closer to 35%-40%, around the middle of the pack. Japan and the US are also in the middle. France and Italy are on the other end of the spectrum. Their governments spend between 50% and 55% of GDP.

**Government Expenditures (% of PGDP)** 

# Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Government Supports - Transfers to Households

Household transfers are a direct subsidy and have an especially high risk of undermining self reliance. The policy highlights the tradeoff of enforcing a market-based system to maximize growth versus risking slower growth to achieve a different goal, like ensuring a social safety net for ethical reasons or for social stability. On this measure, we see that India's and China's governments are the least redistributive, by our measures. In both countries transfers to households are around 5% of GDP. Transfers in the US and Japan are about four times larger, around 20% of GDP, but still much lower relative to the rest of the developed world. In Western Europe, transfers range from a bit under 25% to nearly 30% in France.

# Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Labor Market Rigidity

Support from the state to an individual can happen through either direct transfer payments and the provision of government services (as we examined above), or by regulating companies to provide workers with supports, e.g., enforcing a minimum wage or making it difficult to fire individuals. Unions can also work to protect certain workers. To the extent that these structural labor market supports limit companies from engaging with employees in a free manner (making hiring and firing decisions), it limits the need for individual self -reliance. And this approach limits the dynamism of corporations and individuals to respond to conditions-which over time should make countries with high rates of labor market rigidity grow more slowly.

We measure labor market rigidity by looking at unionization rates across countries, minimum wages, and limits to hiring and firing at will in a given economy. Unlike hard work or government supports, these measures tend to be fairly unrelated to a country's wealth and stage of development (which we proxy with income levels).

On our aggregate measure of labor force rigidity, Singapore, India and the US rank as having the least rigid labor forces, followed by Mexico. Argentina and Italy score especially poorly along this measure. Within the developed world, Japan and peripheral Europe appear to have some of the more rigid labor markets. It's also interesting to note that China appears to have a fairly rigid labor market, which is generally the exception (most other measures indicate that China has a high degree of self -sufficiency). Since labor force rigidity isn't particularly related to a county's stage of development, excluding income's effect has little impact on the rankings.

# Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Labor Market Rigidity - Unionization

While unions can help give workers a voice in negotiations with their employers, they also work to protect members from the pressures of others in the workforce and restrict overall labor force participation-all of which undermines self-reliance. As with other measures of labor market rigidity, unionization rates have little relationship with the income of a country. The measure shows different choices within countries of similar income. Unionization rates are low in the US and Mexico (close to 15% and below), though it's worth noting that our measures don't account for the strength of unions (which we understand to be strong in France, for example). Unionization rates are very high in Italy, Russia and Argentina (35% and higher). This is one of the few measures on which China ranks lower, with a unionization rate near 30%.

# Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Labor Market Rigidity - Ease of Hiring and Firing

Government protections that make it harder to hire or fire someone both increase the rigidity in the labor market and reduce the self-sufficiency of its workers. Looking at ease of hiring/firing, the US and Singapore rate as some of the most self-sufficient developed countries, and among the most self-sufficient of any country on this measure. China is not far behind, still in the top quartile. Protections against firing appear to be high in Europe, though Spain has made great strides in improving labor market flexibility through reforms over the last couple years. Protections against firing also appear high in Latin America Argentina, Brazil and Mexico are all in the lower half.

# Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Labor Market Rigidity - Minimum Wage as Percentage of Average Income

The minimum wage of a country is another indication of its labor market rigidity and emphasis on supports versus market-based incentives and self-reliance. As with unionization rates, we again see quite a bit of difference across countries even within the same income group. Mexico tops the list, with the US and Germany not far behind. On the other end we see both developed countries, like Italy, and lower-income ones, like China and Argentina, that have much higher minimum wages as a percentage of incomes.

#### Savoring Life Versus Achieving

It makes intuitive sense to us that those who value achievement over savoring the fruits of life will be more successful in finding ways to work harder and smarter to become more prosperous. Of course achievement means different things to different people. When I talk about a society that values achievement I imagine one where its people prioritize professional success, creating thriving businesses and building economic security versus other goals like protecting the environment or enjoying leisure. What's more, these societies tend to be ones where there is a faith that competition is fair and hard work will be rewarded (otherwise it's less likely for the people to be motivated).

To calculate our "savoring life versus achieving" gauge we put 50% weight on the measures of whether the culture values working hard and 50% on the values expressed in an international values survey. For the first component (the evidence we see of work ethic in things like hours worked or vacation days), we draw on the broad measure of working hard that we discussed as part of self-sufficiency. For the latter component, the expressed values of society, survey data is difficult to compare across countries, so we triangulated with several different questions that were consistent with our goal of capturing the desire of people to savor what they have or focus on achieving more. For example, we used answers to questions like, "what should the first priority be for the future of the country," or "economic growth is more important than the environment," to get at how people value further success or economic growth in relation to other values (like the environment, people having more say in their communities, etc.). We also look at questions about whether having a good time is important relative to accomplishing and whether the respondent thinks it's important to be successful, which are somewhat more direct. Lastly, questions like "competition is harmful" help us get a sense of people's attitudes toward the type of environment that encourages people to push to achieve. These were combined into our overall indicator of the relative [preference](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Utility%20Indices.md) for savoring life versus achieving in a way that is indicated by the weights shown below. As with self-sufficiency, there is a natural tendency for people in less developed countries to value becoming more prosperous through hard work and achievement, compared to developed countries which are more inclined towards leisure. Once we take into account the level of a country's income, our indicator of savoring life versus achieving is about 40% correlated to growth.

When we look at the picture of which countries prioritize achievement over savoring, we see the familiar countries at the top and bottom—East Asia and the European periphery, respectively. India and Mexico score as being most focused on achieving. The most achievement-oriented countries in the developed world are the US and Japan by these measures. European countries focus more on savoring life than most countries in the world, with France and Italy at the bottom. The positions change some once we take into account the effect of income, though not all that much (the differences between the extremes are also smaller). Singapore moves up to the top spot—when you take into account how wealthy the country is, it's remarkable how hard-working and achievement-oriented its people appear by our measures. India still ranks toward the top after taking into account its income level, but its relative achievement orientation stands out as less exceptional.

# Savoring Life Versus Achieving Subcomponents: Observed Outcomes

One straightforward way to see whether a society values achieving over leisure is to observe the outcomes of its choices: literally how much effort they put into work. A society whose people strive hard to achieve in a marketbased system will likely have a more vibrant, competitive business environment. These traits will make it more likely to improve its potential than an economy which chooses to value the fruits of life instead. Often we will see countries that have acquired great wealth and become rich begin to make this choice.

For the observed piece of the concept of savoring life versus achieving, we use our broad measure of how hardworking a country is. (As discussed, this is the same broad measure we use as part of self -sufficiency, so if it is fresh in your mind you can skip down to the expressed values of this indicator.) As a reminder, this measure includes a broad set of indications of a country's work ethic, including not just the average hours worked, but also measures like the typical retirement age, how many vacation days people in each country typically take, and male labor force participation on its own. Again, regrettably we must look at our hours worked and labor force measures for just men because different social norms across countries around women in the workforce distort the numbers. Since we expect richer countries to take more leisure than poorer ones, this is one of the measures we expect to have a fairly strong relationship with a country's income level.

When we scan across countries, we see emerging countries at the top of the list, including India and Mexico.

Overall, emerging Asia comes through as working the hardest, followed by Latin America. Among rich countries, Singapore and then Japan have the hardest workers. The US is fairly hard-working among developed countries, whereas workers in Europe appear to opt for leisure more than anyone else based on these measures. Once we take into account the tendency for wealthier countries to take more leisure time, Japan really stands out as exceptionally hard-working (as do Korea and Singapore). Argentina and Brazil move down a bit. Still, the relative ordering of most countries is fairly stable, since the differences in how hard each country works are fairly extreme. Any way you cut it, Mexico and India remain among the hardest-working countries and workers in Europe some of the most leisure taking.

## Savoring Life Versus Achieving Subcomponent: Expressed Values

Observing the outcomes of people's choices is one way to see whether they value achievement over savoring; another, of course, is to ask them. You can imagine the questions you would ask. Some of the ones that are intuitive to us are whether a society puts growth as a top priority for the country, whether it believes competition is healthy and at a personal level whether each individual feels being very successful is important and that hard work will lead to success. Fortunately, there is a World Values Survey that asks many questions and includes ones like this. Naturally there are challenges comparing survey data across countries, but we believe by triangulation across a set of intuitive questions we can come up with a pretty good indication of a country's expressed values, which we can then weigh against the outcomes we observe (which form the other half of our savoring life versus achieving gauge, as discussed above).

In fact, the rankings for the expressed component show a similar picture as those we observe in measures of work effort. India and China top this gauge for the emerging world, and Latin America is further down the list. Of the developed world, the US values achieving most, while France and the European periphery place the most emphasis on savoring life. This gauge is less correlated with incomes than observed measures of work effort, which makes some sense as observed measures are a more direct way of seeing a country's values (e.g., you can value savoring the fruits of life but work out of necessity). When you exclude the effect of income, the US moves to the top of achievement-oriented countries, with India just behind.

![](Attachments/EconomicMachine_page_51_Figure_3.jpeg)

The table below shows more specific information which we triangulated to get a sense of the expressed values toward achievement versus savoring in a given society. It's interesting how the reasons for these cultural attitudes differ across countries. For example, in Russia people express a lack of faith that hard work leads to success, even though they express a desire for the country to grow, while in Canada people express a high value on political input or environmental protection over economic growth. That said, we don't want to make too much of any one of these indications, since what we are trying to capture is the overall essence of whether a country is achievement-oriented.

#### Innovation and Commercialism

An innovative and commercial spirit is the lifeblood of a thriving economy. The drive to tinker and invent, to discover, to improve from prior failures—this is how people learn and find new and better ways of creating things of value. In a market-based system, the most powerful way to drive innovation is to bring new ideas to market, to commercialize and profit from them. The marketplace is generally efficient in weeding out the good ideas from the bad and [pricing](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) what innovations are most valued by society. In this way the concepts of innovation and commercialism go hand in hand. They capture whether people in a society value finding new knowledge or creating new things, and whether their incentives are aligned to encourage them to seek a profit by commercializing these ideas. The following statistics measure the level of innovation and commercialism in different countries and their correlations with future growth.

We looked at a variety of measures to triangulate these concepts. For both scientific and commercial innovation, we wanted to have a balance between indicators that captured *outputs* (new inventions or businesses), and indicators that measured *inputs* (values, [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), and people) that we thought would logically lead to innovation. We weigh the inputs and outputs equally. The pieces of our innovation and commercialism indicator are shown in the following table. Overall, the raw indications of innovation and commercialism are stronger in higher-income countries, especially measures of [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) (like R&D expenditure) that require a certain level of resources, or measures of knowledge creation (like patent creation) that require a level of acquired knowledge. What we are focused on with our culture measures, however, are the underlying values of a society independent of its wealth and development stage (which we proxy in a simple way with income levels). Once we exclude the effect of income, our gauge of innovation and commercialism is 49% correlated to historical future growth in income per capita. It's notable that before this adjustment there is no relationship between a country's future growth and the level of observed innovation and commercialism.

On the next page we show our current measures for the aggregate indicator with and without the effect of income, as well as for the components of our indicator. Where applicable we look at each measure that goes into these gauges relative to the number of people in the society or the size of the economy.

In terms of our ratings of countries on this gauge, Korea and the US rank as being the most innovative and commercial-minded both on an absolute basis and after we take out the effect of income. Korea invests a lot of capital and people toward research and has reaped the rewards in the form of a high number of new patents and royalties. Along with relatively high [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in research, Americans stand out as highly entrepreneurial. Germany and Japan aren't far behind, each investing high amounts of R&D and researchers into the innovation process and seeing the benefits from things like new patents, businesses, and websites. China is roughly neutral on our measures on an absolute basis, but it jumps to the top third once you take into account the fact that its proportion of people creating new businesses and gross expenditure in R&D are fairly high given how poor it still is. India is less innovative but it's much poorer, so it moves ahead of China once you adjust for the effect of income. Latin America and emerging Europe score in the middle to bottom end of the range whether you adjust for the effect of income or not, especially Russia and Mexico. Once you adjust for income, Europe's periphery fares poorly, particularly Italy, which is at the bottom of the list. Mostly, their innovation and commercial *inputs*  like researchers or entrepreneurship prevalence are moderate, but those aren't leading to the scientific or business *outputs* you'd expect for countries at their income level.

### Innovation and Commercialism Subcomponent: Outputs

We would expect a country that has more innovative and commercially minded people to create more patents and trademarks, more businesses-in other words, that it is actively creating new ideas, protecting its intellectual property and capturing the rewards of this innovation. So we look at these outcomes as one way to get a sense of the society's innovative and commercial spirit. Some outcomes are more directly indicative of innovation (like patent creation), others more direct signs of commercialism (like new businesses created or the prevalence of entrepreneurs), and some show the signs of combining the two (like royalty fees).

When we look at these measures on their own, they are fairly related to a country's income, which is intuitive since rich countries tend to have more resources to invest and have higher levels of education and accumulated knowledge, so are more likely to lead in creating innovations valued in the market. On the raw measures, you see many poor countries at the bottom, like India or China (that might have a strong innovative spirit but you wouldn't expect to be leading innovators right now) behind rich countries, like France or Italy, that may actually have less drive to find new ideas and build businesses. But when we adjust for income, both India and China move up a lot, especially India, which appears just as innovative and commercial as the US when you account for its stage of development. Either way you look at it, the US tops our scores for the outputs of innovation and commercialism. After taking out the effect of income, rich countries like the US and Japan still stand out as highly innovative. The European periphery countries ([Greece](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/Solutions/PSET%203%20Solution-Financial%20Instruments.md), Spain and Italy) have the worst scores once you adjust for how few new commercial innovations they're producing in light of how rich they are. France, Brazil, and Russia are just behind.

### Innovation and Commercialism Subcomponent: Inputs

Ultimately what matters for commercial innovation is whether there is a strong spirit of finding new things and building new businesses in the society. Whether a country is investing its resources in new innovations and whether it has a culture of risk-taking are good signs this spirit is strong. So to measure the inputs to innovation we look at human and capital [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) through R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP and the proportion of researchers in the population. We look at entrepreneurial spirit by examining whether people express a fear of failing in a new business endeavor in surveys and whether there is a prevalence of entrepreneurs in the population.

As with the outputs of innovation, the innovation inputs we measure are highly correlated to income, again to be expected since richer countries have more resources and higher levels of education to devote to finding new ideas. To account for this and get at the underlying spirit of innovation and commercialism we simply take out the effect of income. Here again we see India and China behind many rich countries on our raw indicators, and then at the top of the list after taking into account their level of income; on the other hand, certain rich countries are at the bottom of the list after excluding the effect of income for example, Italy and France. As observed when we looked at its score on our outcomes measure, Korea has the highest score for inputs to innovation and commercialism. That's because it devotes a high amount of spending and people to research while also having a healthy amount of entrepreneurship (despite some apparent fear of business failure). Within the developed world, the US, Germany and Japan stand out as the countries most oriented toward innovation and commercialism, near the top of all countries. Japan stands out because of the resources it devotes-its level of researchers relative to its population and R&D expenditure which outweigh an apparent fear of business failure. The US, on the other hand, is strong on all measures, with a healthy willingness to take risk.

#### Bureaucracy

Lots of red tape and government regulation stymie business activity. They impact the core elements of a thriving economy by hindering people from innovating or creating new businesses, and they make running a business burdensome, requiring people to spend time complying with unnecessary or heavy administrative controls instead of focusing on business improvements. That's not to say that regulation is not important—of course good governance and the rule of law are critical to a healthy market-based economy, as we will examine next. But excessive, time-consuming and rigid controls gum up the wheels of the economy.

To measure bureaucracy we look at measures related to the ease of starting a business (from the World Bank/IFC), the efficiency and cost of dealing with construction permits (also World Bank/IFC) and the burden of government regulation (from the World Economic Forum). The pieces of our bureaucracy indicator are shown in the table below. Bureaucracy tends to be more prevalent in less developed countries and so is fairly related to income levels. This is fairly natural for a number of reasons, because the processes are simply less efficient and require more steps, because the market systems are less advanced or established and have more controls, or because of inter-related factors, like weaker rule of law and a higher degree of corruption leading to more controls that allow for rent seeking. From a growth perspective, businessmen and investors will likely accept that a certain degree of bureaucracy is to be expected to do business in an emerging country that is otherwise competitive. But if the bureaucracy is exceptional even relative to countries of similar income, it is no doubt going to weigh on the decision to do business in that country. Once excluding the effect of income, our gauge of bureaucracy is 32% correlated to historical future growth in income per capita. Notably, it is negatively correlated to future growth when we don't make this adjustment. Along with our measures of the rule of law and corruption, this gauge helps us triangulate the picture of how hard it is to do business in a country.

Before taking into account income levels, Singapore ranks best on our gauge of bureaucracy, followed by the English-speaking developed world. Nowhere is it easier to start a business or run one without burden from government regulation than in Singapore according to our measures. Bureaucracy is worst in Argentina and India and high in Russia, Brazil and China as well. Once you exclude the relationship between income and bureaucracy, India and China don't look quite as bad, though still below par. Europe's periphery (Spain, [Greece](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/Solutions/PSET%203%20Solution-Financial%20Instruments.md), and Italy) all look highly bureaucratic given their stage of development. Italy ranks near the bottom due in particular to the burden government regulations place on doing business. Russia scores poorly considering its income, just a touch above Argentina.

#### Corruption

Corruption undermines the effectiveness of a market-based system in a variety of ways, diverting resources, distorting incentives, raising the costs of doing business, undermining business competition and efficiency, and creating uncertainty for [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). Corruption also both discourages profit-seeking and often impedes it. Small types of corruption (like the bribes one may have to pay at the airport or to an administrative official) create inefficiencies that slow down the agility of businesses, raise costs and make it more difficult to cultivate a new business. Big forms of corruption (for example, business appropriation) create limits to financial success and others (like large bribes to enter an industry or win a license) create entry barriers and lower prospective [returns](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md). All forms can make a country's system dysfunctional and create uncertainty around doing business in a given country. In all these ways corruption undermines productivity and the capacity of a society to realize its potential.

To measure corruption, we combine Transparency International's measures of corruption across countries with three sub-indices from the World Economic Forum's competitiveness index: "diversion of public funds," "irregular payments and bribes," and "favoritism in decisions of government officials." These measures help us capture the different types of corruption (big and small). The pieces of our corruption indicator are shown in the table below. When we look at these measures we see that poorer countries tend to have higher degrees of corruption. That's for a number of reasons we won't explore in depth here, including fewer opportunities for wealth creation, entrenched ways of operating that may have once been part of a different, non-market based system, or weaker rule of law. Businessmen and investors will likely put up with a certain degree of corruption to operate in an emerging country that is otherwise competitive. But if that country has an exceptionally high degree of corruption relative to countries of similar income, it is no doubt going to weigh on the decision to do business in that country. Once excluding the effect of income, our gauge of corruption is 58% correlated to historical future growth in income per capita. Notably, the relationship is slightly negative without this adjustment. Along with our measures of bureaucracy and the rule of law, this gauge helps us triangulate the picture of how hard it is to do business in a country.

|                                                 | Correlation to |        |

Before taking into account the income level of countries, Singapore again looks best, with Japan, the Englishspeaking developed world, and Germany also near the top. Most emerging countries are toward the bottom of our rankings, which is to be expected given the relationship between corruption and income levels we have discussed. When we exclude how income levels are related to corruption, Latin American countries and the European periphery are at the bottom of our ratings. Italy and [Greece](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/Solutions/PSET%203%20Solution-Financial%20Instruments.md) stand out as having the highest degree of corruption of any of the countries we look at, followed by Russia and Argentina just behind. Italy is weak across all measures, especially given how wealthy it is, and particularly with regard to favoritism by government officials. India and China both face significant impediments from their levels of corruption. But when we consider their levels of corruption relative to their levels of income, their corruption is not exceptional; in fact, it's lower than we would expect. Even after considering income levels, many developed countries still rate high, Singapore in particular, but also commonwealth countries, Japan, and Germany. The US rates in the bottom third after

considering its income.

#### Rule of Law

A strong rule of law helps ensure fair competition in a market-based system and it protects the incentives and efficiency of this system. When a country's legal system can reliably and efficiently enforce agreements that businesses make and protect people's property and investments, the economy can function. If there are strong disagreements, a contract broken, or a bankruptcy, a well-developed legal system makes working these things out fair and orderly. When the government fails to do these things, investing and doing business in a country is a lot riskier and inefficient. A strong rule of law also helps stamp out corruption and other activities that discourage profit seeking and prevent the most highly valued products and businesses from thriving.

We measure rule of law by combining measures related to the efficiency of the legal framework in settling disputes (WEF), property rights (WEF), protecting investors (World Bank/IFC), and enforcing contracts (World Bank/IFC). The pieces of our rule of law indicator are shown in the table below. As with our measures of corruption and bureaucracy, the rule of law tends to be strongly related to a country's income. Again, we won't delve into all the reasons here, but it's intuitive that countries that have less resources and less educated populations have more immature legal systems, and the rule of law is likely compounded by interrelated factors, like higher corruption. Here we want to look at the rule of law of a country taking into account its development stage. That gives us a better sense of the underlying cultural elements that will determine its lawfulness as it develops. It's also a more helpful perspective in looking at future growth. As with our measures of bureaucracy and corruption, we would expect that businessmen and investors will likely expect there to be lower rule of law in poorer countries, and so it may not impact their decision to do business or invest in an emerging country that is otherwise competitive. But if the rule of law is particularly weak in that country relative to others of similar income, that is likely a drag. Indeed, we see no relationship between the rule of law on its own and future growth. But once we exclude the effect of income, our gauge of the rule of law is 57% correlated to historical future growth in income per capita. In other words, when countries still fail to uphold the rule of law once they are rich, their cultures often appear to be holding back their growth. Along with our measures of bureaucracy and corruption, this gauge helps us triangulate the picture of how hard it is to do business in a country.

Before taking into account income levels, Singapore, Japan, and the English-speaking developed world are at the top of our ranking. Despite its wealth and development stage, Italy ranks near the bottom of the list, just ahead of Argentina, [Greece](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/Solutions/PSET%203%20Solution-Financial%20Instruments.md), and Russia. Emerging countries also tend to perform poorly on this measure. Once we exclude the effect of income, Italy and [Greece](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/Solutions/PSET%203%20Solution-Financial%20Instruments.md) stand out as having an especially weak rule of law. In general, the European periphery and Latin American countries rate toward the bottom, with the rest of the developed world and emerging Asian countries toward the top. Singapore stays at the top even after taking out income, along with other rich nations. The US and Japan rate as having a rule of law that is just modestly strong given their levels of income.

#### Summary Observations

On the basis of productivity and indebtedness alone, the countries which have the elements to grow incomes per worker fastest today are India, China, Thailand, Singapore and Korea. Based on these elements, European countries and Japan are expected to grow slowest. While, the different pieces that go into this view are described above, we'll also describe them briefly here. We expect India to grow strongly (6% or so), primarily because of India's low indebtedness and significant cost advantage relative to the rest of the world even accounting for its poor education (its income per capita is just \$1,000, 4x less than China's). While incomes have grown very fast in China and there has been a material leveraging, we still expect fairly strong growth of 5% due to China's strong competitive position. The Chinese labor force remains highly attractive as a result of their work ethic and how educated they are relative to the cost, and they continue to save at a high rate, providing capital that is invested in projects that will improve productivity in the future. China's culture of self -sufficiency and achievement also provides a material support. Of course the policies of these countries can shift these growth rates. Most importantly in China the implementation of reforms and the management of the debt will be important and in India the reforms will be important. In both cases shifts in policies should be reflected in our indices.

This formula projects productivity growth in the US to be around 1.5%-2%, in the middle of the pack globally but ahead of most other rich nations. The US is now one of the more competitive developed world economies, with a well-educated but expensive workforce, despite an increasing [preference](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Utility%20Indices.md) for leisure and very low savings rates. While it is managing its deleveraging beautifully, it remains relatively highly indebted. We expect growth in Germany to be a bit lower than in the US. Germany is expensive relative to the US and central bank (ECB) stimulation has been less aggressive. At the same time, healthy household savings rates, a culture of innovation and commercialism, and good governance are positive supports for Germany's productivity growth. And Germany has not been reliant on credit expansion for its growth, and [monetary policy](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) is relatively stimulative relative to German conditions. On the lowest end we see Japan and the southern European countries, all of which are globally uncompetitive and highly indebted, and have a history of experiencing [monetary policy](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) that is tight relative to conditions. The growth prospects of Italy and Spain, along with France and a number of Latin American countries are also hindered by a culture that values savoring life over achievement or self sufficiency.
