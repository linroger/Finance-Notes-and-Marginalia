# Part 2: Economic Health Indices by Country, and the Prognoses That They Imply

While in Part 1 I showed economic health measures indicator by indicator, in this part I show them country by country. By turning to the countries that you are interested in, you will be able to see all of the influences and what they imply for economic growth over the next 10 years for each of those countries in one simple table. They are shown in the order of projected economic growth rates and can be found by looking at the [[Table of Contents|table of contents]] on the next page.

The projected economic growth rates for each country are shown and attributed to a) the average annual growth rate of the working population and b) the projected average annual change in the output per worker. The projected change in the average annual output per worker is determined two thirds by that country's projected productivity growth and one third by the size of its debt burdens. The determinants of each country's productivity growth are shown in several gauges that reflect each of the drivers (e.g. cost competitiveness, work attitudes, etc.). These are conveyed in tables that show – 1) the deviation of that country's determinant from the world average (shown in standard deviation terms), and 2) the ranking of that country (among the 20 countries shown) for that indicator. In other words, this one simple table will provide you virtually all that you need to know to gauge each country's economic health and its prospects for the next 10 years. By scanning the table and reading the accompanying text, you will be able to see a country's biggest strengths, and biggest weaknesses. The projections do not take into consideration exogenous factors such as the discoveries of natural resources and wars which will influence growth rates and are beyond my ability to forecast.

The table will not provide the thinking or the individual statistics that are behind each of these gauges. Should you wish to see the individual statistics behind these gauges, you can get them in the appendix to this section. Unfortunately, we are not able to share the statistics underlying our indebtedness measures, which are proprietary.

To be clear, these health indicators show where the current conditions will lead, not what is inevitable. If countries change the influences on their health, like individuals who stop smoking and start exercising, they can improve their prognoses. In fact, while we expect the countries that are more efficient (as measured by our gauges) to do better than those that are less efficient, we expect those that remove their impediments to have the biggest improvements to growth – just as China's strong growth over the last couple decades resulted from it ending its closed-door policy.

It should be noted that there was no subjective judgment used in coming up with these numbers, or even in coming up with the text that explains these indicators. Both the numbers and the text were computer generated. As explained in Part 1 my process of converting indicators into health gauge measures and in turn into projections for growth is very straightforward. To help it to be better understood and to provide each person with their own abilities to vary the processes in the ways they prefer, I am willing to make these statistics and processes open to those who are interested so that they can assess the relationships and change the weights in the ways they think are best.

# **India's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that India's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 7.1% to 9.2%. This growth rate is well above the global average, ranked 1 out of 20 major economies, and 1 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like c ommodity or political shocks, or wars). In India's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 5.8% growth rate per worker, which is well above the global average, and a labor force growth rate of 1.3%, which is well above other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect India's productivity to be much better than most major countries (implying a growth rate of 9.4% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be better than other countries (implying a growth rate of 5.2% on its own). As shown below, India's biggest relative strengths are the value its workers provide relative to education levels and its levels of [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]], and its biggest relative problems are its level of bureaucracy and its reliance on credit flows for growth (though compared to other countries it doesn't rate especially poorly on these measures). The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section. Please review this table to understand our comments.

## **More Detail**

As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences which are conveyed in gauges that are made up of a composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying what we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

## *Productivity*

## *I. Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get*

*A country's productivity and competitiveness is mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost and value of employees and b) the levels of [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively inexpensive and that have higher [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] rates grow faster than those that don't.* 

India offers much better than average value, ranked 1 among the countries we measure. Its workers are very inexpensive, even taking into consideration India's low levels of education and very poor quality of education. Further, people in India work very hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works 37 hours per week (2 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are very favorable. Levels of saving and investing are high given India's very low per capita income levels, with [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] at about 14% of GDP (15 out of 20 countries).

## *II. Culture*

*Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.* 

India's culture looks to be a support to growth in coming years because it is ranked 2 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare India to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, India is rated pretty well on this measure, weighing that its workers have a somewhat strong work ethic, its level of government support is neutral (with government outlays at 27% of GDP), and its labor markets are very flexible. India also seems to value achieving a bit more than savoring again, its work ethic is somewhat strong, and surveys suggest that its people value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat strong in India relative to income. We see the country investing heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are high. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, India has average levels of bureaucracy and red tape, very low corruption, and somewhat strong rule of law relative to its income.

#### *Indebtedness*

*Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is* 

*sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment 1928-1937|debt cycle]] and the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of taking on new debt.* 

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth. India's indebtedness position is better than other countries, ranked 1 out of the 20 countries we look at. The country has a moderate amount of room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 135% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was neither supported nor depressed by credit creation, which is neutral for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally a bit stimulative.

# **China**

# **China's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that China's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 5.0%. This growth rate is well above the global average, ranked 2 out of 20 major economies, and 2 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars). In China's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 5.0% growth rate per worker, which is well above the global average, and a labor force growth rate of -0.1%, which is roughly in line with other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect China's productivity to be much better than most major countries (implying a growth rate of 6.3% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be about average compared to other countries (implying a growth rate of 2.5% on its own). As shown below, China's biggest relative strengths are its levels of [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] and the value its workers provide relative to education levels, and its biggest relative problems are its debt and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] levels and its reliance on credit flows for growth. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section.

## **More Detail**

As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences which are conveyed in gauges that are made up of a composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying what we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

#### *Productivity*

#### *I. Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get*

*A country's productivity and competitiveness is mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost and value of employees and b) the levels of [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively inexpensive and that have higher [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] rates grow faster than those that don't.* 

China offers much better than average value, ranked 2 among the countries we measure. Its workers are somewhat inexpensive, even taking into consideration China's low levels of education and about average quality of education. Further, people in China work hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works 35 hours per week (3 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are about average. Levels of saving and investing are high given China's low per capita income levels, with [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] at about 30% of GDP (1 out of 20 countries).

## *II. Culture*

*Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.* 

China's culture looks to be a support to growth in coming years because it is ranked 4 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare China to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, China is rated about average on this measure, weighing that its workers have a roughly average work ethic, its level of government support is low (with government outlays at 24% of GDP), and its labor markets are neither rigid nor flexible. China also seems to value achieving a bit more than savoring - again, its work ethic is roughly average, and surveys suggest that its people value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat strong in China relative to income. We see the country investing very heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are about average. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, China has average levels of bureaucracy and red tape, somewhat low corruption, and somewhat strong rule of law relative to its income.

#### *Indebtedness*

*Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment 1928-1937|debt cycle]] and the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of taking on new debt.* 

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth. China's indebtedness position is about average compared to other countries, ranked 11 out of the 20 countries we look at. The country has little room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 216% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was supported by high credit creation, which is restrictive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally a bit stimulative.

# **Singapore**

# **Singapore's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that Singapore's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 4.2% to 4.8%. This growth rate is somewhat above the global average, ranked 3 out of 20 major economies, and 1 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Singapore's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 3.5% growth rate per worker, which is well above the global average, and a labor force growth rate of 0.7%, which is somewhat above other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Singapore's productivity to be somewhat better than most major countries (implying a growth rate of 3.7% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be better than other countries (implying a growth rate of 4.9% on its own). As shown below, Singapore's biggest relative strengths are its debt and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] levels and its level of bureaucracy, and its biggest relative problems are how hard its people work and its reliance on credit flows for growth. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section. Please review this table to understand our comments.

Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively inexpensive and that have higher [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] rates grow faster than those that don't.* 

Singapore offers around average value, ranked 10 among the countries we measure. Its workers are neither expensive nor inexpensive, taking into consideration Singapore's high levels of education and very good quality of education. Further, people in Singapore don't work especially hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works 35 hours per week (5 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are roughly average given Singapore's high per capita income levels, with [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] at about 25% of GDP (4 out of 20 countries).

## *II. Culture*

*Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.* 

Singapore's culture looks to be a significant support to growth in coming years because it is ranked 1 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Singapore to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Singapore is rated very well on this measure, weighing that its workers have a strong work ethic, its level of government support is very low (with government outlays at 15% of GDP), and its labor markets are very flexible. Singapore also seems to value achieving a bit more than savoring - again, its work ethic is strong, and surveys suggest that its people value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat weak in Singapore relative to income. We see the country investing neither lightly nor heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are low. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, Singapore has very low bureaucracy and red tape, somewhat low corruption, and very strong rule of law relative to its income.

Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally neutral.

# **Mexico**

# **Mexico's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that Mexico's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 4.1% to 5.5%. This growth rate is somewhat above the global average, ranked 4 out of 20 major economies, and 3 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Mexico's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 2.8% growth rate per worker, which is well above the global average, and a labor force growth rate of 1.3%, which is well above other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Mexico's productivity to be somewhat better than most major countries (implying a growth rate of 3.9% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be better than other countries (implying a growth rate of 4.7% on its own). As shown below, Mexico's biggest relative strengths are its debt and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] levels and the value its workers provide relative to education levels, and its biggest relative problems are its reliance on credit flows for growth and its level of innovation/commercialism.

# **Mexico**

## **More Detail**

As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences which are conveyed in gauges that are made up of a composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying what we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

#### *Productivity*

## *I. Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get*

*A country's productivity and competitiveness is mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost and value of employees and b) the levels of [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively inexpensive and that have higher [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] rates grow faster than those that don't.* 

Mexico offers somewhat better than average value, ranked 4 among the countries we measure. Its workers are somewhat inexpensive, even taking into consideration Mexico's somewhat low levels of education and very poor quality of education. Further, people in Mexico work hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works 35 hours per week (4 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are about average. Levels of saving and investing are roughly average given Mexico's low per capita income levels, with [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] at about 14% of GDP (16 out of 20 countries).

## *II. Culture*

*Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.* 

Mexico's culture looks to be neutral for growth in coming years because it is ranked 8 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Mexico to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Mexico is rated very well on this measure, weighing that its workers have a strong work ethic, its level of government support is low (with government outlays at 27% of GDP), and its labor markets are very flexible. Mexico also seems to value achieving a bit more than savoring - again, its work ethic is strong, and surveys suggest that its people moderately value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat weak in Mexico relative to income. We see the country investing lightly in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are low. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, Mexico has somewhat low bureaucracy and red tape, somewhat high corruption, and somewhat weak rule of law relative to its income.

#### *Indebtedness*

*Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment 1928-1937|debt cycle]] and the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of taking on new debt.* 

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth. Mexico's indebtedness position is better than other countries, ranked 3 out of the 20 countries we look at. The country has plenty of room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 84% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was supported by high credit creation, which is restrictive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally neutral.

# **Thailand**

# **Thailand's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that Thailand's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 4.0% to 4.9%. This growth rate is somewhat above the global average, ranked 5 out of 20 major economies, and 4 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Thailand's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 4.2% growth rate per worker, which is somewhat above the global average, and a labor force growth rate of -0.2%, which is somewhat below other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Thailand's productivity to be much better than most major countries (implying a growth rate of 6.4% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be slightly better than other countries (implying a growth rate of 2.7% on its own). As shown below, Thailand's biggest relative strengths are its levels of [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] and how hard its people work, and its biggest relative problems are its reliance on credit flows for growth and its debt and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] levels (though compared to other countries it doesn't rate especially poorly on these measures). The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section. Please review this table to understand our comments.

# **Thailand**

## **More Detail**

As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences which are conveyed in gauges that are made up of a composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying what we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

#### *Productivity*

#### *I. Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get*

*A country's productivity and competitiveness is mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost and value of employees and b) the levels of [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively inexpensive and that have higher [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] rates grow faster than those that don't.* 

Thailand offers much better than average value, ranked 3 among the countries we measure. Its workers are somewhat inexpensive, even taking into consideration Thailand's somewhat low levels of education and poor quality of education. Further, people in Thailand work hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works 40 hours per week (1 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are about average. Levels of saving and investing are somewhat high given Thailand's very low per capita income levels, with [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] at about 19% of GDP (6 out of 20 countries).

## *II. Culture*

*Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.* 

Thailand's culture looks to be a support to growth in coming years because it is ranked 3 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Thailand to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Thailand is rated pretty well on this measure, weighing that its workers have a strong work ethic, its level of government support is neutral (with government outlays at 24% of GDP), and its labor markets are neither rigid nor flexible. Thailand also seems to value achieving a bit more than savoring - again, its work ethic is strong, though surveys suggest that its people don't especially value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat strong in Thailand relative to income. We see the country investing heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are about average. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, Thailand has very low bureaucracy and red tape, somewhat low corruption, and very strong rule of law relative to its income.

#### *Indebtedness*

*Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that*

*you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment 1928-1937|debt cycle]] and the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of taking on new debt.* 

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth. Thailand's indebtedness position is slightly better than other countries, ranked 7 out of the 20 countries we look at. The country has a bit of room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 156% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was supported by high credit creation, which is restrictive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally neutral.

# **Argentina**

# **Argentina's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that Argentina's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 3.3%. This growth rate is somewhat above the global average, ranked 6 out of 20 major economies, and 5 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Argentina's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 2.5% growth rate per worker, which is somewhat above the global average, and a labor force growth rate of 0.8%, which is well above other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Argentina's productivity to be about average compared to most major countries (implying a growth rate of 1.8% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be better than other countries (implying a growth rate of 3.8% on its own). As shown below, Argentina's biggest relative strengths are its debt and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] levels and the value its workers provide relative to education levels, and its biggest relative problems are its level of bureaucracy and its rule of law. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section.

Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively inexpensive and that have higher [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] rates grow faster than those that don't.* 

Argentina offers somewhat better than average value, ranked 6 among the countries we measure. Its workers are somewhat inexpensive, even taking into consideration Argentina's low levels of education and very poor quality of education. Further, people in Argentina work an average amount relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works 29 hours per week (7 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are about average. Levels of saving and investing are roughly average given Argentina's low per capita income levels, with [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] at about 17% of GDP (9 out of 20 countries).

## *II. Culture*

*Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.* 

Argentina's culture looks to be a significant headwind to growth in coming years because it is ranked 17 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Argentina to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Argentina is rated pretty poorly on this measure, weighing that its workers have a somewhat weak work ethic, its level of government support is high (with government outlays at 41% of GDP), and its labor markets are very rigid. Argentina also seems to value savoring a bit more than achieving - again, its work ethic is somewhat weak, and surveys suggest that its people don't value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are about average in Argentina relative to income. We see the country investing heavily in research and innovation, though its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are low. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, Argentina has very high bureaucracy and red tape, very high corruption, and very weak rule of law relative to its income.

The country has plenty of room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 37% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was very depressed by low credit creation, which is very supportive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally neutral.

**Korea** 

# **Korea's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that Korea's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 2.7% to 3.1%. This growth rate is somewhat above the global average, ranked 7 out of 20 major economies, and 6 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Korea's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 3.4% growth rate per worker, which is somewhat above the global average, and a labor force growth rate of -0.3%, which is somewhat below other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Korea's productivity to be somewhat better than most major countries (implying a growth rate of 3.5% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be slightly better than other countries (implying a growth rate of 2.3% on its own). As shown below, Korea's biggest relative strengths are the value its workers provide relative to education levels and its level of innovation/commercialism, and its biggest relative problems are how hard its people work and its [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]]. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section. Please review this table to understand our comments.

# **Korea**

## **More Detail**

As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences which are conveyed in gauges that are made up of a composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying what we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

#### *Productivity*

#### *I. Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get*

*A country's productivity and competitiveness is mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost and value of employees and b) the levels of [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively inexpensive and that have higher [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] rates grow faster than those that don't.* 

Korea offers somewhat better than average value, ranked 7 among the countries we measure. Its workers are somewhat inexpensive, taking into consideration Korea's high levels of education and very good quality of education. Further, people in Korea don't work especially hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works 29 hours per week (8 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are roughly average given Korea's about average per capita income levels, with [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] at about 27% of GDP (2 out of 20 countries).

## *II. Culture*

*Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.* 

Korea's culture looks to be a support to growth in coming years because it is ranked 5 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Korea to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Korea is rated pretty well on this measure, weighing that its workers have a roughly average work ethic, its level of government support is low (with government outlays at 22% of GDP), and its labor markets are moderately flexible. Korea also seems to value savoring about the same as it values achieving - again, its work ethic is roughly average, and surveys suggest that its people moderately value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are very strong in Korea relative to income. We see the country investing very heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are high. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, Korea has somewhat low bureaucracy and red tape, somewhat high corruption, and average rule of law relative to its income.

#### *Indebtedness*

*Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that*

*you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment 1928-1937|debt cycle]] and the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of taking on new debt.* 

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth. Korea's indebtedness position is slightly better than other countries, ranked 8 out of the 20 countries we look at. The country has a bit of room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 277% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was neither supported nor depressed by credit creation, which is neutral for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally neutral.

# **Brazil**

# **Brazil's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that Brazil's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 2.9% to 3.0%. This growth rate is somewhat above the global average, ranked 8 out of 20 major economies, and 7 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Brazil's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 2.1% growth rate per worker, which is somewhat above the global average, and a labor force growth rate of 0.8%, which is well above other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Brazil's productivity to be about average compared to most major countries (implying a growth rate of 2.2% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be about average compared to other countries (implying a growth rate of 2.2% on its own). As shown below, Brazil's biggest relative strengths are the value its workers provide relative to education levels and its debt and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] levels, and its biggest relative problems are its level of bureaucracy and how its people value savoring life versus achieving. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section. Please review this table to understand our comments.

*A country's productivity and competitiveness is mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost and value of employees and b) the levels of [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively inexpensive and that have higher [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] rates grow faster than those that don't.* 

Brazil offers somewhat better than average value, ranked 5 among the countries we measure. Its workers are somewhat inexpensive, even taking into consideration Brazil's low levels of education and very poor quality of education. Further, people in Brazil work an average amount relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works 28 hours per week (9 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are about average. Levels of saving and investing are roughly average given Brazil's low per capita income levels, with [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] at about 15% of GDP (12 out of 20 countries).

## *II. Culture*

*Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.* 

Brazil's culture looks to be a headwind to growth in coming years because it is ranked 14 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Brazil to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Brazil is rated about average on this measure, weighing that its workers have a somewhat weak work ethic, its level of government support is high (with government outlays at 40% of GDP), and its labor markets are moderately flexible. Brazil also seems to value savoring much more than achieving - again, its work ethic is somewhat weak, and surveys suggest that its people don't value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are about average in Brazil relative to income. We see the country investing heavily in research and innovation, though its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are low. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, Brazil has very high bureaucracy and red tape, average levels of corruption, and somewhat weak rule of law relative to its income.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth. Brazil's indebtedness position is about average compared to other countries, ranked 10 out of the 20 countries we look at. The country has a bit of room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 121% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was supported by high credit creation, which is restrictive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally neutral.

# **United States**

# **USA's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that USA's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 1.8% to 2.2%. This growth rate is roughly at the global average, ranked 9 out of 20 major economies, and 2 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computergenerated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars). In USA's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 1.5% growth rate per worker, which is roughly in line with the global average, and a labor force growth rate of 0.2%, which is somewhat above other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect USA's productivity to be about average compared to most major countries (implying a growth rate of 1.5% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be slightly better than other countries (implying a growth rate of 3.0% on its own). As shown below, USA's biggest relative strengths are its [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] and its level of innovation/commercialism, and its biggest relative problems are its debt and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] levels and how hard its people work. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section.

Further, people in USA don't work hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works 24 hours per week (14 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are somewhat low given USA's high per capita income levels, with [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] at about 14% of GDP (14 out of 20 countries).

## *II. Culture*

As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.* 

USA's culture looks to be a support to growth in coming years because it is ranked 6 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare USA to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, USA is rated pretty well on this measure, weighing that its workers have a somewhat weak work ethic, its level of government support is neutral (with government outlays at 40% of GDP), and its labor markets are very flexible. USA also seems to value achieving a bit more than savoring again, its work ethic is somewhat weak, though surveys suggest that its people highly value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat strong in USA relative to income. We see the country investing heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are high. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, USA has somewhat low bureaucracy and red tape, somewhat high corruption, and somewhat strong rule of law relative to its income.

In the past few years, its growth was depressed by low credit creation, which is supportive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally a bit stimulative.

# **United Kingdom**

# **United Kingdom's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that UK's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 1.5% to 1.7%. This growth rate is roughly at the global average, ranked 10 out of 20 major economies, and 3 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computergenerated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars).

As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences which are conveyed in gauges that are made up of a composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying what we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

#### *Productivity*

## *I. Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get*

*A country's productivity and competitiveness is mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost and value of employees and b) the levels of [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively inexpensive and that have higher [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] rates grow faster than those that don't.* 

UK offers somewhat worse than average value, ranked 15 among the countries we measure. Its workers are neither expensive nor inexpensive, taking into consideration UK's about average levels of education and good quality of education. Further, people in UK don't work especially hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works 23 hours per week (15 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are somewhat low given UK's high per capita income levels, with [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] at about 13% of GDP (17 out of 20 countries).

## *II. Culture*

*Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.* 

UK's culture looks to be neutral for growth in coming years because it is ranked 7 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare UK to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, UK is rated pretty poorly on this measure, weighing that its workers have a weak work ethic, its level of government support is high (with government outlays at 45% of GDP), and its labor markets are moderately flexible. UK also seems to value savoring a bit more than achieving - again, its work ethic is weak, and surveys suggest that its people don't especially value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are about average in UK relative to income. We see the country investing heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are about average. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, UK has somewhat low bureaucracy and red tape, somewhat low corruption, and very strong rule of law relative to its income.

#### *Indebtedness*

*Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment 1928-1937|debt cycle]] and the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of taking on new debt.* 

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth. UK's indebtedness position is slightly worse than other countries, ranked 13 out of the 20 countries we look at. The country has very little room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 465% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was depressed by low credit creation, which is supportive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally a bit stimulative.

# **Russia**

# **Russia's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that Russia's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 1.5%. This growth rate is roughly at the global average, ranked 11 out of 20 major economies, and 8 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Russia's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 2.5% growth rate per worker, which is roughly in line with the global average, and a labor force growth rate of -1.0%, which is well below other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Russia's productivity to be about average compared to most major countries (implying a growth rate of 1.8% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be slightly better than other countries (implying a growth rate of 3.7% on its own). As shown below, Russia's biggest relative strengths are its debt and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] levels and the value its workers provide relative to education levels, and its biggest relative problems are how hard its people work and its level of corruption relative to income. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section. Please review this table to understand our comments.

Note that our culture measures compare Russia to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Russia is rated about average on this measure, weighing that its workers have a somewhat weak work ethic, its level of government support is neutral (with government outlays at 38% of GDP), and its labor markets are neither rigid nor flexible. Russia also seems to value savoring a bit more than achieving - again, its work ethic is somewhat weak, and surveys suggest that its people don't especially value accomplishment and achievement.

# **Australia**

# **Australia's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that Australia's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 1.3% to 1.7%. This growth rate is roughly at the global average, ranked 12 out of 20 major economies, and 4 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Australia's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 0.6% growth rate per worker, which is roughly in line with the global average, and a labor force growth rate of 0.7%, which is somewhat above other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Australia's productivity to be somewhat worse than most major countries (implying a growth rate of 0.5% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be slightly worse than other countries (implying a growth rate of 1.8% on its own). As shown below, Australia's biggest relative strengths are its low reliance on credit flows for growth and its level of bureaucracy (though compared to other countries it doesn't rate especially well on these measures), and its biggest relative problems are the value its workers provide relative to education levels and how hard its people work. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section.

Its workers are very expensive, even taking into consideration Australia's somewhat high levels of education and good quality of education. Further, people in Australia don't work especially hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works 27 hours per week (10 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are roughly average given Australia's very high per capita income levels, with [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] at about 26% of GDP (3 out of 20 countries).

## *II. Culture*

*Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.* 

Australia's culture looks to be neutral for growth in coming years because it is ranked 11 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Australia to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Australia is rated about average on this measure, weighing that its workers have a roughly average work ethic, its level of government support is neutral (with government outlays at 37% of GDP), and its labor markets are neither rigid nor flexible. Australia also seems to value savoring about the same as it values achieving - again, its work ethic is roughly average, and surveys suggest that its people value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat weak in Australia relative to income. We see the country investing neither lightly nor heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are low. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, Australia has average levels of bureaucracy and red tape, average levels of corruption, and average rule of law relative to its income.

#### *Indebtedness*

*Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that*

*you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process works in reverse.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth. Australia's indebtedness position is slightly worse than other countries, ranked 16 out of the 20 countries we look at. The country has little room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 300% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was neither supported nor depressed by credit creation, which is neutral for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally neutral.

**Canada** 

# **Canada's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that Canada's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 1.1% to 1.4%. This growth rate is somewhat below the global average, ranked 13 out of 20 major economies, and 5 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Canada's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 0.9% growth rate per worker, which is somewhat below the global average, and a labor force growth rate of 0.2%, which is roughly in line with other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Canada's productivity to be somewhat worse than most major countries (implying a growth rate of 0.6% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be about average compared to other countries (implying a growth rate of 2.4% on its own). As shown below, Canada's biggest relative strengths are its rule of law and its level of corruption relative to income, and its biggest relative problems are how hard its people work and the value its workers provide relative to education levels. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section.

# **Canada**

## **More Detail**

As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences which are conveyed in gauges that are made up of a composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying what we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

#### *Productivity*

#### *I. Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get*

*A country's productivity and competitiveness is mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost and value of employees and b) the levels of [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively inexpensive and that have higher [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] rates grow faster than those that don't.* 

Canada offers somewhat worse than average value, ranked 16 among the countries we measure. Its workers are somewhat expensive, even taking into consideration Canada's somewhat high levels of education and very good quality of education. Further, people in Canada don't work hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works 24 hours per week (13 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are very unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are somewhat low given Canada's high per capita income levels, with [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] at about 18% of GDP (7 out of 20 countries).

## *II. Culture*

*Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.* 

Canada's culture looks to be neutral for growth in coming years because it is ranked 10 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Canada to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Canada is rated about average on this measure, weighing that its workers have a somewhat weak work ethic, its level of government support is neutral (with government outlays at 46% of GDP), and its labor markets are very flexible. Canada also seems to value savoring a bit more than achieving - again, its work ethic is somewhat weak, and surveys suggest that its people moderately value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat weak in Canada relative to income. We see the country investing neither lightly nor heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are low. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, Canada has average levels of bureaucracy and red tape, average levels of corruption, and somewhat strong rule of law relative to its income.

#### *Indebtedness*

*Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that*

*you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment 1928-1937|debt cycle]] and the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of taking on new debt.* 

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth. Canada's indebtedness position is about average compared to other countries, ranked 9 out of the 20 countries we look at. The country has a bit of room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 274% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was neither supported nor depressed by credit creation, which is neutral for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally neutral.

# **Germany**

# **Germany's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that Germany's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 0.1% to 0.8%. This growth rate is somewhat below the global average, ranked 14 out of 20 major economies, and 6 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Germany's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 1.5% growth rate per worker, which is somewhat below the global average, and a labor force growth rate of -0.7%, which is well below other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Germany's productivity to be somewhat worse than most major countries (implying a growth rate of 0.1% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be about average compared to other countries (implying a growth rate of 2.1% on its own). As shown below, Germany's biggest relative strengths are its [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] and its low reliance on credit flows for growth, and its biggest relative problems are its debt and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] levels and how hard its people work. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section. Please review this table to understand our comments.

Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally a bit stimulative.

**France** 

# **France's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that France's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 0.1% to 0.8%. This growth rate is somewhat below the global average, ranked 15 out of 20 major economies, and 7 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars). In France's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 0.8% growth rate per worker, which is somewhat below the global average, and a labor force growth rate of 0.0%, which is roughly in line with other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect France's productivity to be much worse than most major countries (implying a growth rate of -0.8% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be slightly worse than other countries (implying a growth rate of 1.8% on its own). As shown below, France's biggest relative strengths are its [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] and its low reliance on credit flows for growth, and its biggest relative problems are its debt and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] levels and how hard its people work.

## *I. Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get*

*A country's productivity and competitiveness is mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost and value of employees and b) the levels of [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively inexpensive and that have higher [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] rates grow faster than those that don't.* 

France offers somewhat worse than average value, ranked 20 among the countries we measure. Its workers are very expensive, taking into consideration France's somewhat low levels of education and good quality of education. Further, people in France don't work hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works 17 hours per week (20 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are roughly average given France's high per capita income levels, with [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] at about 17% of GDP (8 out of 20 countries).

## *II. Culture*

*Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.* 

France's culture looks to be a headwind to growth in coming years because it is ranked 16 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare France to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, France is rated very poorly on this measure, weighing that its workers have a weak work ethic, its level of government support is very high (with government outlays at 57% of GDP), and its labor markets are neither rigid nor flexible. France also seems to value savoring much more than achieving - again, its work ethic is weak, and surveys suggest that its people don't value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat weak in France relative to income. We see the country investing neither lightly nor heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are very low.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth. France's indebtedness position is slightly worse than other countries, ranked 14 out of the 20 countries we look at. The country has very little room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 320% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was depressed by low credit creation, which is supportive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally a bit stimulative.

# **Hungary**

# **Hungary's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that Hungary's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 0.7% to 0.8%. This growth rate is somewhat below the global average, ranked 16 out of 20 major economies, and 9 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Hungary's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 1.5% growth rate per worker, which is somewhat below the global average, and a labor force growth rate of -0.7%, which is well below other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Hungary's productivity to be about average compared to most major countries (implying a growth rate of 1.7% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be worse than other countries (implying a growth rate of 1.1% on its own). As shown below, Hungary's biggest relative strengths are the value its workers provide relative to education levels and its low reliance on credit flows for growth, and its biggest relative problems are its debt and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] levels and how hard its people work. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section.

As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences which are conveyed in gauges that are made up of a composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying what we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

#### *Productivity*

#### *I. Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get*

*A country's productivity and competitiveness is mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost and value of employees and b) the levels of [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively inexpensive and that have higher [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] rates grow faster than those that don't.* 

Hungary offers around average value, ranked 9 among the countries we measure. Its workers are somewhat inexpensive, taking into consideration Hungary's about average levels of education and poor quality of education. Further, people in Hungary don't work especially hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works 21 hours per week (16 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are roughly average given Hungary's about average per capita income levels, with [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] at about 15% of GDP (11 out of 20 countries).

## *II. Culture*

*Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.* 

Hungary's culture looks to be a headwind to growth in coming years because it is ranked 13 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Hungary to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Hungary is rated pretty poorly on this measure, weighing that its workers have a weak work ethic, its level of government support is very high (with government outlays at 50% of GDP), and its labor markets are very flexible. Hungary also seems to value savoring much more than achieving again, its work ethic is weak, and surveys suggest that its people don't especially value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat weak in Hungary relative to income. We see the country investing neither lightly nor heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are low. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, Hungary has average levels of bureaucracy and red tape, average levels of corruption, and somewhat weak rule of law relative to its income.

#### *Indebtedness*

*Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that*

*you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment 1928-1937|debt cycle]] and the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of taking on new debt.* 

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth. Hungary's indebtedness position is worse than other countries, ranked 18 out of the 20 countries we look at. The country has very little room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 193% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was depressed by low credit creation, which is supportive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally neutral.

# **Spain's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that Spain's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 0.1% to 0.5%. This growth rate is somewhat below the global average, ranked 17 out of 20 major economies, and 8 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Spain's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 0.6% growth rate per worker, which is well below the global average, and a labor force growth rate of -0.1%, which is roughly in line with other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Spain's productivity to be much worse than most major countries (implying a growth rate of -0.4% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be worse than other countries (implying a growth rate of 1.4% on its own). As shown below, Spain's biggest relative strengths are its [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] and its low reliance on credit flows for growth, and its biggest relative problems are its debt and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] levels and how hard its people work. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The

individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section. Please review this table to understand our comments.

Spain's culture looks to be a significant headwind to growth in coming years because it is ranked 18 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Spain to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Spain is rated pretty poorly on this measure, weighing that its workers have a weak work ethic, its level of government support is very high (with government outlays at 46% of GDP), and its labor markets are moderately flexible. Spain also seems to value savoring a bit more than achieving - again, its work ethic is weak, and surveys suggest that its people moderately value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat weak in Spain relative to income. We see the country investing neither lightly nor heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are very low.

In the past few years, its growth was depressed by low credit creation, which is supportive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally neutral.

# **Japan's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that Japan's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of 0.1% to 0.2%. This growth rate is well below the global average, ranked 18 out of 20 major economies, and 9 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computergenerated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like c ommodity or political shocks, or wars). In Japan's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 0.9% growth rate per worker, which is well below the global average, and a labor force growth rate of -0.8%, which is well below other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Japan's productivity to be somewhat worse than most major countries (implying a growth rate of 1.1% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be worse than other countries (implying a growth rate of 0.7% on its own). As shown below, Japan's biggest relative strengths are its [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] and its rule of law, and its biggest relative problems are its debt and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] levels and its aging workforce. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section.

## **More Detail**

As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences which are conveyed in gauges that are made up of a composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying what we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

#### *Productivity*

## *I. Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get*

*A country's productivity and competitiveness is mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost and value of employees and b) the levels of [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively inexpensive and that have higher [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] rates grow faster than those that don't.* 

Japan offers somewhat worse than average value, ranked 13 among the countries we measure. Its workers are somewhat expensive, even taking into consideration Japan's somewhat high levels of education and very good quality of education. Further, people in Japan don't work especially hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works 31 hours per week (6 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are somewhat low given Japan's high per capita income levels, with [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] at about 19% of GDP (5 out of 20 countries).

## *II. Culture*

*Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.* 

Japan's culture looks to be neutral for growth in coming years because it is ranked 9 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Japan to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Japan is rated about average on this measure, weighing that its workers have a somewhat strong work ethic, its level of government support is high (with government outlays at 40% of GDP), and its labor markets are neither rigid nor flexible. Japan also seems to value savoring about the same as it values achieving - again, its work ethic is somewhat strong, though surveys suggest that its people don't especially value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are about average in Japan relative to income. We see the country investing neither lightly nor heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are about average. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, Japan has very high bureaucracy and red tape, average levels of corruption, and somewhat strong rule of law relative to its income.

#### *Indebtedness*

*Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that*

*you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment 1928-1937|debt cycle]] and the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of taking on new debt.* 

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth. Japan's indebtedness position is worse than other countries, ranked 19 out of the 20 countries we look at. The country has very little room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 449% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was supported by high credit creation, which is restrictive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally stimulative.

**Italy** 

# **Italy's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that Italy's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of -0.7% to -0.4%. This growth rate is well below the global average, ranked 19 out of 20 major economies, and 10 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Italy's case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a -0.1% growth rate per worker, which is well below the global average, and a labor force growth rate of -0.3%, which is somewhat below other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Italy's productivity to be much worse than most major countries (implying a growth rate of -1.6% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be slightly worse than other countries (implying a growth rate of 1.7% on its own). As shown below, Italy's biggest relative strengths are its [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] and its low reliance on credit flows for growth (though compared to other countries it doesn't rate especially well on these measures), and its biggest relative problems are its debt and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] levels and how hard its people work. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section.

## **More Detail**

As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences which are conveyed in gauges that are made up of a composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying what we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

#### *Productivity*

## *I. Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get*

*A country's productivity and competitiveness is mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost and value of employees and b) the levels of [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively inexpensive and that have higher [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] rates grow faster than those that don't.* 

Italy offers somewhat worse than average value, ranked 18 among the countries we measure. Its workers are somewhat expensive, taking into consideration Italy's somewhat low levels of education and about average quality of education. Further, people in Italy don't work hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works 20 hours per week (17 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are roughly average given Italy's high per capita income levels, with [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] at about 15% of GDP (13 out of 20 countries).

## *II. Culture*

*Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.* 

Italy's culture looks to be a significant headwind to growth in coming years because it is ranked 20 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Italy to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Italy is rated very poorly on this measure, weighing that its workers have a weak work ethic, its level of government support is very high (with government outlays at 51% of GDP), and its labor markets are very rigid. Italy also seems to value savoring much more than achieving - again, its work ethic is weak, and surveys suggest that its people don't value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are very weak in Italy relative to income. We see the country investing very lightly in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are very low. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, Italy has very high bureaucracy and red tape, very high corruption, and very weak rule of law relative to its income.

#### *Indebtedness*

*Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment 1928-1937|debt cycle]] and the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of taking on new debt.* 

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to future growth. Italy's indebtedness position is slightly worse than other countries, ranked 15 out of the 20 countries we look at. The country has very little room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 341% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was neither supported nor depressed by credit creation, which is neutral for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] is generally a bit stimulative.

# **Greece's Future Growth**

Based on our economic health index, we project that [[PSET 3 Solution-Financial Instruments|Greece]]'s real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the vicinity of -0.4%. This growth rate is well below the global average, ranked 20 out of 20 major economies, and 11 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computergenerated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for [[Some Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes|exogenous shocks]] (like commodity or political shocks, or wars). In [[PSET 3 Solution-Financial Instruments|Greece]]'s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 0.0% growth rate per worker, which is well below the global average, and a labor force growth rate of -0.4%, which is somewhat below other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect [[PSET 3 Solution-Financial Instruments|Greece]]'s productivity to be somewhat worse than most major countries (implying a growth rate of 0.1% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be worse than other countries (implying a growth rate of 0.0% on its own). As shown below, [[PSET 3 Solution-Financial Instruments|Greece]]'s biggest relative strengths are the value its workers provide relative to education levels and its low reliance on credit flows for growth (though compared to other countries it doesn't rate especially well on these measures), and its biggest relative problems are its debt and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] levels and how hard its people work. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section. Please review this table to understand our comments.

[[PSET 3 Solution-Financial Instruments|Greece]] offers around average value, ranked 11 among the countries we measure. Its workers are neither expensive nor inexpensive, taking into consideration [[PSET 3 Solution-Financial Instruments|Greece]]'s somewhat high levels of education and poor quality of education. Further, people in [[PSET 3 Solution-Financial Instruments|Greece]] don't work especially hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works 25 hours per week (12 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are somewhat low given [[PSET 3 Solution-Financial Instruments|Greece]]'s about average per capita income levels, with [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] at about 9% of GDP (20 out of 20 countries).

#### *II. Culture*

# **Appendix: List of Statistics that Make Up Our Gauges**

Below, we share all of the individual indicators that make up our productivity gauges, showing the most recent reading for each country. Countries that score best on the measure appear on the left, and countries that score worst are on the right. For further discussion of these concepts and gauges, see Part 1. Regrettably, we can't share the statistics underlying our proprietary indebtedness gauges.
