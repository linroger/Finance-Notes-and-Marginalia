# Introduction

Are there limits to a country’s’ debt and debt growth?

What will happen to interest rates and all that they affect if government debt growth isn’t slowed?

Can a big, important country that has a major reserve currency like the US go broke—and, if so, what would that look like?

Is there such a thing as a “Big Debt Cycle” that we can track that will tell us when to worry about debt and what to do about it?

These aren’t just academic questions for academic economists. They are questions that investors, policy makers, and most everyone must answer because the answers will have huge effects on all our well-beings and what we should do. But definitive answers don’t currently exist.

At this time, some people believe that there isn't any limit to government debt and debt growth, especially if a country has a reserve currency. That’s because they believe that the central bank of a reserve currency country that has its money widely accepted around the world can always print the money to service its debts. Others believe that the high levels of debt and rapid debt growth are harbingers of a big debt crisis on the horizon, but they do not know exactly how and when the crisis will come—or what its impacts will be.

And what about the big, long-term debt cycle? While the “business cycle” is widely acknowledged and some people recognize that it is driven by a short-term debt cycle, that is not true for the big, long-term debt cycle. Nobody acknowledges it or talks about it. I couldn’t find any good studies or descriptions of it in textbooks, and even the world’s leading economists—including those who are now running, or in the past ran, central banks and government Treasuries—didn’t have much to say about this critically important subject when I explored it with them. That is why I did this study and am passing it along.

Before I get into all that, I should begin by explaining where I’m coming from. I don’t come to this subject as an economist. I come as a global macro investor who for over 50 years has been through many debt cycles in many countries and has had to navigate and understand them well enough to bet on how they would go. I have carefully studied all the big debt cycles over the last 100 years, and superficially studied many more from the past 500 years, so I believe that I understand how to navigate them. Because I am now deeply concerned, I feel a responsibility to pass along this study for others to assess for themselves.

To gain my understanding, I look at many cases like a doctor studies many cases, examining the mechanics behind them to understand the cause/effect relationships that drive their progressions. I also learn from being in these experiences, reflecting on what I learn, writing it up, and having smart people read and challenge it. Then I build systems to place my bets on what I learned and have new experiences. I do that over and over and will do it until I die because I love it. Because my game has been to bet on the markets and because the debt markets drive just about everything, I have been obsessed with studying debt dynamics for decades. I believe that if you understand these dynamics, you can do very well as an investor, businessperson, or policy maker, and if you don’t, you ultimately will be hurt by them.

Through my research, I discovered that there are big, long-term debt cycles that have unfailingly led to big debt bubbles and busts. I saw that only about $20 \%$ of the roughly 750 currency/debt markets that have existed since 1700 remain and that all these remaining ones have been severely devalued through the mechanistic process I am going to describe in this study. I saw how this big, long-term debt cycle was described in the Old Testament, how it repeatedly played out in Chinese dynasties over thousands of years, and how time and again it has foreshadowed the fall of empires, countries, and provinces.

These Big Debt Cycles have always worked in timeless and universally consistent ways that are not well understood but should be. In this study, I hope to explain how they work with such clarity that my description will serve as a template that can be used to see what is going on with, and what is likely to happen to, money and debt. While I recognize that the Big Debt Cycle template I will describe has not previously been vetted, I am confident it exists because I have made a lot of money using it to bet on how things would go. I am passing it along because I am now at a stage of life in which I want to share what I have learned that I have found of value. You can do what you like with it.

Why do I think I understand something that others don’t? I theorize that this is for a few reasons. First, this dynamic is not widely understood because big, long-term debt cycles typically last about one lifetime—roughly 80 years (give or take 25 years)—so we don’t get to learn about them through experience. Second, because we focus so much on what is happening to us at the time it is happening, people overlook the big picture. I also think there are biases against being concerned about too much debt because most people like the spending ability that credit gives them, and it is also true that there have been many warnings about pending debt crises that never happened. Memories of big debt crises like the 2008 global financial crisis and the European debt crisis of the PIIGS countries (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain) have faded, and since we have gotten past them, many people assume that policy makers learned how to manage them rather than view these cases as early warnings of bigger crises on the horizon. But whatever the reason, it doesn’t matter exactly why these dynamics are overlooked. I am going to paint a picture of what happens and why, and if there is enough interest in what I’m saying, my template will be assessed and will live or die on its merits.

That leads me to a principle:

If we don’t agree on how things work, we won’t be able to agree on what’s happening or what is likely to happen. For that reason, I need to lay out my picture of how the machine works and try to triangulate with you and other knowledgeable people about it before moving on to look at what’s happening and what might happen.

At a time when government debt is large and increasing rapidly, it seems to me dangerously negligent to assume that this time will be different from other times without first studying how other cases transpired. It would be like assuming that we will never have a civil war or world war again because they haven’t happened before in our lifetimes without studying the mechanics that brought them about in the past. (By the way, I believe that both the civil war and world war dynamics are also going on today.) As in my other books,1 I will create a description of the archetypical dynamic and then look at how and why different cases transpired differently so that one can track current cases relative to the template and put into context what’s happening and what’s likely to happen. In that way, you will both see many cases of this happening and get a peek into the future. Comparing what is happening with that template leads me to believe that we are heading into one of those cases in which central governments and central banks will “go broke” in the ways that have happened hundreds of times before and have had big political and geopolitical consequences.

This brings me to an important point. The Big Debt Cycle is just one of several interrelated forces that together make up what I call the overall Big Cycle. For example, 1) Big Debt Cycles influence and are affected by largely coinciding 2) big cycles of political and social harmony and conflict within countries that are both affected by and affect 3) big cycles of geopolitical harmony and conflict between countries. These cycles in turn are affected by both 4) big acts of nature, like droughts, floods, and pandemics and 5) developments of big new technologies. Combined, these five forces make up the overall Big Cycle of peace and prosperity and conflict and depression. Because these forces affect each other and practically everything, they must be thought of together. How these forces have worked and interacted and are working and interacting now is covered in much greater detail in my book and video titled Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order and to a lesser extent in Chapter 17 of this study, which is the concluding chapter. In this study, I will be mostly focusing on the Big Debt Cycle, though we will see many references to the ways in which the Big Debt Cycle interacts with the other forces to create the path that we are on.

This study consists of four parts and 17 chapters. Part 1 describes the Big Debt Cycle, at first very simply, then in a more complete and mechanical way, and then with some equations that show the mechanics and help with making projections of what is likely to happen. Part 2 shows what has actually happened across 35 Big Debt Cycle cases, laying out in a detailed template the typical sequence of events that signifies how a cycle is transpiring and shows symptoms that can help identify how far the cycle has progressed. Part 3 reviews the most recent Big Debt Cycle, which started when the new monetary and world orders began in 1944 at the end of World War II and brings it up to the present. In that part, in addition to looking at the Big Debt Cycle and the overall Big Cycle with a focus on the US (because it has been the world’s major reserve currency country and the world’s leading power, thus making it the world’s leading shaper of what one might call the American world order since 1944), I also very briefly describe the Big Cycles of both China and Japan, showing them from the 1860s until now. This will give you a more complete picture of what has happened in the world since 1944 and provide two other Big Debt Cycle cases to look at. Finally, in Part 4, I will peek into the future, looking at what my calculations say about what is required for the US to manage its debt burden, and how the five big forces might unfold in the years ahead.

Because I recognize that there are different readers who have different levels of expertise and want to give different amounts of time to this and I want to help you get what you want out of this, I put the most important points in bold so you can read just the most essential stuff and optionally dive into the details that interest you. Also, I put what I believe are timeless and universal principles in bold maroon. If you are a professional or aspiring professional who is really into economics and markets, I recommend that you read the whole thing because I believe that it will give you a unique perspective that you will enjoy and will help you to be successful in your job. If you are not, I recommend that you just read what is in bold. Also, because I’d love to have a two-way conversation with you to try to get in sync about what’s true and what to do about it, I am working on a few new technologies for doing that, which I will tell you about later.

In the next chapter, I will describe the Big Debt Cycle in just seven pages. If you want to stop there, that’s perfectly fine.

I hope that you will find the study’s analysis helpful.

# Part 1: Overview of the Big Debt Cycle

# Chapter 1: The Big Debt Cycle in a Tiny Nutshell

My goal for this chapter is to convey in seven pages a very brief but complete description of the mechanics of a typical Big Debt Cycle.

# How the Machine Works

Credit is the primary vehicle for funding spending and it can easily be created.2 Because one person’s spending is another’s earnings, when there is a lot of credit creation, people spend and earn more, most asset prices go up, and most everyone loves it. Paying back debt is much less enjoyable. As a result, central governments and central banks have a bias toward creating a lot of credit. Credit also creates debt that has to be paid back, which has the opposite effect—i.e., when debts have to be paid back, it creates less spending, lower incomes, and lower asset prices, which people don’t like. In other words, when someone (a borrower-debtor) borrows money (called principal) at a cost (an interest rate), the borrower-debtor can spend more money than they have in earnings and savings over the near term. But over the long term, this requires them to pay back (the principal $^ +$ interest) and when they have to pay it back, it requires them to spend less money than they have. This dynamic is why the credit/spending/debt-paying-back dynamic is inherently cyclical.

# The Short-Term Debt Cycle

Everyone who has been around long enough to be affected by it several times should be well-acquainted with the short-term debt cycle. It starts with money and credit being provided readily when economic activity and inflation are lower than desired, and when interest rates are low relative to inflation rates and low in relation to the rates of return on other investments. Those conditions encourage borrowing to spend and invest, which causes asset prices, economic activity, and inflation to pick up until they are higher than desired, at which time money and credit are restrained, and interest rates become relatively high in relation to inflation rates and rates of return on other investments. This leads to less borrowing to spend and invest, which leads to lower asset prices, a slowing of economic activity, and lower inflation, which leads interest rates to come down, money and credit to become easier, and the cycle to begin again. These cycles have typically lasted about six years, give or take three years.

# Short-Term Debt Cycles Add up to Big, Long-Term Debt Cycles

What isn’t paid enough attention is the way in which these short-term debt cycles add up to big, long-term debt cycles. Because credit is a stimulant that creates a high, people want more of it, so there is a bias toward creating it. This leads debt to rise over time, which typically leads to most of the short-term cyclical highs and lows in debt to be higher than the ones before. These add up to create the long-term debt cycle, which ends when it becomes unsustainable. The capacity to take on more debt is different early in the Big Debt Cycle when debt burdens are lower and there is more potential for credit/debt to be able to fund highly profitable endeavors than it is later in the cycle when debt burdens are higher, and lenders have fewer productive options.

In that early part, it is easy to borrow—even to borrow a lot—and pay it back. These early short-term cycles are primarily driven by the previously described availability and economics of borrowing and spending, and also a lingering cautiousness brought about by memories of the pain of the most recent time when money was tight.3 Early in the Big Debt Cycle, when debts and total debt service are relatively low in relation to incomes and other assets, increases and decreases in credit, spending, debt, and debt service are primarily determined by the previously described incentives with less risk. But late in the Big Debt Cycle, when debts and debt service costs get high relative to income and the value of other assets that can be used to meet one’s debt service obligations, the risks of default are higher. Also, late in the Big Debt Cycle, when there are a lot of debt assets and liabilities relative to income, the balancing act of trying to keep interest rates high enough to satisfy lender-creditors without having them too high for borrower-debtors becomes more challenging. That’s because one person’s debts are another’s assets and both must be satisfied. So, while short-term debt cycles end because of the previously described economic considerations, long-term debt cycles end because the debt burdens are too great to be sustained. Said differently, because it is more enjoyable to borrow and spend, if one isn’t careful, debt and debt service can grow like a cancer, eating up one’s buying power and squeezing out other consumption. This is what makes the long-term Big Debt Cycle.

Throughout the millennia and across countries, what has driven the Big Debt Cycle and has created the big market and economic problems that go along with it is the creation of unsustainably large amounts of debt assets and debt liabilities relative to the amounts of money, goods, services, and investment assets in existence.

Said more simply, a debt is a promise to deliver money. A debt crisis occurs when there have been more promises made than there is money to deliver on them. When that happens, the central bank is forced to choose between a) printing a lot of money and devaluing it or b) not printing a lot of money and having a big debt default crisis. In the end, they always print and devalue. Either way—via default or devaluation—the creation of too much debt eventually causes debt assets (e.g., bonds) to be worth less.

While there are variations in how each of these cases plays out, the most important factor is whether the debt is denominated in a currency that the central bank can “print”. But no matter the variation we almost always see that it becomes relatively undesirable to hold the debt assets (i.e., bonds) relative to holding the productive capacity of the economy (i.e., equities) and/or owning other, more stable forms of money (e.g., gold).

To me it is interesting and inappropriate that, when credit rating agencies rate the credit of a central government, they don’t rate the riskiness of its debt losing value. They only rate the risk of default on the debt, which gives the misimpression that all higher-rated debt is a safe storehold of value. Said differently, because central banks can bail out central governments, the riskiness of central governments’ debts are hidden. Creditors would be better served if the rating agencies rated the riskiness of the debt losing value through both default and devaluation. After all, these bonds are supposed to be storeholds of wealth and should be rated as such. As you will see in this study, that is how I look at bonds. For countries with debts denominated in their own currencies (i.e., in a currency they can print), I rate central governments’ debts separately from their central banks to show how risky they are, and I rate the risks of central banks’ debts by considering the risk of the devaluation of money to be as, if not more, probable than a default on government debt.

Default or devaluation, I don’t care. What I care about is losing my storehold of wealth, which inevitably will happen one way or another.

# Following the Debt Cycle’s Progression

The main difference between a short-term debt cycle and a long-term (big) debt cycle has to do with the central bank’s ability to turn them around. For the short-term debt cycle, its contraction phase can be reversed with a heavy dose of money and credit that brings the economy up from a depressed disinflationary state because the economy has the capacity to produce another phase of noninflationary growth. But the long-term debt cycle’s contraction phase cannot be reversed by producing more money and credit because existing levels of debt growth and debt assets are unsustainable and holders of debt assets want to get out of them because they believe that, one way or another, they will be poor storeholds of wealth.

Think of the Big Debt Cycle’s progression like the progression of a disease or a life cycle through stages that exhibit different symptoms. By identifying these symptoms one can identify approximately where the cycle is in its progression with some expectations of how it is likely to progress from there. Described most simply, the Big Debt Cycle moves from sound/hard money and credit to increasingly loose money and credit to a debt bust that leads to a return to sound/hard money and credit brought about by necessity. More specifically, at first there is heathy borrowing by the private sector that can be paid back; then the private sector overborrows, has losses, and has problems paying it back; then the government sector tries to help, overborrows, has losses, and has problems paying it back; then the central bank tries to help by “printing money” and buying the government debt, and has problems paying it back, which leads it to monetize a lot more debt if it can (i.e., if the debt is denominated in the currency hat it can print). Though not all cases progress in exactly the same way, most cases progress through the following ive stages:

1) The Sound Money Stage: When net debt levels are low, money is sound, the country is competitive, and debt growth fuels productivity growth, which creates incomes that are more than enough to pay back the debts. This leads to increases in financial wealth and confidence. Credit is the promise to deliver money. Unlike credit which requires a payment of money at a later date, money settles transactions—i.e., if money is given the transaction is complete, whereas if credit is given money is owed. It’s easy to create credit. Anyone can create credit but not anyone can create money. For example, I can create credit by accepting your promise to pay me money even if you don’t have the money. As a result, credit easily grows so there is much more credit than there is money. The most effective money is both a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth that is widely accepted around the world. At the early stage of the Big Debt Cycle money is “hard,” which means that it is a medium of exchange that is also a storehold of wealth that can’t easily be increased in supply, such as gold, sterling silver, and Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is now emerging as an accepted hard currency because it is a currency that is widely accepted around the world and is limited in supply. The biggest, most common risk to money becoming an ineffective storehold of wealth is the risk that a lot of it will be created. Imagine having the ability to create money; who wouldn’t be tempted to do a lot of that? Those who can always are. That creates the Big Debt Cycle. In the early part of the Big Debt Cycle, a) money is typically hard—e.g., gold— and the paper money that circulates like money is convertible into the “hard money” at a fixed price and b) there isn’t a lot of paper money and debt (which is the promise to pay money) outstanding. The Big Debt Cycle consists of the building up of a) “paper money” and debt assets/liabilities relative to b) “hard money” and real assets (e.g., goods and services) and relative to the income that is required to service the debt. Basically, the Big Debt Cycle works like a Ponzi scheme or musical chairs with investors holding an increasing amount of debt assets in the belief that they can convert them into money that will have buying power to get real things, yet as the amount of the debt assets that are held up by that faith increases relative to the real things, that conversion becomes more obviously impossible until that is realized and the process of selling the debt to get the hard money and real assets begins. At the early stage of the debt cycle, private and government debt and debt service ratios are 1) low relative to incomes and/or 2) low relative to liquid assets. For example, government debt and debt service are low relative to government tax revenue and/or low relative to government liquid assets (e.g., reserves and other savings such as sovereign wealth assets) that can easily be converted into money. For example, when the Big Debt Cycle that we are in began in 1944, the ratios of a) US government debt and b) US money supply divided by the amount of gold the US government had were equal to a) 7x and b) 1.3x respectively, whereas now these ratios are a) $3 7 \times$ and b) 6x respectively. During this early stage in the cycle, debt levels, debt growth, economic growth, and inflation are neither too hot nor too cold and finances are both sound. At this stage in the cycle, “risky assets” are relatively inexpensive relative to “safe” assets. That is because the memories of the prior period in which there was great damage done affects psychology and pricing. For example, in the late 1940s and early 1950s stock earning’s yields were roughly 4x that of bond yields. During this stage, there is a healthy economy and good investment returns that lead to the next stage. The Debt Bubble Stage: When debt and investment growth are greater than can be serviced from the incomes being produced. In this stage, money is readily available and cheap, there is a debt-financed economic expansion and an economic boom. Demands for and prices of goods, services, and investment assets are driven up by a lot of debt-financed buying, sentiment is very bullish, and, by most conventional measures, the market is overpriced.

In this stage, there are typically amazing new inventions that are truly transformative that investors invest in without an ability or care to assess whether the present value of their future cash flows will be greater or less than their costs.

This dynamic eventually produces a bubble that is reflected in the rates of debt and debt service growth to finance speculation being greater than the income growth rates that are needed to service the debts. In this stage, markets and economies seem great, most everyone believes that they will get better, they are financed by a lot of borrowing, and “wealth” is created out of nothing. By wealth being created out of nothing, I mean that there is greater imagined wealth rather than actual existing wealth. For example, bubble periods are identifiable by extensive periods (e.g., three years) of debt growth that is significantly faster than income growth, high asset prices relative to traditional measures of the present values of likely future cash flows, and many other factors that I measure in my bubble indicator. (You can find the indicator here.) A contemporary example is the unicorn that is valued at over $\$ 1$ billion that has made the owner a “billionaire” on paper but has only raised $\$ 50$ million in capital because speculative venture capitalists put in the money to get option-like chips in case it does well. Bubbles can go on a while before the top is made. However, they inevitably lead to the next stage.

# 3) The Top Stage: When the bubble pops and there is a credit/debt/market/economic contraction.

The popping of the bubble occurs due to a combination of a tightening of money and the prior rate of debt growth being unsustainable. It is just that simple.

When the bubble is popped, a self-reinforcing contraction begins so the debt problems spread very quickly, like an aggressive cancer, so it is very important for policy makers to deal with it quickly, either to reverse it or to guide the deleveraging to its conclusion. In most cases, the debt contraction can be temporarily reversed by giving the system a heavy dose of what caused the debt problem—i.e., by creating more credit and debt. That continues until it can’t continue anymore, at which time a big deleveraging occurs.

# 4) The Deleveraging Stage: When there is a painful bringing down of debt and debt service levels to be in line with income levels so that the debt levels are sustainable.

At the beginning of this stage in the Big Debt Cycle, the first cracks typically spread from the private sector to the central government and then to the central bank. Net selling of debt assets, especially net selling of government debt assets, is a big red flag. When that happens conditions will deteriorate quickly unless managed very well and very quickly by central governments and central banks. That selling takes the form of runs on banks. By “runs on banks” I mean the turning in of debt assets to get real money, which lenders like banks don’t have enough of. When debt problems become apparent, the holders of the debt assets sell their debt assets, which drives interest rates on the debt up. This makes the debt more difficult to service, hence more risky, which drives interest rates higher.

The selling of the government’s debt leads to a) a free-market-driven tightening of money and credit, which leads to b) a weakening of the economy, c) downward pressure on the currency, and d) declining reserves as the central bank attempts to defend the currency. Classically, these runs accelerate and feed on themselves as holders of debt assets see that, one way or another (through default or through the devaluation of their money), they will lose the buying power that they had believed was stored in these debt assets, causing great shifts in market values and wealth until debts are defaulted on, restructured, and/or monetized. Because this tightening proves too harmful for the economy, the central bank eventually simultaneously eases credit and allows a devaluation of the currency. The devaluation of money can itself be the reason to sell the debt asset because it becomes a poor storehold of wealth. So, whether there is a tightening of money that leads to debt defaults and a bad economy or an easing of money that produces a devaluation of money and debt assets, it is not good for the debt asset. This dynamic creates what is called a death spiral because it is a self-reinforcing, debt-contraction dynamic in which the rising interest rates cause problems that creditors see, leading them to sell the debt assets, which leads to even higher interest rates or the need to print more money, which devalues the money and leads to even more selling of the debt assets and the currency and so on until the spiral runs its course. When this happens to government debt, the realization that too much debt is the problem naturally leads to the inclination to cut spending and borrowing. However, because one person’s spending is another’s income, cutting spending at such times typically only contributes to increases in debt-to-income ratios. That is typically when policies are shifted to a mix of debt restructurings and debt monetizations with the mix chosen primarily dependent on how much of the debt is denominated in the country’s currency. This defaulting on, restructuring of, and/or monetizing debt reduces the debt burdens relative to incomes until a new equilibrium is reached. The movement to a stable equilibrium typically takes place via a few painful adjustment spasms because borderline financial soundness is achieved before secure financial soundness.

Classically, the deleveraging process progresses as follows. Early in this recession/depression phase, central banks bring interest rates down and make credit more available. However, when a) debts are large and a debt contraction is underway, b) interest rates can’t be lowered any more (i.e., when they fall around $0 \%$ ), c) there is not enough demand for government debt, and d) the monetary easing is not enough to offset the self-reinforcing depressionary pressures, the central bank is forced to switch to new “tools” to stimulate the economy. Classically, to stimulate the economy the central bank must lower interest rates to below nominal economic growth rates, inflation rates, and bond rates, but that is difficult to do when they approach $0 \%$ . At the same time, the central government is typically getting itself into a lot more debt because tax revenues are down and spending is up to support the private sector, yet there is not enough private sector demand to buy that debt. The central government experiences a debt squeeze in which the free-market demand for its debt falls short of the supply of it. If there is net selling of the debt, that creates a much worse problem.

Often in this deleveraging stage of the cycle there is a “pushing on a string,” a phrase coined by policy makers in the 1930s. It occurs late in the long-term debt cycle when central bankers struggle to convert their stimulative policies into increased spending because savers, investors, and businesses fear borrowing and spending and/or there is deflation, so the risk-free interest that they are getting is relatively attractive to them. At such times, it is difficult to get people to stop saving in “cash” even when interest rates go to $0 \%$ (or even below $0 \%$ ). This phase is characterized by the economy entering a deflationary, weak, or negative growth period as people and investors hoard low-risk, typically government-guaranteed cash.

At this stage, central banks must choose between keeping money “hard,” which will lead debtors to default on their debts, which will lead to deflationary depressions, or making money “soft” by printing a lot of it, which will devalue both it and the debt. Because paying off debt with hard money causes such severe market and economic downturns, when faced with this choice central banks always eventually choose to print and devalue money. Of course, each country’s central bank can only print that country’s money, which brings me to my next big point.

At this stage, if it has the ability to “print money,” the central bank creates a substantial amount of money and credit and throws it aggressively at the markets. It typically buys government debt and private sector debt of systemically important entities that are at risk of defaulting (in order to make up for the private sector’s inadequate demand for debt and to keep interest rates artificially low), and it sometimes buys equities and creates incentives for people to buy goods, services, and financial assets. At this stage, it is also typically desirable to devalue the currency because that is stimulative to the economy and raises

inflation rates thus negating the deflationary pressures. If the currency is linked to gold, silver, or something else, that link is typically broken and there is a move to a fiat monetary system. If the currency isn’t linked—i.e., if the currency is already a fiat currency—devaluing it relative to other storeholds of wealth and other currencies is helpful. In some cases, the central bank’s moves can drive nominal interest rates higher, either because the central bank tightens monetary policy to fight inflation or because it doesn’t tighten money to fight inflation and holders of the debt don’t want to buy the newly issued government debt and/or they want to sell it because it doesn’t provide an adequate return. It is important to watch real and nominal interest rates and the supply and demand for debt to understand what is happening. At such times, extraordinary policies to get money like imposing extraordinary taxes and capital controls become common.

This deleveraging stage is typically a painful time when debt burdens are reduced by defaults, restructurings, and/or devaluations. This is when an aggressive mix of debt restructurings and debt monetizations inevitably takes place to reduce the debt and debt service burdens relative to incomes. In a typical deleveraging the debt-to-income ratio has the be lowered by roughly $50 \%$ , give or take about $20 \%$ . It can be done well or poorly. When it is done well, which I call a “beautiful deleveraging,” central governments and central banks simultaneously do both debt restructurings and monetary stimulations in a balanced way. The restructurings reduce debt burdens and are deflationary while the monetary stimulations also reduce debt burdens (by providing money and credit to make it easier to buy debt) but are inflationary and stimulative to the economy so, if they get the balance right, positive growth occurs with falling debt burdens and acceptable inflation. Whether done well or poorly, this is the stage of the Big Debt Cycle that reduces a lot of the debt burden and establishes the bottom that can be built on to begin the next Big Debt Cycle.

5) The Big Debt Crisis Recedes: When a new equilibrium is reached, and a new cycle begins.

In order to have a viable money/credit/debt system, it is imperative that a) money/debt is sound enough to be a viable storehold of wealth, b) debt and debt service burdens are in line with the incomes to service them so that debt growth is sustainable, c) creditors and debtors both believe that those things will exist, and d) the availability of money and credit and real interest rates begin to fall in line with that which is needed by both lender-creditors and borrower-debtors. This late phase of the Big Cycle is when there is a movement to those things happening. It requires both psychological and fundamental adjustments. After a big deleveraging, it is typically difficult to convince lender-creditors to lend because the devaluations/restructurings they experienced in the deleveraging make them risk-averse, so it is imperative that the central government and the central bank take credibility-restoring actions. These generally involve bringing their finances in order by a) the central government earning more money than it spends and/or b) the central bank making money hard again by offering high real yields, raising reserves, and/or linking the currency to something hard like gold or a strong currency. Typically, in this stage, interest rates need to be relatively high in relation to inflation rates and more than high enough to compensate for currency weakness, so it pays to be a lender and is costly to be a borrower. This stage of the cycle can be very attractive for lender-creditors.

The stage that the Big Debt Cycle is in is also reflected in the types of monetary policies being used. As the Big Debt Cycle progresses, central banks have to change how they run monetary policy in order to keep the credit/debt/economic expansion going, so by observing what type of monetary policy they are using, one can surmise about what stage the Big Debt Cycle is in. The phases in monetary policy and the conditions that lead to them are as follows:4

Phase 1: A Linked (i.e., Hard) Monetary System (MP1). This is the type of monetary policy that existed from 1944 until 1971. This type of monetary policy ends when the debt bubble bursts, and there is the previously described “run on the bank” dynamic, which is a run from credit assets to the hard money, and the limited amount of hard money causes massive defaults. This creates a compelling desire to print money rather than leave the supply of it limited by the supply of the gold or hard money that exists to be exchanged at the promised price.

Phase 2: A Fiat Money, Interest-Rate-Driven Monetary Policy (MP2). During this phase, interest rates, bank reserves, and capital requirements are also controllers of the amounts of credit/debt growth. This fiat monetary policy phase both allows more flexibility and provides less assurance that money printing won’t be so large that it will devalue money and debt assets. The US was in this phase from 1971 until 2008. It ends when interest rate changes no longer work (e.g., interest rates hit $0 \%$ and there is a need to ease monetary policy) and/or the private market demand for the debt being created falls short of the supply being sold so that, if the central bank did not print the money and buy the debt, money and credit would be tighter and interest rates would be higher than desired.

Phase 3: A Fiat Monetary System with Debt Monetization (MP3). This type of monetary policy is implemented by the central bank using its ability to create money and credit to buy investment assets. It is the go-to alternative when interest rates can no longer be lowered and when private market demand for debt assets (mostly bonds and mortgages though it can also include other financial assets like equities) is not large enough to buy the supply at an acceptable interest rate. It is good for financial asset prices, so it tends to benefit disproportionally those who have financial assets. It won’t effectively deliver money into the hands of those who are financially most stressed, and it won’t be very targeted. The US was in this phase from 2008 until 2020.

Phase 4: A Fiat Money System with Coordinated Big Fiscal Deficit and Big Debt Monetization Policy (MP4). This type of monetary policy is used when, in order to make the system work well, central government fiscal policy and central bank monetary policy have to be coordinated in order to get money and credit into the hands of people and entities that need it most. While creating money and credit typically temporarily alleviates the debt problem, it does not rectify the problem.

Phase 5: A Big Deleveraging (MP5). This is when there must be a big reduction in debt and debt service payments through a debt restructuring and/or a debt monetization. When managed in the best possible way—what I call a beautiful deleveraging—the deflationary ways of reducing debt burdens (e.g., through debt restructurings) are balanced with the inflationary ways of reducing debt burdens (e.g., by monetizing them), so that the deleveraging occurs without having unacceptable amounts of either deflation or inflation. The Big Debt Cycle sequence to keep in mind is: first the private sector overborrows, has losses, and has problems paying it back (i.e., a debt crisis); then, to help, the government overborrows, has losses, and has problems paying it back; then, to help out, the central bank buys the government debt and takes losses. To fund those purchases and to fund other debtors in trouble (because it is the “lender of last resort”), the central bank prints a lot of money and buys a lot of debt. Then, at its worst, the central bank loses a lot of money on the debt it bought.

o While it is said that modern central bank “prints” money to buy the debt, the central bank doesn’t literally “print money.” Instead, it borrows money (reserves) from commercial banks that it pays a very short-term interest rate on. At its most extreme, the central bank can lose money because the interest earnings it gets on the debt it bought are less than the interest that it has to pay out on the money it borrowed, so when these amounts become large it can find itself in a selfreinforcing spiral of having to buy debt, which leads it to have losses and negative cash flows which leads it to need to print more money to service its debt and to need to buy more debt which ends up having more losses which requires it to do more of the same. This is the “death spiral” I mentioned earlier. When done in large amounts, the “printing” devalues the money and creates inflationary recessions or depressions. If interest rates rise, the central bank loses money on its bond holdings because the interest rate that it has to pay on its liabilities is greater than the interest rate it receives on the debt assets it bought. This is notable but not a big red flag until the central bank has a very large negative net worth and is forced to “print” more money to cover the negative cash flow that it experiences due to less money coming in on its assets than has to go out to service its liabilities. That is what I mean when I say the central bank goes broke: while the central bank doesn’t default on its debts, it can’t make its debt service payments without printing money.

o Eventually the debt restructurings and debt monetizations reduce the size of the debts relative to incomes and the debt cycle runs its course.

Phase 6: The Return to Hard Money (MP6). In this phase the central government takes actions to restore the soundness of its money and credit/debt. This type of monetary policy occurs after the debt has been written down through debt defaults/restructurings and debt monetizations so the debt levels relative to the incomes and amounts of money that are available to service the debts can be brought back into alignment. As previously described, it comes after those who held the debt assets were burned by the defaults and/or inflationary periods, so confidence in holding debt assets has to be rebuilt. At this stage, countries typically go back to MP1 (i.e., a hard-asset-backing monetary policy) or MP2 (an interest rate/money supply-targeted monetary policy) that is beneficial to lender-creditors via high real interest rates.

For great countries with great empires, the end of the Big Debt Cycle has meant the end of their prominence.

# A Few Concluding Observations

It pays to build up savings in the good times so there are savings to draw on in the bad times. There are costs to having too much savings as well as too little savings, and no one gets the balance exactly right.

Big debt crises are inevitable. Throughout history only a very few well-disciplined countries have avoided them. That is because lending is never done perfectly relative to the incomes that are needed to service it. And it is often done badly because people always want more credit and that turns into debt. Debt levels get beyond that which is sustainable which leads to the need to bring the debt burdens down which typically leads to a mixture of debt defaults/restructurings and the creating of money and credit, leading a debt crisis to occur. And people’s psychology reinforces the cycle: the bubble period makes people more optimistic causing them to borrow more, and the bust causes people to be more pessimistic causing them to cut spending. Even though this progression has happened many times in history, most policy makers and investors think their current circumstances and monetary system won’t change. The change is unthinkable—and then it happens suddenly.

The best way to anticipate a debt crisis happening is not by focusing on a single influence or number like debt as a percent of GDP; it is by understanding and focusing on a number of interrelated dynamics that we will get into, especially in the next two chapters.

If debts are denominated in a country’s own currency, its central bank can and will “print” the money to alleviate the debt crisis. This allows them to manage it better than if they couldn’t print the money, but of course it also reduces the value of the money. If the debt is not denominated in currencies that their central banks can print, then they will have debt defaults and deflationary depressions measured in the currency that they owe and can’t print.

All debt crises, even big ones, can be managed well by economic policy makers restructuring and monetizing them so that the deflationary ways of reducing the debt burdens (i.e., writing off and restructuring debt) and the inflationary ways of reducing debt burdens (creating money and credit and giving it to the debtors to make it easier for them to service their debts) balance each other. The key is to spread the paying back over time. For example, if the debt-to-income ratio needs to fall by about $50 \%$ to make it sustainable, a debt restructuring that spreads it out to be at a rate of $3 \%$ or $4 \%$ per year would be much less traumatic than one that is about $50 \%$ in one year.
Debt crises provide great risks and opportunities that have been shown to both destroy empires and provide great investment opportunities for investors if they understand how they work and have good principles for navigating them well.
If you try to focus on debt cycles precisely or focus your attention on the short term you won’t see them. It’s like comparing two snowflakes and missing that they are pretty much the same because they’re not exactly the same.

# That’s it in a nutshell.

In the rest of this study I will get into the mechanics in greater depth, show the actual archetypical sequences that have played out over 35 cases, look at how the Big Debt Cycle and Big Cycle that includes the other big cycles  (for instance, cycles of internal and external order) that started in 1944 and that we are currently in the late stages of have transpired relative to this template, and briefly look at the Chinese and Japanese Big Cycles and a number of other cases. The Japanese case is interesting because Japan is further along in its Big Debt Cycle. Notably its large debt and debt monetizations have led to the depreciation of its currency and debt, which led holders of its bonds to have losses of $45 \%$ relative to holding US dollar debt since 2013 and losses of $60 \%$ relative to holding gold since 2013. In the final chapters, I will share how I am processing the US today relative to this template, how the US could reduce the risk of an acute debt crisis, and how I read the Five Big Forces today.

# Chapter 2: The Mechanics in Words and Concepts

Note: This chapter gives unconventional concepts about the mechanics of how markets work that I believe would be valuable for professionals and aspiring professionals but are probably beyond the interests of others. I suggest that you give it a try to see whether or not it’s the sort of thing you’d like to get into.

Because everything that happens has reasons that make it happen, it appears to me that everything changes like a perpetual motion machine. To understand this machine, one needs to understand its mechanics, and because everything affects everything else, these mechanics are very complex. As a result of breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, I believe that we are on the brink of almost understanding it all, but for now we have to labor along the old-fashioned way, with people studying what happened using contemporary computers to aid them. That’s how I created this description of the mechanics of the debt/credit/money/economic dynamic, which is, of course, only one big part of the greater dynamic. In my feeble attempts to understand and describe the most important mechanics that change the world as we know it, I do these in-depth studies and then try to create more simplified explanations of them.5 Keep in mind that this is a very simplified picture.

Zooming out to the highest level, the five most important drivers of change that are important to understand are:

The debt/credit/money/economic cycle The internal political order/disorder cycle The external geopolitical order/disorder cycle Acts of nature (droughts, floods, and pandemics) Human inventiveness, most importantly of new technologies

These are the biggest forces that affect each other to shape the biggest things that happen. If you want to understand what I learned from experiencing and studying them in a more complete way than I can cover in this study, you can read about them in my book Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order.

In this study, we are going to examine the first of those—the credit/debt/money/economic dynamic—focusing most intensely on the late part of the longer-term debt cycle when central governments and central banks go broke. I will start by a) walking you through some mechanics of how market prices are determined and then b) looking at how the long-term debt cycle works. With that as a background, I will then turn to c) the archetypical sequence that leads to a country hitting the limits of debt and money and central banks and central governments “going broke.” At the same time, we will be exploring the other four forces because the interactions of these five forces cannot be overlooked in observing the resulting overall Big Cycle. From what I can see, we are likely entering the very turbulent stage in the overall Big Cycle driven by the interactions of these five big forces, and the resulting changes in the world order will be big. I hope this study can contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics and better decision making to produce the best outcome possible.

# How the Machine Works

To me, money and credit are the lifeblood of the economy. They circulate nutrients (i.e., spending power) from the parts of the system that have excess amounts of it to the parts of the system that can best use it. The central government is like the brain that directs how the system works while also taking in and using some of the money and credit (typically about $1 5 - 3 0 \%$ of it)6 to perform its functions (e.g., providing for social programs, defense, etc.). The central bank is like the heart that produces and pumps money and credit through the system. If the exchanges go well, and those who get capital use it productively, then the providers of capital, the users of it, and the economic system as a whole all prosper. If they don't, the system will become ill and experience trauma.

To be clear, viewing the debt dynamic as a cyclical, perpetual motion machine working in essentially the same way through time and across countries doesn’t mean that there are not changes over time and differences between countries. It’s just that these changes are comparatively unimportant in relation to the timeless and universal mechanics and principles that are far less well understood than they should be. To me, it’s invaluable to first see these timeless and universal principles of how the machine works and then focus on the differences and what they are due to because this approach provides a richer understanding of the cause/effect relationships. For that reason, I will start with these most important timeless and universal mechanics and principles. To convey them in brief, I will explain just the major ones in a big-picture, simplified way rather than a detailed and precise way. In this big-picture, simplified model, the following describes the major parts and major players and how they operate together to make the machine work.

# The Five Major Parts and How They Work

There are five major parts of the economic system that make up my simplified model of the machine. They are:

goods, services, and investment assets,
money used to buy these things,
credit issued to buy these things,
debt liabilities that are created when purchases are made with credit, and
debt assets (i.e., deposits and bonds), which, since one person’s liabilities are another’s assets, are the other side of the debt liabilities.

If you can understand the transactions that occur as being made up of these five major parts, you can pretty much understand why there are big debt and economic cycles. To start, I will walk through how I think about transactions, and some other important baseline mechanics.

As mentioned, goods, services, and investment assets can be bought with either money or credit.

Money, unlike credit, settles transactions. For example, if you buy a car with money, after the transaction, you’re both done. What has constituted money has changed throughout history and across currencies. For long periods of history, money was a promise to deliver a certain amount of gold or other hard asset. In fiat monetary systems, which we’ve been in since the US left the gold standard in 1971, money is what central banks print and is more like a form of credit in that it is a promise to deliver buying power, not an actual hard asset. But money is different from credit as, at this time, it can only be created by central banks7 and can be created in whatever amounts the central banks choose to create.

Credit, unlike money, leaves a lingering obligation to pay, and it can be created by mutual agreement of any willing parties. Credit produces buying power that didn’t exist before, without necessarily creating money. It allows borrowers to spend more than they earn, which pushes up the demand and prices for what is being bought over the near term while creating debt that, over the longer term, requires the borrowers, who are now debtors, to spend less than they earn as they pay back their debts. This reduces demand and prices in the future, which contributes to the cyclicality of the system. Because debt is the promise to deliver money and central banks determine the amount of money in existence, central banks have a lot of power. Though not exactly proportional, the more money that is in existence, the more credit and spending there can be; the less money in existence, the less credit and spending there can be.

Now let’s look at how prices are set.

To explain my approach for understanding how prices are set, which is different from the conventional economist’s approach, I need to start at the most basic building block for understanding all markets and economics, which is the transaction. All markets and all economics are simply the aggregates of the transactions that make them up, and a transaction is simply the buyer giving money (or credit) to a seller and the seller giving a good, a service, or a financial asset to the buyer in exchange. The price in a transaction equals the amount of money/credit the buyer gives divided by the quantity of whatever the seller gives in that transaction, and a market is the aggregate of those transactions. For example, a transaction to buy wheat occurs when a buyer gives a certain amount of total money to a seller in exchange for a certain quantity of wheat, and a market consists of all the buyers and sellers making exchanges for the same things—e.g., the wheat market consists of different people making different transactions for different reasons over time—and these many exchanges are what determine the price. So…

Price $\left( { \mathsf { P } } \right) =$ the amount spent on something (\$)/the total quantity of it that is sold (Q)

Or, more simply

$$
P = \$ 12
$$

In other words, since the price of any good, service, or financial asset equals the total amount spent by buyers (\$) divided by the total quantity sold by sellers (Q), if you know total spending (total \$) and you know the total quantity sold (total Q), you will know the price and everything else you need to know. That is indisputably how it is, so it is indisputable that the best way to estimate the price is to estimate the total spending and divide it by the total quantity sold. And what is the best way to estimate these things? It is to understand the motivations of the buyers and sellers. All buyers have their own reasons for spending the amounts of money that they are spending to get the quantity they are buying, and all sellers have their own reasons for selling the quantity they are selling to get the money they’re getting. What I’m saying is conveyed in the conceptual diagram below.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fa648591-86af-4ee0-8780-9f37c9a36f1a/70c4839cbc5d3929110714f11478a034a64f907ac0b918791640767be863c237.jpg)

While this might look and sound complicated, it’s really not. For each product, the buyers and sellers have their reasons for making those purchases and sales, and it’s pretty easy to determine who the main buyers and sellers are and what motivates them. If you can figure out major buyers' reasons for spending and you know the major sellers' reasons for selling, you can pretty accurately predict their actions, and thus the price.

This way of looking at price determination is very different from how most economists look at it. The traditional way measures both demand and supply in terms of quantity (i.e., quantity bought and quantity sold), where my approach looks at amount spent to buy instead of quantity bought. This leads to different ways of explaining why prices change. The conventional approach describes price changes as occurring because the quantity demanded and/or the quantity supplied changes. How these changes occur is called price elasticity. This way of looking at the market implies that there is one elasticity of demand and one elasticity of supply, and different theories emerge about how the market digests information.

I don't think that approach makes sense because it assumes that a change in supply will always have the same effect on price (i.e., elasticity), which isn’t true. For example, if more money is spent on a product because buyers have more money to spend, the price of that product will be higher. Ultimately, if your goal is to understand and predict price movements, you are much better off trying to connect who is doing what in the market with how prices are changing. I started doing this as a commodities trader back in the 1970s and found that, not only did this approach work better for me than more conventional approaches, it could also apply to all kinds of products and assets, including financial ones. In fact, I use this template to model not just how specific markets work but entire economies, but that’s a subject for another time.

If you play with the previously shown formula/model a bit, you will see that prices change when there are changes in the rates of spending and/or quantities sold. For example, if the rate of buying goes from (X) to (X minus $10 \%$ ), and all else stays the same, the price will fall by $10 \%$ . So, if you identify rates of unsustainable buying and/or rates of unsustainable selling, you can identify price and economic reversals ahead of them occurring. And if you calculate what a return to a more normal level of buying/selling is, you can calculate the approximate price change that is needed and likely.

There are a number of other implications for how this different approach leads to unique perspectives on how economies and markets work. But the most important one for understanding short-term market and economic cycles is that it shows how these cycles are driven more by creations of money and credit that lead to changes in spending (S) than by the changes in the quantity sold (Q) because most goods, services, and investment assets are produced to satisfy demand (i.e., in response to S). I also see that:

When a) more money and credit are created (so there is more spending) and b) producers have the capacity to produce more quantity, then c) there can be more non-inflationary growth because both spending (\$) and the quantity (Q) sold increase.

# whereas

When a) more money and credit are created (so there is more spending), but b) there is little or no capacity so producers can’t produce much more, then c) there is little real growth and a lot more inflation.

These principles explain why the early cycle (when there is plenty of excess capacity and central banks are stimulative) is characterized by strong growth and little inflation and the late cycle typically has weak growth and big price rises. That is what cyclical inflation and growth look like. Later in this study, we will go through this in more detail and explore what monetary inflations and inflationary depressions look like.

How does productivity fit into the above? If productivity growth is high, producers can produce more quantity (Q) as more money and credit are produced, so it allows non-inflationary growth to continue for longer. Of course, productivity can be hard to measure directly, as productivity can also show up as products improving in quality, or the marginal cost of producing something falling all the way to zero (as has happened for producing photos and electronic books).

Now let’s look more closely at the reasons buyers spend and sellers sell the quantities they sell. Instead of doing that for all the individual items, I will look at the big categories to convey the principles that affect them all.

People buy goods and services to use, and they buy investments to make money (i.e., as storeholds of wealth). How much they spend on goods and services versus investments depends on what the goods and services they want to use cost relative to the amount of money and credit they have to spend, and the relative appeal of spending on goods and services to that of spending on financial assets.

And of course, they have their own reasons for choosing which goods and services and which financial assets they buy.

What people choose to spend their money and credit on is based on the relative appeal of the items. People are constantly making comparisons in two dimensions: 1) one item for another (e.g., money for corn, gold, currency, just about everything else) and 2) the same item for delivery at different points in time (e.g., corn, gold, currency for delivery today versus for delivery a year in the future) based on their preferences. As a result, there is an enormous array of relative-appeal assessments to be made. Arbitrages and relatively sure bets are the most powerful types of bets in determining relative pricing.

Currencies are mediums of exchange and storeholds of wealth (in debt assets). In other words, they facilitate both transactions and investing.

Investments are exchanges of money and credit today for money and credit in the future.

All investment markets derive their value by providing money in two ways: through their yields and through their price changes. Together they make the total return. So, for all investments, total return $\mathbf { \sigma } = \mathbf { \sigma }$ yield $^ +$ price change.

By and large, all investment markets compete with each other on the basis of the total returns they provide. That is because a) most investors care more about the total returns they get than they care about whether it comes in the form of yield or price appreciation8 and b) there is an ability to arbitrage investments based on their total returns.9

To show how that works, let’s look at how investing in bonds would be compared with investing in gold to determine the price relationship. Because gold has no yield and a US Treasury bond has a yield of $\times \%$ (e.g., $5 \%$ ), it would be illogical for anyone to buy gold unless the price is expected to go up by more than $\times \%$ per year (e.g., $5 \%$ per year). Said differently, the market is priced for the gold price to rise by $5 \%$ relative to the price of Treasuries. Investors form their views about what will determine the gold price change (e.g., one big factor is the amount of inflation based on the amount of money and credit that is produced), and they look at the relative attractiveness of the $5 \%$ yield that the bonds are offering and the extent the gold price would appreciate due to the depreciation in the value of money. If they think that gold will rise by less than $5 \%$ , they can buy bonds and sell gold, and if they think gold will go up more than $5 \%$ , they can do the reverse. In either case, they’ll make money if they’re right. On top of this simple price analysis, there is a lot of financial engineering (e.g., leveraging and hedging) that turns one thing into the equivalent of another to make relative value bets and arbitrages that create a whole matrix of market prices.

An enormous amount of money is allocated in this way, and it would be easy to make a lot of money if the choices between options were easy. But because we know it’s not easy to make money in the markets, we can assume that the markets do a pretty good job of making these estimates and pricing assets correctly. At the same time, because I and others who have been successful at investing couldn’t have been successful at investing if the markets were perfect, we can assume that it’s not perfectly done and there are opportunities to make money in the markets if you have a better understanding than others. Anyway, my main point is that this is how to determine how markets are priced, which you will soon see is helpful in understanding the debt/credit/money/economic dynamic.

The expected rates of return on investment assets relative to the rate of inflation (i.e., the expected real returns of investments) will influence how much money goes into each of these. By and large an investment’s inflation-adjusted (“real”) returns are more important than its non-inflation (i.e., nominal) returns because a) investments are made to be storeholds of wealth so buying power matters most, and b) there are arbitrages and relative value bets between real assets and financial assets that drive their relative prices. In other words, the expected returns of putting money into financial investments are compared with the expected returns of putting money into real stuff (e.g., real estate, precious metals, commodities, art, etc.), so the returns of all investments, especially the returns of government bonds (because their returns are so well known since the yield is set and there is virtually no risk of default for bonds denominated in a country’s own currency), are compared with the inflation rate, so when bond yields are low relative to inflation, bonds will be sold and inflation assets will be bought, and vice versa. Also, because the decline in the value of money and credit that arises from central banks creating lots of both causes the prices of goods, services, and most financial assets to rise, when central banks create a lot of money and credit, that tends to lead investors to favor inflation-hedge assets.

Prices are linked by certain determinants that one must understand to understand relative pricing. When most non-professional investors think about the price, they usually think about the price for delivery of the item today, which is called the spot price. Most markets also have prices for deliveries sometime in the future, which are called forward (or futures) prices, and there are arbitrages or relative value bets that one can take that determine the price relationship of the same items at different delivery dates.10 The same sort of analysis of the relative appeal of the same financial assets (e.g., short-term government debt and long-term government debt) takes place (e.g., a big factor determining that is the projected pace at which the central bank will increase or decrease interest rates).

# Debt Is Currency and Currency Is Debt

Since a debt asset is the promise to receive a specified amount of currency at a future date, debt and currency are essentially the same things. If you don't like the currency, you must not like the debt asset (e.g., bonds), and if you don't like the bonds, you must not like the currency, if you take into consideration their relative yields. (In other words, if you don’t like one you must not like the other.) Remember the gold/bond price comparison process described earlier of looking at the relative yields $^ +$ the expected price changes $\mathbf { \sigma } = \mathbf { \sigma }$ the relative total returns. This sets the spot and futures prices for bonds and gold, and it works the same for assessing the value of different currencies and different debt assets of different countries. That assessment drives capital flows in important ways that are very relevant to the debt issue at hand.

More specifically:

Let’s say the government interest rate (which is widely considered default-risk-free because government central banks can print money to make payments) in one country (e.g., Japan) is below that in another country by $\times \%$ per year. If that’s the case, then the expected appreciation in that currency must be at the same percentage rate. Otherwise, it would be easy to make virtually risk-free profits (by owning the bonds with the higher interest rate). Instead, the difference in the interest rates is expected to be eaten up by the higher interest rate currency falling compared to the lower interest rate currency.

But what if that currency change is not expected to offset the interest rate difference? For example, if the 10-year interest rate in Country A is lower (e.g., $3 \%$ lower) than that in Country $\mathsf { B ^ { \prime } s }$ currency-denominated bond, you’d ordinarily expect Country A’s currency to rise (to eat up the difference from the higher interest rate). What if, instead, Country A’s currency is expected to fall (e.g., by $2 \%$ per year)? In that case, there is virtually risk-free profit to be made. Investors will flock into the trade, selling the lower-yielding currency/debt. That will produce one of two adjustments (or a combination):

A) the spot currency will have to fall (by $40 \%$ in this example11), or
B) the 10-year interest rate will have to rise by $5 \%$ , which will send the bond prices down by about 40%.12

Or if those adjustments can’t happen (say there are capital controls or the like)—if the interest stays $3 \%$ less and the currency falls by $2 \%$ —then the loss relative to holding Country $\mathsf { B ^ { \prime } s }$ bonds will be $5 \%$ per year, which over the 10 years will compound to $40 \%$ .

Any way you cut it, the bond return in Country A’s currency will be very bad.13 If the nominal bond returns are not bad (i.e., the bonds do not depreciate and debt burdens are not reduced in nominal terms) because neither a) the price of the bonds falls in the local currency because the interest rates rise to provide an appropriate return in light of the declining value of the currency, nor b) the currency declines to a level that makes it cheap enough to provide adequate price appreciation to make up for the interest rates being too low, then the bad return of the bond will come about because c) the annual interest rate and weakness in the currency will not compensate for the inflation.14

Now that we understand how the mechanics of these major parts work, and how transactions are driven by the motivations of players in dealing with those parts, you will understand how the machine works and what is likely to happen next, so let’s get into that.

# The Major Types of Players and How They Behave to Drive What Happens

Five major types of players drive money and debt cycles. They are:

those that borrow and become debtors that I call borrower-debtors, which can be private or government entities,
those that lend and become creditors that I call lender-creditors, which can be private or government entities, those that intermediate the money and credit transactions between the lender-creditors and the borrowerdebtors, which are commonly called banks,
central governments, and
government-controlled central banks, which can create money and credit in the country’s currency and influence the cost of money and credit.

Credit/debt expansions can only take place when both borrower-debtors and lender-creditors are willing to borrow and lend, so the deal must be good for both. Said differently, because one person’s debts are another’s assets, for the system to work, it takes both borrower-debtors and lender-creditors to want to enter into these transactions. However, what is good for one is quite often bad for the other. For example, for borrowerdebtors to do well, interest rates can’t be too high, while for lender-creditors to do well, interest rates can’t be too low. If interest rates are too high for borrower-debtors, they will have to slash spending or sell assets to service their debts, or they might not be able to pay them back, which will lead markets and the economy to fall. At the same time, if interest rates are too low to compensate lender-creditors, they won’t lend and will sell their debt assets, causing interest rates to rise or central banks to print a lot of money and buy debt in an attempt to hold interest rates down. This printing of money/buying of debt will create inflation, causing a contraction in wealth and economic activity.

Over time, environments shift between those that are good and bad for lender-creditors and borrower-debtors. To be effective, it is critical that anyone who is involved in any way in markets and economies knows how to tell the difference. This balancing act and the swings between the two environments take place naturally, and sometimes conditions make it impossible to achieve a good balance. That causes big debt, market, and economic risks. Before I describe the conditions that produce these risks, I want to first explain the other players’ motivations and how they try to act on them.

Private sector banks15 are the intermediaries between lender-creditors and borrower-debtors, so their motivations and how they work are important too. In all countries for thousands of years, banks have done essentially the same thing, which is to try to make profits by borrowing money from some and lending it to others, earning money on the spread. How they do this creates the money/credit/debt cycles, most importantly the unsustainable bubbles and big debt crises. How are these bubbles and crises created? By the banks lending out a lot more money than they have, which they do by repeatedly borrowing at a cost that is lower than the return they take in from lending. That works well for the society and is profitable for the banks when those who are lent money use it productively enough to pay back their loans—and when those the banks borrowed from don’t want their money back in amounts that are greater than what the banks actually have. But debt crises happen when the loans aren’t adequately paid back or when the banks’ creditors want to get more of the money they lent to the banks than the banks are able to give them.

Over the long run, debts can’t rise faster than the incomes that are needed to service them, and interest rates can’t be too high for borrower-debtors or too low for lender-creditors for very long. If debts keep rising faster than incomes and/or interest rates are too high for borrower-debtors or too low for lender-creditors for too long, the imbalance will cause a big market and economic crisis. For that reason, it pays to watch these ratios.

Big debt crises come about when the amounts of debt assets and debt liabilities become too large relative to the amount of money in existence and/or the amounts of goods and services in existence.

Central banks either directly or indirectly create money and credit, which is “buying power.” Buying power determines the total amount of spending on goods, services, and investment assets. Whatever amount of money and credit is created must be put into goods, services, and/or financial assets (i.e., investments). So, the total amount of money and credit created determines the total amount of spending on goods, services, and financial assets. As a result, goods, services, and financial assets tend to rise and decline together with the ebbs and flows of money and credit, like all boats tend to rise and fall with the ebbs and flows of the sea. What this money and credit go into and the quantities of goods, services, and financial assets that are produced are mostly determined by the choices made by thousands or millions of market participants.

Central banks came into existence to smooth these cycles, most importantly by handling big debt crises. Until relatively recently (e.g., 1913 in the United States), there weren’t central banks in most countries, and money that was in private banks was typically either physical gold or silver or paper certificates to get gold and silver. Throughout these times, there were boom-bust cycles because borrower-debtors, lender-creditors, and banks went through the credit/debt cycles I just described. These cycles turned into big debt and economic busts when too many debt assets and liabilities led to lender-creditor “runs” to get money from borrower-debtors, most importantly the banks. These runs produced debt/market/economic collapses that eventually led governments to create central banks to lend money to banks and others when these big debt crises happened. Central banks can also smooth the cycles by varying interest rates and the amount of money and credit in the system to change the behaviors of borrower-debtors and lender-creditors. Where do central banks get their money from? They “print” it (literally and digitally), which, when done in large amounts, alleviates the debt problems because it provides money and credit to those who desperately need it and wouldn’t have had it otherwise. But doing so also reduces the buying power of money and debt assets and raises inflation from what it would have been.

Central banks want to keep debt and economic growth and inflation at acceptable levels. In other words, they don’t want debt and demand to grow much faster or slower than is sustainable and they don’t want inflation to be so high or so low that it is harmful. To influence these things, they raise interest rates and tighten the availability of money or they lower interest rates and ease the availability of money, which influences lendercreditors and borrower-debtors who are striving to be profitable.

Central governments are political organizations with those who run them serving at the pleasure of the people, so they want to give the people what they want. This is typically done without paying for it, which typically leads to central government borrowing, which reinforces the cycle of creating greater amounts of credit stimulation early and debt depressants later. When central governments do their jobs well, they tax and spend in ways that make broad-based productivity and prosperity, sometimes borrowing more than they are earning and sometimes paying it back, and when central banks do their jobs well, they keep the credit, debt, and capital markets in relative balance, which produces less disruptive big swings. However, for the previously mentioned reasons, the bias to create more ups in the economies and markets through credit stimulation leads to long-term uptrends in debt and debt service relative to incomes until they become too large a percentage of income to be sustainable.

The greater the size of the debt assets and debt liabilities relative to the real incomes being produced, the more difficult the balancing act is, so the greater the likelihood of a debt-caused downturn in the markets and economy.

Because borrower-debtors, lender-creditors, banks, central governments, and central banks are the biggest players and drivers of these cycles, and because they each have obvious incentives affecting their behaviors, it is pretty easy to anticipate what they are likely to do and what is likely to happen next. When debt growth is slow, economies are weak, and inflation is low, central bankers will lower interest rates and create more money and credit which will incentivize more borrowing and spending on goods, services, and investment assets which will drive the markets for these things and the economy up. At such times, it is good to be a borrower-debtor and bad to be a lender-creditor. When debt growth and economic growth are unsustainably fast and inflation is unacceptably high, central bankers will raise interest rates and limit money and credit which will incentivize more saving and less spending on goods, services, and investment assets. This will drive the markets and economy down because it’s then better to be a lender-creditor-saver than a borrower-debtor-spender. This dynamic leads to two interrelated cycles—a short-term one that has averaged about six years in length give or take three years and a long-term one that has averaged about 80 years give or take 25 years—which evolve around an upward trend line in productivity that is due to humanity’s inventiveness.

I’ll now briefly review how these cycles transpire:

# The Short- and Long-Term (Big) Debt Cycles

By “short-term debt cycle,” I mean the cycle of 1) recessions that lead to 2) central banks providing a lot of credit cheaply, which creates a lot of debt that initially leads to 3) market and economic booms that lead to 4) bubbles and inflations, which lead to 5) central bankers tightening credit, which leads to 6) market and economic weakening. This cycle typically lasts about six years, give or take about three. As of this writing, there have been 12.5 of these in the US since 1945—i.e., at the time of my writing this we are about halfway through the 13th. Each short-term debt cycle typically ends with higher levels of debt than the previous cycle because policy makers try to end recessions by lowering interest rates enough to get borrowing going again.

By “long-term (big) debt cycle,” I mean the cycle of building up debt assets and debt liabilities over long periods of time (i.e., successive short-term debt cycles) to amounts that eventually become unmanageable. This leads to a combination of big debt restructurings and big debt monetizations that produce a period of big market and economic turbulence.

The short-term debt cycles add up to the long-term (big) debt cycles, which I will henceforth call the Big Debt Cycle.

These cycles move markets and economies around an upward-sloping trend line of rising living standards that is due to people’s inventiveness and the increases in productivity that come from it. The incline of its upward slope in productivity is primarily driven by the inventiveness of practical people (e.g., entrepreneurs) who are given adequate resources (e.g., capital) and work well with others (their coworkers, government officials, lawyers, etc.) to make productivity improvements.

Over a short period of time (i.e., 1-10 years) the short-term debt cycle is dominant. Over a long period of time (i.e., 10 years and beyond) the long-term debt cycle and the upward-sloping trend line in productivity have much bigger effects. Conceptually, the way this dynamic transpires looks like this to me:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fa648591-86af-4ee0-8780-9f37c9a36f1a/8cc97088e75d8439c238b20a133734298bcd8130983674d0ad939fdfb58f87a0.jpg)

What separates a sustainable debt cycle from an unsustainable one is whether the debt creates enough income or more to pay for the debt service. If incomes fail to grow as quickly as debt and debt service, the ratio of debts to incomes will mechanically grow, which will require increased borrowing to serve debt as well as to spend. The cycle goes from low to high to unsustainably high debt and debt service relative to incomes. A sure sign of moving toward a debt crisis is when there is a large and rising amount of borrowing that is being used to pay for the debt service.

Why don’t central bankers do a better job than they have been doing in smoothing out these debt cycles by better containing debt so it doesn’t reach dangerous levels? There are four reasons:

1) Most everyone, including central bankers, wants the markets and economy to go up because that’s rewarding and they don’t worry much about the pain of paying back debts, so they push the limits, including becoming leveraged to long assets until that can’t continue because they have reached the point that debts are so burdensome they have to be restructured to be reduced relative to incomes.
2) It is not clear exactly what risky debt levels are because it’s not clear what will happen that will determine future incomes.
3) There are opportunity costs and risks to not providing credit that creates debt.
4) Debt crises, even big ones, can usually be managed to reduce the pain they cause to acceptable levels.

Debt isn’t always bad, even when it’s not economic. Too little credit/debt growth can create economic problems as bad or worse than too much, with the costs coming in the form of foregone opportunities. That is because 1) credit can be used to create great improvements that aren’t profitable that would have been foregone without it and 2) the losses from the debt problems can be spread out to be not intolerably painful if the government is in control of the debt restructuring process and the debt is in the currency that the central bank can print. However, to avoid a debt crisis, debt must raise incomes to service the debts.

Over time, from one cycle to the next, debt liabilities and debt assets have virtually always increased to make the long-term debt cycle expansion. In virtually all cases that has continued until the debt burdens have become unsustainably large or the debt assets have become intolerably low-returning.

When there are a lot of debt assets and debt liabilities relative to incomes, it is difficult for central bankers to keep interest rates high enough to satisfy lender-creditors without having them so high that they unacceptably hurt borrower-debtors, and it is difficult for central banks to run monetary policy to balance growth and inflation well. And because holders of debt assets want to sell the debt, one way or another debt is going to have a bad return. That puts central bankers in the position of having to choose between:

1. Not printing money and buying debt (i.e., not monetizing debt) and letting interest rates rise enough to cut credit demand and economic activity enough to reach the indifference-equilibrium level that will balance the buying and selling of the bonds. This will make cash very valuable, devalue most other assets like stocks and hard assets, cause deflation, lead to debt defaults and restructurings, and depress economic activity. This typically happens first and is intolerable, which leads to central banks to start…
2. Printing money and buying debt (i.e., monetizing debt) to make up for the shortfall in demand, which will make money readily available and reduce its value thus raising inflation, raise the value of most other assets like stocks and hard assets, minimize debt defaults, and stimulate economic activity. This typically eventually happens.

At that part of the Big Debt Cycle, there need to be big reductions in debt liabilities and debt assets. These are the big debt crisis periods. These big debt restructurings and debt monetizations end the prior Big Debt Cycle by reducing debt burdens and eliminating the prior monetary order, leading to the next new Big Debt Cycle and monetary order. They take place much like big changes in domestic political orders and big changes in world orders—like seismic shifts due to the old orders breaking down. There are four types of levers that policy makers can pull to reduce the debt burdens:

1) austerity (i.e., spending less),
2) debt defaults/restructurings,
3) the central bank “printing money” and making purchases (or providing guarantees), and
4) transfers of money and credit from those who have more than they need to those who have less.

Policy makers typically try austerity first because that’s the obvious thing to do, and it’s natural to want to let those who got themselves and others into trouble bear the costs. This is a big mistake. Austerity doesn’t bring debt and income back into balance because one person’s debts are another person’s assets. Cutting debts cuts investors’ assets and makes them “poorer,” and because one person’s spending is another person’s income, cutting spending cuts incomes. For that reason, cuts in debts and spending cause a commensurate cut in net worths and incomes, which is very painful. Also, as the economy contracts, government revenues typically fall at the same time as demands on the government increase, which leads deficits to increase. Seeking to be fiscally responsible at this point, governments tend to raise taxes, which is also a mistake because it further squeezes people and companies. More simply said, when there is spending that’s greater than revenues and liquid liabilities that are greater than liquid assets, that produces the need to borrow and sell debt assets, which, if there’s not enough demand, will produce one kind of crisis (e.g., deflationary) or another (e.g., inflationary).

As touched on earlier, the best way for policy makers to reduce debt burdens without causing a big economic crisis is to engineer what I call a beautiful deleveraging, which is when policy makers both 1) restructure the debts so debt service payments are spread out over more time or disposed of (which is deflationary and depressing) and 2) have central banks print money and buy debt (which is inflationary and stimulating). Doing these two things in balanced amounts spreads out and reduces debt burdens and produces nominal economic growth (inflation plus real growth) that is greater than nominal interest rates, so debt burdens fall relative to incomes.

If done well, there is a balance between the deflationary and depressing reduction of debt payments and the inflationary and stimulating printing of money and buying of debt by the central banks. In the countries I studied, most big debt crises that occurred with the debts denominated in a country’s own currency were restructured quickly, typically in one to three years. These restructuring periods are periods of great risk and opportunity. If you want to learn more about these periods and processes, they are explained more completely in Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises.

# The Big Debt Cycle, Its Risks, and How to Deal with It Need to Be Better Understood

Because the really big debt crises that take the form of debt restructurings and devaluations that come at the ends of Big Debt Cycles happen roughly once in a lifetime, they are not well understood relative to the short-term cycles. That is why I did this study. Said differently, what ends long-term debt cycles is different from what ends short-term debt cycles, so most people don’t know about or acknowledge long-term debt cycles or worry about long-term debt cycles ending even though they’re much bigger deals than short-term debt cycles ending. That’s dangerous. It’s like eating fatty foods and having cholesterol accumulate in the heart as plaque and saying that it doesn’t seem to be causing trouble while it is increasing the probability of a heart attack.

Let’s remember what is healthy, which is 1) having private sector lenders give their credit in exchange for debt that works well for them and creditors because the uses of the funds were profitable and 2) for government borrowings to be used in ways that produce productivity gains (e.g., in better infrastructure, education, etc.) that can be paid for via tax revenue, or for the government to sometimes borrow and spend more than it takes in when the economy needs stimulation that is followed by paying it back when conditions are strong. And let’s remember what isn’t healthy, which is 1) the central bank chronically printing money and buying debt to make up for the shortage in demand for the debt and 2) the central government chronically having large deficits that result in debt and debt service levels rising faster than the incomes (in the government’s case, tax revenue) that are required to service them.

In Summary and to Reiterate:

Goods, services, and investment assets can be produced, bought, and sold with money and credit. Central banks can produce money and can influence the amount of credit in whatever quantities they wan

Borrower-debtors ultimately require enough money and low enough interest rates for them to be able to borrow and service their debts.
Lender-creditors require high enough interest rates and low enough default rates from the debtors in order for them to get adequate returns to lend and be creditors.
This balancing act becomes progressively more difficult as the sizes of the debt assets and debt liabilities both increase relative to the incomes. Eventually they need to be reduced, so a deleveraging happens.
The best type of deleveraging is what I call a beautiful deleveraging, which can be engineered by central governments and central banks to reduce debt burdens if the debt is in their own currencies. If the debts are denominated in a foreign currency the deleveraging is quite ugly. I will explain these later.
Over the long term, being productive and having healthy income statements (i.e., earning more than one is spending) and healthy balance sheets (i.e., having more assets than liabilities) are the markers of financial health.
If you know where in the credit/debt cycle each country is and how the players are likely to behave, you should be able to navigate these cycles well.
The past is prologue.

# Important Takeaways:

Debt crises are inevitable. Throughout history only a very few well-disciplined countries have avoided debt crises. That’s because lending is never done perfectly and is often done badly due to how the cycle affects people’s psychology to produce bubbles and busts.
Most debt crises, even big ones, can be managed well by economic policy makers if they are well spreadout.
All debt crises provide investment opportunities for investors if they understand how they work and have good principles for navigating them well.
Inevitably, at the beginning of the end of the Big Debt Cycle when there is a lot of debt, it is difficult to keep real interest rates high enough to satisfy lender-creditors without them being too high for borrowerdebtors, and central banks try to navigate between these choices. Typically, during these times, both the tight-money economic contraction and the loose-money inflation occur, and the only question is in what order. In any case, owning the debt/currency of overly indebted governments at such times is a bad investment.
Central banks have to choose between keeping money “hard,” which will lead debtors to default on their debts, which will lead to deflationary depressions, or making money “soft” by printing a lot of it, which will devalue both it and the debt. Because paying off debt with hard money causes such severe market and economic downturns, when faced with this choice central banks always eventually choose to print and devalue money. For the case studies, see Part 2 of Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises. Of course, each country’s central bank can only print that country’s money, which brings me to my next big point. If debts are denominated in a country’s own currency, its central bank can and will “print” the money to alleviate the debt crisis. This allows them to manage it better than if they couldn’t print the money, but of course it also reduces the value of the money.

The Other Four Big Forces Affect How This Debt Cycle Transpires Just as This Debt Cycle Affects How the Other Four Forces Transpire Together

Thus far, I have just spoken about debt cycles because that is the subject of this study. However, many factors interact to determine what happens, so I couldn’t ignore them and do my job well. They were covered extensively in my book Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order. While I showed 18 measures of the major drivers of conditions in the book, the big five that explain almost everything are: 1) the money/credit/debt/markets/ economic cycles, 2) the cycle of social and political order and disorder that takes place within countries, 3) the cycle of order and disorder that is manifest in the peace and war cycle that takes place between countries, and 4) acts-ofnature shocks such as droughts, floods, and pandemics, and 5) human inventiveness, especially of new technologies that increase productivity. The interactions between these forces drive how conditions change. They tend to reinforce each other both upwardly and downwardly. For example, periods of financial and economic crisis raise the odds of having periods of internal conflict, and periods of internal conflict worsen financial and economic conditions. Similarly, periods of internal financial problems and internal political conflicts both weaken the country that they are happening in and, if they are global, increase the likelihood of international conflicts. Together these forces create the Big Cycles of ups and downs, peace and wars, that occur in countries and between countries, that lead to big changes in domestic and world orders.

These big rises and declines are easy to see by monitoring the 18 forces (particularly the big five) that I’m sharing with you. For example, you can see the big evolutionary decline of great powers and their monies reflected in 1) the unwavering rises of indebtedness accompanied by the steady weakening of the types of monetary systems used to restrain credit-and-debt-growth-motivated attempts to raise credit and economic growth and 2) the decline of many indicators of health, such as the quality of education, infrastructure, law and order, civility, government effectiveness, relative to those other world powers.

I won’t now delve into how all these work—both because doing that would be too much of a digression and because it’s better explained in my book or even in my relatively brief video, both titled Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order. I will now delve into a description of the mechanics of the Big Debt Cycle in numbers and equations, which I will try to describe in an easy-to-understand way.

# Chapter 3: The Mechanics in Numbers and Equations

Warning: This chapter gets into debt mechanics including some simple equations that are helpful in calculating what is likely to happen related to the limitations of debt. I believe this material will be valuable for professionals and aspiring professionals and probably beyond the interests of others. I suggest that you give it a scan to grab the important concepts and then decide if you want to delve deeper into this material.

While in Chapter 2, I described in words how central governments and central banks typically get into financial trouble, in this chapter I will show numbers and equations that can be used to anticipate these financial troubles, including a few formulaic examples to illustrate how high debt burdens compound and create problems.

I will start by showing you the key drivers of debt sustainability and how they interact. Before I do, I will lay out what an “unsustainable” debt burden is. Ultimately, it’s simple: an “unsustainable” debt burden exists when the amount of money that comes in is less than the money that goes out, either because a) the amount in storage (i.e., savings) goes down and/or b) the amount borrowed goes up until one runs out of savings and/or one can’t borrow any more, at which time a debt failure occurs. Think of this money flow as being like a blood flow and think of income statements and balance sheets as the reports that show it. A healthy condition is when the amount that comes in from earning is equal to or greater than the amount that goes out from spending and debts don’t build up faster than incomes. This isn’t to say that debt growth is necessarily bad. If debts build up, but the money borrowed leads to incomes rising faster than the rate of debt service rises, that will lead to more money coming in than going out, which will be healthy. When debts grow faster than incomes, think of it like plaque building up in the arteries because it reduces the amount of income flow that can be used for spending or savings. That is because it leads to increased debt service payments that reduce the amount of income that can go toward spending. If the money flow is constrained too much, there is a default, which is the economic equivalent to a heart attack. Interest rates matter a lot because they influence the amounts that have to be paid a lot. They also influence the willingness of lendercreditors to hold and buy the debt assets and liabilities. As debt service becomes large relative to the amount of income and savings, a squeeze develops, which is when a debt problem occurs.

We can measure debt burdens in the following ways, and we know that as they become high and/or rise quickly, the risks of defaults and/or devaluations also become high. While there are about 35 indicators that I look at to assess debt risks, the four most important indicators are:

1. Debts relative to income. As debts get larger relative to incomes, all else being equal, the debtor will have higher interest and rollover payments each year, which will increasingly squeeze down the money that is left for other spending. There are two problems with high debts relative to income: 1) there is a greater risk that the large amount of existing debt won’t be rolled over by creditors and 2) it creates higher debt service payments as a percent of income, which reduces the amount of money that can go to spending, all else being equal. That brings me to the next measure.

2. Debt service relative to income. Debt service is the amount a debtor must pay in interest and principal payments to not default on its debts each year. As total debt service gets higher and higher relative to income, it will either squeeze out spending or require more borrowing, which will further increase debt service expenditures. As this happens, it leads investors to expect credit problems ahead and choose not to lend more and/or to sell the debt assets they already own, which causes credit problems to come about. To help estimate how debts and debt service will build up, I look at the rate of interest relative to the rate of income growth.

3. Nominal interest rates relative to a) inflation rates and b) nominal income growth rates (i.e., inflation plus real growth). I look at these for two reasons:

a) They show me how debt and debt service are likely to grow relative to incomes. For example, if someone has debts of $100 \%$ of income, the nominal interest rate is $5 \%$ , and the nominal income growth rate is $3 \%$ , they will owe about $102 \%$ of income next year (assuming their spending is equal to their income).16

b) They show me how attractive credit conditions are for lenders relative to borrowers. If nominal interest rates are high relative to nominal growth rates and inflation rates that is an indicator that conditions are relatively favorable for lenders and unfavorable for borrowers, which will encourage lending and discourage borrowing/spending (i.e., it reflects greater risk of debt problems among more indebted debtors that can’t print money to pay debt). If the reverse is true, conditions are relatively unfavorable for lender-creditors and favorable for borrower-debtors, which will encourage borrowing and discourage lending.

4. Debts and debt service relative to savings (e.g., reserves). If all of the above are not financially healthy but one has large savings to draw on and draw down, one won’t have a high risk of default because one can draw on the savings (e.g., reserves) to make debt and spending payments.

Inevitably, equilibrium levels of 1) debts relative to incomes, 2) debt service relative to incomes, 3) nominal interest rates relative to inflation rates (i.e., real interest rates) and nominal growth rates, and 4) debts and debt service relative to savings will be approached. If you watch these ratios over time, you will see them go to extreme levels and return to more normal levels one way or another. If you understand the cause/effect relationships that drive these changes, you can understand how to navigate them and how they can be best managed. Most importantly, if you understand the painful deleveraging part, you will understand that it can be handled well (to be less painful) or handled poorly (and be very painful).

These four indicators are not the only ones that matter. In Chapter 4, I’ll show you how a broader set of indicators evolve through the end of the Big Debt Cycle, and in Chapter 15, I’ll show you what my indicators suggest for the US today. However, the previously mentioned four are the most important ones to watch. They give us valuable information about how likely a debt squeeze is and how severe it will be when it happens. However, they cannot tell us exactly when the debt problem will occur because different conditions and different people’s reactions to them lead to different lead times for the selling of debt assets and other actions that precipitate a crisis. Still, we can measure the level of risk because countries with very high debt levels, very large deficits, low savings, and very high and very fast rising interest rates have a very high risk of a debt default or debt devaluation crisis.

The rest of this section goes through a few formulaic examples to illustrate how high debt burdens compound and create problems.

# Measuring Debt Burdens in Numbers

What follows are the mathematical relationships for measuring these indicators. These are just the commonsense constraints on the amount of debt an entity can have, expressed in equations which are the same constraints that you can have expressed in words. To help you understand them, you might relate to them the same way you relate to your own debt constraints. I will explain the rules and include a few helpful rules of thumb. The pages that follow will explain each of these with examples. Not only can these relationships help one to identify debt problems, but they can be used to help policy makers see how to fix them and help market participants position themselves well. Feel free to skip this and come back if it’s more helpful to see examples first and then the math.

1) Future debts relative to future income. The formula to estimate this is:

(𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭 𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬 𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬 𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰 − 𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭 𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹) $^ +$ 𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪 𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫 $*$ (𝟏𝟏 +  𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰 𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹)

𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪 𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹 $*$ (𝟏𝟏 +  𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮 𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹)

In words: Future debt relative to revenue is a function of 1) spending more or less than one makes in revenue, 2) the “compounding” of one’s existing debts, and 3) revenue growth. As one’s expenses grow relative to one’s revenue, one is forced to borrow more to finance the spending, which increases new borrowing (first numerator term). As interest rates rise, existing debts grow faster (second numerator term). As revenues grow, incomes grow relative to debts, so the ratio of debt to revenue falls (denominator term).

Debt/income is a good indicator of risk because the larger it is, the riskier and the more burdensome the debt is, all else being equal. For example, the more debt there is, the more risk there is that the debt won’t be rolled over and the more difficult it is for the central bank to keep interest rates low enough to satisfy the borrower-debtors without having them too high for the lender-creditor. You can probably already see that, in addition to the level of debt/income mattering, the interest rate, income growth rate, and primary deficit (expenses excluding interest versus revenue) matter a lot to how debt burdens evolve.

We can also reconfigure this formula to solve for ways to keep the debt-to-income ratio the same. We will show a few different examples of this at the end of this chapter.

In words: Future debt service relative to revenue is a function of future interest costs and principal payments, relative to how much revenue grows. If revenue grows a lot, debt service will fall relative to incomes, all else equal.

Future interest costs are a function of the debt level and the average interest rate on debt. If interest rates shoot up, it generally will not immediately make the interest costs for a debtor go up, because on their longer-term bonds, the interest rate will be locked at the interest rate at the time of issuance. As the bonds “roll”—i.e., come due and are reissued at the new interest rate, the bonds will gradually get to have higher interest rates on them, and interest costs will rise.

Principal payments are the amount of debt that is coming due each year that must be paid back, typically via issuing new debt to pay back the old debt that comes due. A rough way to estimate principal payments is by calculating the average maturity—or time until debts must be paid back—on existing debts. When debtors are stressed, creditors typically will not want to lend to them for as long, so we often see the maturity of debts falling as creditors become more stressed, which means principal payments go up for the same level of debts.

3) Nominal interest rates relative to a) inflation rates and b) nominal income growth rates (i.e., inflation plus real growth):

The expected level of nominal interest rates relative to nominal growth rates tells us how debt and debt service is likely to grow or shrink. Below, we show the formula for the interest rate that would keep debt levels and interest debt service flat relative to revenue. Note that this is based on the first formula, just reconfiguring that formula to give us the required interest rate to keep debts flat relative to revenue.

To walk through this in words, if the primary deficit is zero (i.e., current expenses before interest $\mathbf { \tau } = \mathbf { \tau }$ current revenue), debts will stay flat if the interest rate is equal to the revenue growth rate. If the primary deficit is $5 \%$ of the current debt level, interest rates would need to be $5 \%$ below the revenue growth rate.

The intuition here is that if the interest rates are equal to revenue growth, debts will compound at the same rate that income is growing. If the government is also borrowing, debts need to compound slower than income, so interest rates need to be below revenue growth rates.

As interest rates rise relative to revenue growth rates, debts will grow relative to incomes because existing debts will compound faster than revenue is growing, and interest debt service costs will grow even faster because both the debt level will grow and the interest rate will be rising, and interest costs are the product of these two inputs. Similarly, as interest rates fall, debt levels will grow less quickly and interest debt service costs will grow even less or shrink. (This is, for instance, what has happened in Japan over the last 20 years. I will show this in more detail in Chapter 14).

You can probably see that, just as you can solve for the interest rate required to keep debts flat, you can also solve for the deficit or surplus required, revenue growth required, and so on. If you flip to the end of this chapter, I show you what these numbers look like for the US and Japan today.

4) Debts and debt service relative to savings (e.g., reserves): Just as we can estimate debt burdens relative to income, we can estimate them relative to savings—simply by looking at the level and change in savings rather than the level and change in incomes. The formula to estimate this is as follows:

𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭 𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫 𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺 (𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭 𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰 𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪 + 𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭 𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷 𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷)𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭 𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺 𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪 𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺 + 𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬 𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺

These formulas are very similar to (1) and (2), so I will not fully walk through them in words. The difference is that we are looking at debts and debt service relative to savings. If one has large debts but very large savings, it is less likely that the debt burdens are concerning, because one can pay the debt service and pay back part of the debts using the savings. It creates a buffer.

If one is consistently running deficits, and the expected surplus is negative, you can see that debts and debt service will quickly grow relative to savings, creating a more concerning setup.

A few rules of thumb that help to convey how these equations play out:

If nominal interest rates are at the same level as nominal income growth and a government is running no primary deficit (i.e., revenue $\mathbf { \tau } = \mathbf { \tau }$ spending excluding interest), the debts will stay the same relative to the incomes. But if interest rates are higher than income growth, then the debt burdens of existing debts will increase. This is probably the single most important variable in our calculation. For example, a bad but plausible period of nominal interest rates to nominal growth would be interest rates being higher than income growth by $2 \%$ . This would cause the debt-to-income ratio to increase by around $50 \%$ over 20 years, even without primary deficits, leading to more borrowing and debt. This means that if you start with debts of $50 \%$ of income, they’ll go to $7 5 \%$ , but if you start with debts of $4 0 0 \%$ , they’ll go to $600 \%$ . Debt service expenses accumulating is like plaque in the arteries accumulating in that it squeezes out the desired flow of nutrients to the economy. The main effect of high debt levels is making the debtor vulnerable to not being able to roll it forward.

These mathematical relationships can provide us with good estimates of the magnitudes of debt service squeezes that will occur if the existing levels of debt are rolled over. However, they don’t show the dynamic that happens when holders of debt assets want to sell the debt they are holding. In this next section I will explain all these things.

Now I will go through a few examples to illustrate how these drivers work and interact with one another.

# Example 1: Debts Relative to Incomes (Levels and Changes)

As starting debt levels grow, and as deficits (i.e., borrowings) grow, future debt levels, debt service, and interest costs all grow. The table below shows a range of outcomes. The debt-to-GDP ratio, which is more commonly quoted, is not as relevant to the government’s debt service picture as its own debt-to-income ratio. That is because for any debtor, including central governments, what matters most is the amount of money that goes out (in this case, in debt service) relative to the amount of money that comes in, because that is what creates the debt squeeze; the size of GDP is only partially related.18 Both are only rough indicators of the capacity of the economy to bear the debt burden.

For reference, the US government’s debt to money coming in (mostly tax income) is, as of this writing, about $58 0 \%$ . Expenditures excluding interest are projected to average $\sim 1 1 5 \%$ of income over the next decade, so the primary deficit—the difference between these—is $\sim 1 5 \%$ of income.19 The US is also borrowing $\sim 2 0 \%$ of its income each year to cover interest expenses on the existing debt.

If we assume that interest rates equal income growth but use the actual projected primary deficit for the US (i.e., the actual gap between non-interest expenses and income), the US government’s debt-to-income is projected to rise by about $1 5 0 \%$ , from $580 \%$ to $730 \%$ over the next 10 years. This would also lead to a proportional increase in the interest expense and debt service burden.

The table below shows debt levels 10 years forward for various starting debt levels and deficits. The second table shows the change relative to the starting debt level. You can see that as the starting debt level rises, and as deficits become larger, the expected debt level at the end gets higher.

China extensively uses local governments and local governent financing vehicles to fund government spending, so we are including these entities in our government debt figure and including local government spending in our revenue and deficit figures.

# Example 2: The Effects of Nominal Interest Rates Minus Nominal Income Growth Rates on Debt-to-Income Ratios

When interest rates are higher than income growth rates, the existing debt grows relative to incomes because the debt compounds faster than incomes grow.

The tables below illustrate how this works. Previously, we showed how debt grows for different starting debt levels and deficits. This time, we are assuming a starting deficit of $3 5 \%$ of income (using the CBO’s projected primary deficit over the next decade).20 The rows below are still different starting debt levels. The columns now show the nominal interest rate minus the nominal income growth rate. The CBO projects that, over the next decade, effective interest rates will average $3 . 4 \%$ and the US will have $3 . 8 \%$ nominal growth. The difference is $- 0 . 4 \%$ , so this would leave the US around the red-boxed area below.

The first table below shows the levels of debt to income 10 years from now based on these assumptions, and the second table shows the change in debt to income over the 10 years. As interest rates get higher than growth, debt levels grow faster. Also, as debts get higher, the impact of high interest rates gets worse much faster.

Previously, we forecast that with current debts and deficits, US debt levels will rise from $5 8 0 \%$ to $730 \%$ of income. If we also incorporate projected interest rates relative to nominal growth, we’d expect US debt levels to rise to $67 \%$ of income (assuming taxes stay a constant share of GDP). You get the idea.

Since interest rates are projected to be slightly below nominal growth, this adjustment doesn’t change our debt outlook much for the US today. But you can see that if the central bank wanted to help the central government keep its debt burdens more manageable, it could push interest rates to further below nominal growth by buying the government bonds, which would cause debt burdens to grow much slower, all else equal. Of course, that wouldn’t be good for the lender-creditors holding the debt assets because they would get a lower nominal interest rate and a lower real interest rate than they would have gotten. I suspect that you are beginning to get the picture of how this dynamic works and has worked in the past—e.g., why central banks created such low nominal rates (near $0 \%$ ) and such negative real interest rates by printing money and buying government debt—and what is most likely to take place in the future if the current path isn’t altered. More specifically, if debt growth remains as projected, central banks will have to push real interest rates lower, which will make debt assets less attractive for lendercreditors.

In an economy, there are many interrelated drivers that change interdependently. It’s like a Rubik’s Cube, in which changing one part of the cube—one driver in the grids shown previously—causes changes to the other parts. It gets complicated to understand how these drivers interrelate and to project scenarios. To help illustrate this, we created a simple model to walk through one scenario for the next decade.

Let’s start by considering Example 3 below, with a government that has numbers similar to the US government now. Let’s say nominal income is growing at $3 . 8 \%$ a year, interest rates are $3 . 4 \% ,$ and debt levels start at $58 0 \%$ of government income. In this example, we’ll assume that the government spends $3 5 \%$ more than it collects in income, including interest payments.

# Example 3: Interest Rates Spiral Upward to Keep Buyers in the Debt Assets

Since this government is running a $1 5 \%$ primary deficit (i.e., excluding interest payments), it collects $\$ 5.2$ trillion in revenue and spends $\$ 6$ trillion in Year 1. It must pay $\$ 1.1$ trillion in interest, because it started with debts at $58 0 \%$ of government income, and interest rates are about $4 \%$ . Let’s assume that about $3 5 \%$ of the existing debt is coming due this year (which is about how much US government debt matures every year) and will need to be rolled over— so $\$ 10.3$ trillion of existing debt will come due this year and will need to be paid back. In total, this government needs to sell $\$ 12.2$ trillion of debt in Year 1. What happens if the public is no longer willing to buy this debt, or is a seller at current interest rates?

Markets must clear, so this means that interest rates will go up until someone is willing to buy these bonds. But as the interest rates go up, that makes the government’s borrowing even more expensive, meaning the problems get even worse, creating a greater desire to sell the bonds, which creates even more upward pressure on interest rates. A spiral of rising interest rates leading to worsening credit risk, leading to less demand for the debt, leading to higher interest rates is a classic “debt death spiral.” In the table below you can see how this works. In this example, I show interest rates going up by $0 . 5 \%$ a year while nominal growth stays flat.

If interest rates stayed flat, the government would have ended Year 10 with debts at $67 \%$ of income and interest at $2 2 \%$ of income. Here, relative to income, we end with debts at $89 8 \%$ , interest at $6 8 \%$ , and total debt service (including principal payments) of $3 5 3 \%$ . Of course, if interest rates are going up because the debts are unsustainable, they’ll only go up more as debts rise and become even more unsustainable. And at the same time, the high interest rates are likely constricting income growth, increasing the challenge of debt sustainability. Of course, the worst-case scenario is one where a significant additional amount of debt assets is sold (i.e., to fund a war or social benefits in a recession), which would drive interest rates up a lot more.

A government can prevent this spiral of rising rates by reducing its debt burdens. I laid this out in more detail in my book Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises, but, to reiterate, there are four ways to reduce debt burdens for a government:

Austerity (i.e., spending less), which doesn’t work because one person’s spending is another’s person’s earnings, so austerity causes a self-reinforcing deflationary contraction.
Debt defaults/restructurings, which reduce debt burdens and are deflationary because one person’s debts are another’s assets.
The central bank printing money and making purchases of debt, which reduces debt burdens because it provides the money to pay the debts and is inflationary.
Transfers of money and credit from private market players who have money to the government via taxes, which is then transferred to other private market players.

When I looked at historical cases of private debt problems, I typically saw a mix of these levers being pulled, with a strong bias to print money and buy debt (i.e., monetize debt) when the debt squeeze is big. I also saw the fight over increased taxes as well as big conflicts between those of the left and those of the right. That all occurs for logical reasons. When central governments are squeezed, it’s a big deal because central governments are typically the largest part of the economy and the only part of the economy to pay for large amounts of non-economic social expenses, which are critically important at such times, when economic conditions are bad. If governments are slow in providing spending and financial support, it’s likely that that will create a larger economic downturn, which counterintuitively worsens debt burdens by reducing income growth and net worths and could lead to social turmoil. As a result, for overly indebted governments to cut their spending to deal with their debt problems at such times is self-damagingly painful. Then the question is: where does the government get its money from?

The easiest path, though not the best path for the long-term health of the system, is for governments to resolve their debt problems and spend as they would like to spend by having the central bank print money and purchase the bonds, thereby holding interest rates down at tolerable levels and putting money into the system. As a result, that is what they will unfailingly do when the debts are denominated in their own currencies. Let’s look at an example of how this works.

# Example 4: Central Bank Steps in Because Private Players Are Unwilling to Hold the Desired Amount of Government Bonds to Keep Interest Rates at the Desired Level for Acceptable Economic Growth

Thus far, we looked at how the starting debt-to-income ratio, the income growth rate, the spending growth rate, the interest rate, and the maturity of the government debt affects future debt burdens. Also, as mentioned, the demand for the debt matters a lot, and the central bank can, and typically does, print money and buy (i.e., monetize) debt. Let’s now look at how this last piece works.

There are many factors that determine the private market’s demand for government debt. As previously explained, these include the expected real return of bonds relative to the projected real returns of other assets, the total amount of money and credit in the system, the sense of impending risk of a debt/currency crisis, etc.

While these factors are measurable, they are much harder to project than the previously described determinants. However, they are observable most importantly in the form of either a) interest rates going up while the economy and the currency are weak (due to the supply/demand imbalance worsening) or b) central banks spending reserves and/or printing money and creating debt to buy government debt to try to lower real and nominal interest rates by increasing the demand to eliminate the imbalance. In the next chapter, you will see how this typically happens, and signals for the transition to the debt/currency crisis.

Before we move on, I wanted to show you how it works for the central bank to step in and absorb excess debt supply in order to maintain interest rates and liquidity at a desired level. Let’s start with our previous example and modify it slightly. Let’s assume that in Year 1, the government has $\$ 10.3$ trillion of debt expiring and is issuing $\$ 12$ trillion of new debt to replace the expiring bonds, pay interest, and cover spending.

Rather than allowing interest rates to spiral upward to generate sufficient demand for these debt assets, let’s assume the central bank steps in and buys all the excess issuance, so that the private sector continues to hold no more than $600 \%$ of government income in debt, and interest rates stay flat at $3 . 4 \%$ . In this example, in Year 2, the central bank will have to buy $\$ 0.3$ trillion of those debt assets. In subsequent years, these purchases get larger and larger.

Mechanically, to purchase these debt assets—i.e., monetize the government debt—the central bank prints money (by creating new reserves/cash) and gives private players that money in exchange for the bonds. This increases the money supply (M0). In this example, let’s assume that the money supply starts at $\$ 5.6$ trillion—so $1 1 0 \%$ of the starting government income—roughly where it is today in the United States. In our example, as the central bank prints more and more to cover government shortfalls, the money supply balloons.

This is a rough example, but you can see the general contours of how this works for real economies. As an economy needs lower and lower interest rates to keep debt burdens manageable, there is less and less private demand for the debt at those lower interest rates, which requires the central bank to step in. The more the central bank steps in, the more it is forced to increase the money supply, which devalues money and makes holding debt less desirable.

That is because, all else being equal, central bank money and credit creation lowers the value of money, which increases inflation and currency weakness. The relationship is not precise and depends on how exactly the printed money is transmitted through the economy. Lowering interest rates and increasing the supply of money lowers the attractiveness of the currency, which makes holding the debt denominated in that currency unattractive.

# In the tables below, I wanted to give you a sense of how much money gets printed and how it affects the currency.

In the first table, the rows represent different starting debt-to-income levels for a government, and the columns represent how many bonds private players are willing to purchase at current interest rates. As a government has more of a debt problem, and as private players are willing to hold less of the debt, the money stock increases more. The red box reflects the scenario laid out above, where the central bank buys $\$ 7.7$ trillion of bonds, increasing the money stock from $\$ 5.6$ trillion to $\$ 13.5$ trillion.

This range corresponds to the example above

Buying up bonds and increasing the money supply is stimulative and puts downward pressure on the currency in two ways:

Mechanically, pushing down interest rates usually causes the currency to sell off. Why? To spell out the mechanics:

Usually, all else equal, lowering an interest rate won’t change investors’ long-term expectations of the value of a currency. The 10-year forward currency doesn’t move as much.
If you are getting less interest in the meantime because interest rates fell, the new deal is strictly worse. The way to make the new deal fair again is for the spot currency to fall. That way, you’ll earn more through currency appreciation (as it reaches the same expected 10-year forward point) to make up for less in interest.

My next point will be too technical for some and helpfully technical for others, so if you want to skip the technical stuff, skip it. Mechanically, pushing down interest rates pushes up the currency forward—e.g., a rise in one country’s 10-year sovereign, risk-free bond yield relative to another country’s 10-year risk-free bond yield will raise the 10- year forward currency—so if the value to investors of the currency in the 10-year future were to stay the same, the spot currency would have to sell off by the present value of the 10-year interest rate differences to keep the 10-year currency forward flat. Said more precisely and more simply: as explained in Chapter 1, the difference in sovereign interest rates in two countries will be offset by the forward currency premium—e.g., if the interest rate in Country A is $2 \%$ above the interest rate in Country B, then the forward currency of Country A will be at a $2 \%$ per year annual discount to Country B, so if interest rates in Country A were lowered by $1 \%$ from that level and the forward currency stays the same, the currency would weaken by a corresponding amount.

Also, the printed money can directly flow out of the currency, creating a selling pressure in the currency. That is, as a central bank buys bonds and gives other players cash, there is a chance that they use that cash to buy other currencies, rather than holding it or buying assets/spending in the same economy.

In the next table, we show a range of outcomes for how this might work. The columns again reflect different willingness to lend by private players (as you go to the right, private players are less willing to lend to the government). The rows reflect how sensitive the currency is to the money supply. As the market sees a currency as a worse and worse store of value, we’d expect the currency to become more sensitive to the money supply, because other players will be less willing to hold it. For example, let’s assume that printing $1 \%$ of GDP in money led to ${ \sim } 1 \%$ currency weakness, then in the example above, we’d expect a $\sim 1 5 \%$ currency depreciation. As the currency becomes more sensitive to the amount of money (i.e., M0), and as the private sector becomes less willing to lend, we’d expect to see more and more currency weakness.

# What level of interest rates can make debt burdens affordable for a country?

In these examples, we looked at how debts can compound to become unsustainable. I also wanted to show you the numbers around how debts can be managed sustainably.

In countries that have a lot of debt and high deficits, debts and debt service costs will be a big issue and how much they will increase over time will be determined by the interest rate relative to income growth and inflation, as shown in our calculations. A central bank can prevent debt service costs from rising or cause them to decrease relative to inflation and incomes by pushing down nominal interest rates below nominal growth rates. What I am referring to are the impacts these things will have on the central governments and the central bank’s financial conditions. Of course, they will also have a ripple effect on all parts of the economy, but let’s skip that for now.

Given that, we can look at a government’s debt level and projected deficit and calculate what interest rate will be needed to produce any specified level of debt and debt service relative to incomes—e.g., to keep the debt burden the same, to have it decline, etc.—given estimates of future revenue and expenses.

If I were setting policy for the Fed, I would want to look at what the deficit and debt levels are and likely will be and set an interest rate so that debt burdens won't become too great over time. For example, I would probably want to look at what interest rate would keep debt service payments the same. That would affect my interest rate policy.

I would also want to calculate what level of interest rate would be needed for my central bank not to have big losses on my balance sheet.

Let's look at these things and also look at how they would have worked in the past.

# Formula For Determining Future Debt Burdens

As a reminder, the equation below shows the drivers of future levels of debt and debt service relative to incomes.
This is more fully explained at the start of this chapter.

(𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭 𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬 𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬 𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰 − 𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭 𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹) $^ +$ 𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪 𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫 𝐱𝐱 (𝟏𝟏 +  𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰 𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹)

In the table below, I use this formula to estimate what interest rates would stabilize debt burdens relative to incomes for the US today. We also show how each of the other available “levers” would have to change in order to stabilize debt burdens. You can see that to stabilize government debt burdens, the US would either need to see nominal interest fall to about $1 \%$ , see nominal economic growth average about $6 \%$ $1 2 . 5 \%$ additional inflation above the $3 . 8 \%$ nominal growth projected by the CBO), or raise government revenue (i.e., raising taxes) by $1 1 \%$ . Of course, each one of these paths would be intolerably too large so it will take the right combination of lesser amounts of these to successfully achieve the goal. In Chapter 16, “My $3 \%$ Solution: How the US Could Stabilize Its Debt Burden,” I show what I believe the best combinations would be to achieve the goal of limiting debt burdens and risks in a very tolerable way.

# Part 2:

# The Archetypical Sequence Leading to Central Banks and Central Governments Going Broke

I think that all the chapters in Part 2 are very interesting and valuable to skim through by reading what’s in bold and then opting into the more embellished non-bolded material as you like.

# Chapter 4: The Archetypical Sequence

In examining 65 major debt crises over the last 100 years and in examining more closely the 35 cases in which the central government and/or the central bank went broke, I believe that I have come to understand big debt crises pretty well. What follows is the archetypical process, zooming in to the granular mechanics of what typically happens both leading up to central governments and central banks going broke and after. While I think this section is important because it shows how the template and actual developments have looked in detail, if you don’t want to go into all that detail, I suggest you read what is in bold and decide if you want to dive into the greater detail from there. But first, there is one important factor to explain that affects how the cases transpire. That is between cases with hard money versus fiat money.

# Hard Money Versus Fiat Money

The cases I am about to describe come in two broad types that typically behave differently in ways that you should understand. The two big types are the hard currency cases and fiat currency cases. In brief, the way the hard currency cases work is that the governments have made promises to deliver money that they can’t print (e.g., gold, silver, or another currency that the parties view as relatively hard, like the dollar). Throughout history, in these cases, when coming up with these hard currencies that they couldn’t print to pay debts became tough, the governments have almost always reneged on their promises to pay in the currency that they couldn’t print, and the value of their money and the debt payments denominated in it tumbled at the moment the promise was broken.

After they their promise but not going back to having a hard currency, they have what is called a fiat monetary system. In these cases, the currency’s value is based on the faith and incentives that the central banks provide. The shift of most currencies from being hard to being fiat currencies started on August 15, 1971. I remember it well because I was clerking on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the time and was surprised by it; then I studied history and found that the exact same thing happened in April 1933, and I learned how they worked.

In fiat monetary systems, central banks primarily use interest rates, their ability to monetize debt, and the tightness of money to provide the incentives of lender-creditors to lend and hold debt assets. And throughout history they, like central governments and central bankers operating in hard currency regimes, have created too much debt (which are claims that people believe they can turn in to get money, which they expect they can use to buy things), so there are the same type of credit-debt dynamics at work—i.e., the governments create and allow their private sectors to create too much debt to be paid back which leads to printing money to make it easier to pay the debts which devalues money and makes the prices of things go up—except in fiat currency cases the devaluations don’t happen all at once at the moment the government breaks its promise to convert the paper money into the hard money storehold of wealth. They happen more gradually.

For example, we have seen this clearly exemplified in the Bank of Japan’s policies of aggressively monetizing a lot of debt and keeping real and nominal interest rates extremely low, which has resulted in its currency and the debt denominated in its currency being devalued. Since the start of 2013, the holders of Japanese government bonds have lost $60 \%$ versus gold, $45 \%$ versus US dollar debt, and $6 \%$ in domestic purchasing power (as average inflation was $1 \%$ ). The devaluation came gradually rather than abruptly because the yen was a fiat currency, but it came for the same reasons it would have come if Japan had a hard currency—i.e., too much debt that needed to be monetized.

In the charts that I will show you throughout this chapter, you will see three lines—the bold one in the middle will show all cases (the hard and the fiat currencies combined) and the two lighter lines will show you what happened on average in just the hard currency cases and what happened on average in just the fiat currency cases. For simplicity, I will explain the dynamic by referring to just the aggregate line.

By the way, the big cycles through history have typically included currency regimes going back and forth between being hard and fiat because they each led to extreme consequences and required movements to the opposite—the hard currency regimes broke down with big devaluations because the governments couldn’t maintain debt growth in line with their monetary constraints, and the fiat monetary system broke down because of the loss of faith in the money/debt being a safe storehold of wealth.

# Nine Stages of the Final Crisis

In the introduction I summarized the whole archetypical debt cycle. I am now going to focus on the final phase of the Big Debt Cycle, when the central government and the central bank both go broke. This final phase typically transpires in nine steps. While the sequence below is the archetypical one, there are very big variations in what happens and when it happens, and they don’t necessarily transpire in the exact sequence I describe. So, the things I am referring to here can be viewed as the unhealthy things that lead to the crisis and the steps that are classically taken to get out of the crisis. The more of these unhealthy things exist, the greater the risk of a “heart attack” where the central government and the central bank go broke. Said differently, there are many reasons a country goes broke—e.g., chronic overspending and debt accumulations; costly wars; costly shocks like droughts, floods, and pandemics; some mix of these things; etc. Whatever the causes, the below checklist adds up to a risk gauge because the more of the unhealthy things that exist, the higher the probability of a debt/currency crisis. Here is the sequence of unhealthy conditions that typifies the last stages of the Big Debt Cycle:

1) The private sector and government get deeply into debt.
2) The private sector suffers a debt crisis, and the central government gets deeper in debt to help the private sector.
3) The central government experiences a debt squeeze in which the free-market demand for its debt falls short of the supply of it. That creates a debt problem. At that time there is either a) a shift in monetary and fiscal policy that brings the supply and demand for money and credit back into balance or b) a selfreinforcing net selling of the debt, which creates a severe debt liquidation crisis that runs its course and reduces the size of debt and debt service levels relative to incomes. Big net selling of the debt is the big red flag.
4) The selling of government debt leads to a simultaneous a) free-market-driven tightening of money and credit, which leads to b) weakening of the economy, c) declining savings/reserves, and d) downward pressure on the currency. Because this tightening is too harmful for the economy, the central bank typically also eases credit and experiences a devaluation of the currency. That stage is easy to see in the market action via interest rates rising, led by long-term (bond) rates rising faster than short rates and the currency weakening simultaneously.
5) When there is a debt crisis and interest rates can’t be lowered (e.g., they hit $0 \%$ or long rates limit the decline of short rates), the central bank “prints” (creates) money and buys bonds to try to keep long rates down and to ease credit to make it easier to service debt. It doesn’t literally print money. In doing this, it essentially borrows reserves from commercial banks that it pays a very short-term interest rate on, which creates problems for the central bank if this debt selling and interest rate rising continue.
6) If the selling continues and interest rates continue to rise, the central bank loses money because the interest rate that it has to pay on its liabilities is greater than the interest rate it receives on the debt assets it bought. When that happens, that is notable but not a big red flag until the central bank has a significant negative net worth and is forced to print more money to cover the negative cash flow that it experiences due to less money coming in on its assets than has to go out to service its debt liabilities. That is a big red flag because it signals the central bank’s death spiral (i.e., the dynamic in which the rising interest rates cause problems that creditors see that lead them not to hold the debt assets which leads to higher interest rates or the need to print more money which devalues the money which leads to more selling of the debt assets and the currency, and so on). That is what I mean when I say the central bank goes broke. I call this going broke because the central bank can’t make its debt service payments, though it doesn’t default on its debts because it prints money. When done in large amounts, that devalues the money and creates inflationary recessions or depressions.
7) Debts are restructured and devalued. When managed in the best possible way, the government

controllers of fiscal and monetary policy execute what I call a beautiful deleveraging in which the deflationary ways of reducing debt burdens (e.g., through debt restructurings) are balanced with the inflationary ways of reducing debt burdens (e.g., by monetizing them) so that the deleveraging occurs without having unacceptable amounts of either deflation or inflation.

8) At such times, extraordinary policies like extraordinary taxes and capital controls are commonly imposed.
9) The deleveraging process inevitably reduces the debt burdens and creates the return to equilibrium. One way or another the debt and debt service levels are brought back in line with the incomes that exist to service the debts. Quite often, there are inflationary depressions so the debt is devalued at the end of the cycle, government reserves are raised through asset sales, and a strictly enforced transition from a rapidly declining currency to a relatively stable currency is simultaneously achieved by linking the currency to a hard currency or a hard asset (e.g., gold) by the central bank, and the central government and private sector finances being brought back in line to be sustainable. At the early stage of this phase, it is imperative that the rewards of holding the currency and the debt denominated in it, and the penalties of owing money, are great in order to re-establish the creditability of the money and credit by rewarding the lender-creditors and penalizing the borrower-debtors. In this phase of the cycle there is very tight money and a very high real interest rate, which is very painful and required for a while. If it persists, the supply and demand for money, credit, debt, spending, and savings will inevitably fall back into line. How exactly this happens largely depends on whether the debt is denominated in a currency that the central bank can create and whether the debtors and creditors are primarily domestic so that the central government and the central bank have more flexibility and control over the process. If so, that makes the process less painful, and, if not, it is inevitably much more painful. Also, whether the currency is a widely used reserve currency matters a lot because when it is there will be greater marginal inclinations to buy it and the debt that it is stored in. Having said that, it should be noted that throughout history there has been a strong tendency for governments with such currencies to abuse that privilege by doing more than enough borrowing to lose that privilege, which makes their decline more abrupt and painful.

In the next few chapters I will show you all this happening in charts.

# Chapter 5: The Private Sector and Central Government Debt Crisis (Stages 1-4)

In Chapter 4, I laid out the archetypical sequence that you see across crises . Now I go into much more detail on each phase—showing the specific markers and dynamics I saw when I looked at historical cases. I will show this dynamic in charts accompanied by brief explanations. In the charts, the dark blue line shows the average of all cases, the thin red line shows the average of the fixed exchange rate cases, and the thin green line shows the average of fiat-variable exchange rate cases. You will note that the timing and the distinctiveness of these events is clearer in the cases in which exchange rates are fixed (in which case they more cleanly intensify and then break) than in the fiat currency cases (in which the adjustments are more fluid). That is because in fixed rate cases you can see the pressures build up until there is a clear break, whereas in the variable exchange rate cases you will see these changes occur more gradually.

# Stage 1: The private sector and government get deep in debt.

We see this in classic ways, such as:

In the years before the crisis, the government classically has a large and growing stock of debt as a result of chronic deficit spending. Typically, one sees a rising share of spending going to consumption/social safety net and a declining share going to productivity-enhancing investment, causing debts to increase without a commensurate increase in incomes. Typically, countries become so reliant on a large social safety net that cutting it becomes a political third rail (e.g., in Brazil today, the US today).

The level of debt is typically high relative to the government’s ability to pay it back with tax revenues and the debt service burden is also high relative to the government’s incomes, starting to crowd out spending on other line items that are considered essential. To cover these costs, more debt needs to be sold than the private sector wants to buy, a source of upward pressure on interest rates (further increasing debt service costs). Note the big differences in what happens in these cases between the floating rate currencies and the fixed rate currencies after the big default/devaluation moment. It reflects the fact that in the fixed exchange rate cases the debt restructuring is more severe and definitive, which sets the stage for a more abrupt and larger rebound. Fiat cases see a gradual increase in debt, as money printing from the central bank allows government spending to continue or even accelerate. Please note that the numbers in the x-axis represent months before and after the peak of the crisis.

The charts below show the typical amount of government borrowing (in total and excluding borrowing to cover interest payments) that was done in the years leading up to the devaluation. In 31 of the 35 cases we studied, we saw large, persistent government deficits going into the crisis.

It’s worth noting that sometimes the public sector balance sheet looks less problematic on its face. This is true when there is heavy borrowing in the private sector that the public sector has to back up and when there are implicit public sector guarantees to backstop institutions such as banks that the government can’t afford to let fail. Such cases might as well be public sector balance sheet problems.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/68b05bf6-0171-4bbd-aaac-dab7b8a958c9/97bed92a0ecbfd436887e9901e14c0f3543201e97fd9d80b5c97d6ac9cb6a021.jpg)

The buildup of debts requires large lending from foreigners to finance them. That lending can be in borrowing the country’s currency (which increases the risk of devaluation) or a reserve currency (which increases the risk of default). This increases the country’s vulnerability to a pullback in foreign capital. Having said that, having a current account deficit doesn’t necessarily signal problems. It reflects capital coming into the country, which could be indicative of the attractiveness of the country’s capital markets. However, in circumstances in which the attractiveness of the country’s capital markets gets impaired by the need to issue a lot of debt and money quickly to deal with a crisis, the potential for foreign selling of the country’s currency and debt represents an added source of vulnerability. As shown in the next set of charts, steadily increasing current account and twin deficits typically lead the crisis by several years. When the crisis occurs, it takes the form of a big devaluation and a constriction of debt-financed demand (including for imports), which has the effect of reducing these deficits.

Large current account deficits

Years of large borrowing from foreigners results in a substantial accumulated debt to foreigners, which increases the country’s vulnerability to a pullback in foreign capital. The charts below on the left show the total net international investment position (assets owned abroad minus liabilities owed to the rest of the world) and an adjusted version on the right that measures the amount of liquid assets the country has available relative to the external debts it must service. By the time of the devaluation, the country is typically very low in liquid assets it can use to cover external debt service obligations.

# Stage 2: The private sector suffers a debt crisis, and the central government gets deeper in debt to help the private sector.

Typically, this occurs at the stage of the cycle when the government’s balance sheet goes from being moderately stretched in the years ahead of the devaluation to extremely stretched when the government is forced to step in to address debt problems that emerge in the private sector. When the private sector has financial problems, the government typically plays an increased role because it can get money and credit much more easily than the private sector can. During these difficult times, it is easier for governments to borrow because there is much more willingness to lend to them because everyone knows that their central banks can print money and get it to governments to repay and because governments have the power to tax. Having this greater ability to borrow is especially true for those governments that have the most established reserve currencies because there is high demand to hold that currency/debt.

As a result, when debt conditions deteriorate and governments need to save the day, government debt increases faster than private sector debt. As shown in the charts below, it is typical for the government debt level to soar while the private sector’s debt level plunges about a year before the crisis, and for the government debt levels to rise a lot relative to private debt levels. In 15 of the 21 cases where we had data on both the government and the private sector balance sheet, we saw this pattern happen. When private debt is falling sharply and government debt is rising sharply, it is a short leading indicator of trouble.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/68b05bf6-0171-4bbd-aaac-dab7b8a958c9/5dd509689802151f08d92f06361a45543e37adb1947f74b128ee6411f52eb504.jpg)

At this time, government debt problems tend to intensify. We show a few more measures of this below.

The stock of government debt grows in relation to 1) its revenues, 2) the hard assets it has available to repay its debts (usually in the form of reserves), and 3) the quantity of money in the economy that is available to finance the debt (until the central bank eventually steps in to provide more money and credit to the government).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/68b05bf6-0171-4bbd-aaac-dab7b8a958c9/6cc58fe38506f38cd399239a1a73b5a3370e513ec4898fdfe3c92bb5ab42dfa9.jpg)

Stage 3: The central government experiences a debt squeeze in which the free-market demand for its debt falls short of the supply of it. That creates a debt problem. If there is net selling of the debt, that creates a much worse problem, so net selling of the debt is a big red flag.

The central government gets into financial trouble when 1) its finances are squeezed by debt and debt service expenses that limit its ability to spend on what is essential and 2) the holders of the debt assets created to finance government spending want to sell those assets. This puts upward pressure on interest rates, further increasing the government’s financing costs and requiring either painful spending cuts or even more borrowing to cover those costs.

More specifically, when debt service becomes a very high percentage of income (e.g., $1 0 0 \%$ ), it is a red flag because it means that it is a) squeezing out a lot of spending and/or b) requiring a lot of borrowing and debt rollovers that might not happen because lender-creditors see this situation and worry about it, leading them to not lend or sell their debt assets. There comes a time in the long-term debt cycle when the debt service becomes so large relative to the incomes that it either squeezes out other spending because the borrowing can’t be large enough to allow the avoidance of the squeeze, or because it is so large that it leads to a big demand shortage. In 25 of the 35 cases we studied, we saw government debt service as a percent of government revenues accelerate going into the crisis.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/68b05bf6-0171-4bbd-aaac-dab7b8a958c9/603373ac13d6db2768f40a959ed10844acf21f522fad71c0c0dd3840cbe008a5.jpg)

Given the debts the government has built up (and the ongoing deficits it is running to compensate for a weak private sector), its debt and debt service burdens are on a path to continue climbing. The charts below show the average projected path of government debt and interest expense at the time of devaluation across the historical cases. At the time of the eventual devaluation, we can see that the government was typically on a path toward indefinitely increasing debts and debt service absent a devaluation of those debts.

…along with growing debt service burdens relative to tax revenues

This hasn’t happened yet in the US, but it is moving toward happening. As far as Europe, Japan, and China go, government interest service in those places is around half that of the US as a percent of GDP—Europe and China because its government debts are lower (though the debts of other sectors are higher), and Japan because its interest rates have been much lower for a long time. But that can change quickly, especially in Japan where very high government debts (around $21 5 \%$ of GDP) could become a problem if refinanced at higher rates. As we will see later, the very large government debts, Bank of Japan bond purchases, and the BoJ artificially holding interest rates at extremely low levels led to terrible returns for government debt assets because of both the low yields on the debt and the depreciated value of the currency.

Faced with a large and growing debt burden and financing need, a classic next step is the pursuit of measures to paper over issues and creative ways to source financing, including accounting tricks:

1. Use of policy and development banks to create off-balance-sheet financing (frequently part of the playbook in Asian crises, e.g., Japan and Asian financial crises).
2. Use of debt guarantees instead of direct spending (Peru 1980s, Turkey recently). The government will say that it guarantees losses for a certain type of debt, which encourages borrowing—effectively a subsidy. But it doesn’t show up in government spending until losses start to appear, so it can misleadingly seem “free” to the government. In 2017, the Turkish government rolled out a loan guarantee program for businesses in the midst of balance of payments pressure.
3. Requiring or heavily incentivizing domestic players, especially banks, pensions, and insurers, to finance the government (Turkey recently, Brazil recently). Sometimes this takes the form of extremely beneficial regulatory treatment of government debt (making a risky instrument seem risk-free), and sometimes manipulation of yield curve and financing rates to make it attractive (US during World War II), which is effectively backdoor monetary financing (because it incentivizes banks to lever up at short-term interest rates to lend to the government).
4. Patriotic campaigns to get people to fund the government (Turkey recently appealing for people to sell their dollars for lira, World War II appeals for people to buy government bonds, Korea 1990s relatively successfully creating a campaign asking people to use their gold to pay back the IMF).
5. “Paying” for increased spending with future cuts and tax increases that might never come (Brazil recently, creating a constitutional amendment to limit spending, but creating plenty of outs when needed).
6. Calling in favors from international creditors and/or making geopolitical deals for financing (Turkey recently, UK setting up Sterling Area after World War II).

7. Shortening maturities of debt, since usually borrowers are more willing to lend for short periods than long (described further below). 8. Capital controls to keep money from leaving the country are common in relatively severe situations.

Stage 4: The selling of the government’s debt leads to a) a free-market-driven tightening of money and credit which leads to b) a weakening of the economy, c) downward pressure on the currency, and d) declining reserves as the central bank attempts to defend the currency. Because this tightening is too harmful for the economy, the central bank eventually simultaneously eases credit and allows a devaluation of the currency.

These events typically accelerate investors’ and savers’ flight from the country’s assets, bringing the run on the currency and the debt to a breaking point. Typically, the central bank attempts to defend the currency with monetary tightening and reserve sales but is ultimately forced to change course due to the painful economic effects of tightening and the inadequacy of its reserves.

A relatively large red flag for me is when debts rise relative to the incomes that are necessary to service them to such an extent that smart investors recognize losses are inevitable (i.e., because there must be either a default or a lot of printing of money, currency weakness, and inflation to depreciate the debts in order to avoid a default).

When the lender-creditor loses faith that they will be adequately paid (because the debtors won’t be able to afford to pay debt service or because the amount of debt service isn’t sufficient—e.g., won’t adequately compensate the lender-creditor for inflation), there will be inadequate buying relative to the selling of debt so the price of debt will have to go down (so the interest rate will have to go up) until there is either less borrowing or more saving.

During times of risks of war or actual war this is worsened because risks of sanctions (i.e., confiscating debt assets), excessive borrowing, debt default, and devaluation increase. Wars or not, that is when the doom loop can kick in— i.e., when the upward pressure on interest rates weakens the economy and increases the government’s future borrowing needs (or requires big tax increases or spending cuts that would be excessively painful at this juncture) which then creates an even bigger supply/demand mismatch in the bond market and puts even more upward pressure on interest rates. That is when central banks have to come in to save the day by “printing money” and buying the debt and we have what we call quantitative easing (QE).

As you will see in the charts below, in these times there is a simultaneous plunge in foreign inflows to buy local bonds, government and corporate (left chart), and a spike in real rates as there is a classic failed attempt to support the currency via rising interest rates and tightening credit.

In these periods, we often see the government shorten the maturity of its issuance in order to make the bonds more palatable to the market.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/68b05bf6-0171-4bbd-aaac-dab7b8a958c9/48dfb78769e99ef526295995f7f7e6bade4403b8b665812e973bf39f6857f927.jpg)

When market participants see that these limitations are being reached there is selling, which worsens the supply/demand balance. When that becomes large the central bank is faced with the choice of a) allowing interest rates to rise to a level that will curtail borrowing and lead to greater desire to lend to the government by redirecting money and credit that would have gone to other things (e.g., the purchase of other investments), or b) printing money and buying the debt to make up for the demand shortfall. History shows and logic dictates that it will always choose b) over a), and that the best path is to balance a) and b). When that produces enough selling so that inflation rises when the economy is weak, the central bank is damned if it does print money and buy a lot of debt because it contributes to terrible currency weakness and inflation, and it’s damned if it doesn’t because it causes extremely tight money, extremely high interest rates, and a very bad economy.

That happens when the debt service squeeze becomes intolerable for the borrower-debtor and/or the lendercreditor doesn’t want to hold the debt (typically because it is not providing a high enough real return, the risk of default is perceived as high, and/or the risk of the central bank printing a lot of money thus devaluing it is high). When those things happen a doom loop downward spiral in the value of the government debt occurs until a new equilibrium level is reached when the debt is sufficiently destroyed or devalued so that the debt burdens are no longer excessive.

This hasn’t yet happened in the US, Europe, Japan, or China.

Below, we walk through these dynamics in more detail.

There is a tightening and/or currency intervention to defend the currency, but the tightening is abandoned because it’s too harmful for the economy and the currency intervention is abandoned because it doesn’t work and is too costly, so the currency/debt devalues.

This situation becomes untenable when investors and savers see what’s going on and make the logical decision to abandon the country’s assets and currency because there is a high risk that in one way or another they won’t get their buying power back. This brings the crisis to a head because it puts more pressure on the central bank to tighten at a time when doing so would likely produce unacceptably bad economic outcomes. A few of the red flags of this more advanced stage are:

Interest rates rise because there is selling of the country’s debt assets and because the central bank typically attempts to tighten to defend the currency. In the face of such depressed conditions, such an increase in real interest rates is unsustainable as it puts too much pressure on an economy that is already weak and on a government that is facing a debt spiral absent lower interest rates.

The tightening worsens a weak economy (which ultimately requires the tightening to be abandoned and the devaluation to occur).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/68b05bf6-0171-4bbd-aaac-dab7b8a958c9/1295d6561bb0f6829599960eb839876d96cfd3149b1822fc7b311598bcc76ff3.jpg)

While not always the case, inflation tends to rise and become higher than desirable going into the crisis (constraining the central bank’s ability to ease without risking undesirable high inflation).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/68b05bf6-0171-4bbd-aaac-dab7b8a958c9/5f096b2432e34a2f408a89921505d2f7865f3e423289ea9044b7b7e1dd4d73c7.jpg)

Due to the weak economy and the rising inflation, there is substantial pressure for the currency to fall. At this stage, there is a big divergence between the floating rate and fixed rate cases. The policy makers in fixed rate cases are fighting against currency depreciation. In fact, with high inflation the currency is getting more expensive right when they need a devaluation. In the floating rate cases, the currency is gradually selling off into the economic weakness.

For countries with hard currency debts, credit spreads rise as markets price in a greater likelihood of default.

Risky assets price in higher risk premiums (i.e., sell off), adding to the downward pressure on the economy.

At this stage, the central bank typically sells reserves. Remember that debt works for governments pretty much the same way it works for people and companies except that governments that have the debt denominated in their own currency and have the ability to print their own currency can print the money to pay off their debt. Also, as for people and companies, governments can build up savings to help them prevent financial problems when their incomes fall short of their expenses. For that reason, when looking at the riskiness of any debtor, including governments, one should also see what amount of liquid savings they have. Reserves are one of the main forms of liquid savings for governments. So are sovereign wealth funds. Watching their size, how fast they are being drawn down, and how close they are to running out is important to identifying the timing of debt problems. In the process, it pays to watch for the selling of foreign currency and buying of local currency, which is typically done. Because this reduces the money supply, it is a form of tightening. As shown in the chart below, the selling of reserves is typical at this stage of the cycle.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/68b05bf6-0171-4bbd-aaac-dab7b8a958c9/72dc8b25ae8dc0d95134f27aa8246cb516b59a0bb53a02b1cc73aaff386b2c0b.jpg)

Note that in the most severe cases, reserves are typically already low relative to the central bank’s liabilities (e.g., the stock of money that savers hold), which gives these central banks little firepower to fight the run on the currency. When that is the case, it becomes apparent that their currency defense will fail, which increases the betting against the currency and the fleeing of debt denominated in it.

The table below shows in more detail past interventions of central banks via their reserves across all the cases with meaningful intervention. What you can see is that:

Typically, before the central bank intervenes by selling reserves, the country has a modest war chest of reserves (on average around $5 \%$ of GDP covering $10 \%$ of the outstanding money supply and government debt outstanding).

To stem capital flight, during the intervention phase the central bank typically spends over half of its reserves in total to defend the currency (reserves in global currency terms have fallen by $6 2 \%$ on average).

Typically, a lot of this selling is concentrated in a relatively short period of time—for example, in the worst six-month period of intervention reserves decline by $4 9 \%$ in the median case.

Typically, the currency falls during the currency defense phase (gold rallies $42 \%$ in the median case)— though in some cases the central bank’s intervention is able to temporarily prop up the currency. Then, after a roughly two-year defense (though it of course varies by case)—the central bank gives up. At this point the reserves back only a small amount of the money stock $6 \%$ on average) and a tiny amount of the government debt $3 \%$ on average). After the central bank stops intervening, the currency falls further (and on average gold has rallied another $51 \%$ in the median case). The different cases are shown below.

Before the central bank intervenes by se ling reserves, the country has a modest war chest of reserves (in the typical case, around $5 \%$ of $G D P ,$ cover ng around a tenth of the money supply and government debt outstanding.

To stem capital flight and currency weakness, during the intervention phase, the central bank typically spends over half of its reserves in total to defend the currency. Typically, a lot of this selling is concentrated in a relatively short period of time—for example, in the worst six-month period of intervention reserves decline by $49 \%$ in the median case. Then the central bank stops spending reserves on trying to hold the currency up because it sees that it will fail at that and the prospect of having no reserves is scarier than the prospect of the currency falling.

The currency generally falls during the currency defense phase (gold rallies by $42 \%$ in the median case)—though

After a roughly two-year defense (though it of course varies by case)— the central bank gives up. At this point, the reserves back only about $6 \%$ of the money stock and $3 \%$ of the government debt. After the central bank stops intervening, the currency sells off (gold rallies another $51 \%$ in the median case).

Gold excess return figures are dashed out for cases where the currency bottomed before reserve intervention stopped. We show $" < - 1 0 0 \% "$ in cases where the central bank spent more than their entire warchest of reserves (for instance via using a swapline to borrow additional reserves).

At this stage, it becomes relatively clear that the currency is at best highly risky and at worst a very bad deal. This leads to not just investors leaving the debt/currency, but in many cases participants in the economy—most importantly banks, corporations, and households—making prudent/de-risking moves out of the debt and currency. Here are many of the dynamics we saw in the cases we studied which I consider classic signs of being in the late stages of the debt cycle:

Corporate Treasury Actions

1. Domestic companies decide to keep international revenue offshore principally in foreign FX (i.e., dollars), not converting them back to local currency like they used to. Seeing their revenues swing in local currency terms even as dollar prices stay more stable, they begin to think of their local currency as the currency to hedge, even though in traditional investing they should hedge the foreign currencies.
2. Domestic corporations decide to increase their amount of hedging of the local currency, especially those with hard currency debts. Hedging involves a forward contract to sell the local currency and buy foreign currency, which lowers the forward exchange rate and drags down the spot exchange rate.
3. Similarly, foreign corporations with domestic subsidiaries ensure cash is promptly swept out of the country.
4. Companies decide their foreign subsidiaries aren’t worth the hassle—navigating the currency risk, political chaos, sometimes career risk, for a small expansion opportunity doesn’t make a lot of sense. New FDI projects are put on hold.

Domestic Bank Actions

5. The banks that were forced to buy the debts under government policies have to sell them when liquidity dries up—accelerating the debt sell-off in the worst of the crisis.
6. Some of the central bank tactics to keep conditions stimulative (multiple interest rates, capital controls) make it more attractive to keep money offshore than onshore. Domestic banks and corporations are often the ones best placed to make that market. Even if kept in the same currency, money leaving the domestic banking system often means selling government debt.

International Bank Actions

7. International lenders close lines of business that are too much of a headache—trade financing, working capital lines of credit, etc.
8. Often, they literally sell or give away their bank subsidiaries when it is not worth the exposure to losses that a small subsidiary has on the broader corporation (let alone the headache of paying attention to this corner of the business).

Large International Investor Actions

9. Ironically, even as borrowing grows, more of it is held by players who can’t sell (e.g., banks), and the dollar value of the assets fall. Liquidity dries up, pushing out large foreign investors who don’t like illiquid assets.
10. There are moves out of the currency by large government reserve holders, often with geopolitical considerations a big part of the decision.
11. Often, big international reserve allocators can’t really sell their assets—it would be too disruptive to the market. Instead, reserve managers start accumulating all new reserves in a different currency—causing demand to dry up.
12. Relatedly, international investors can’t sell their assets (too little liquidity), but they don’t roll the exposures.

The outflows from foreigners are classic and tend to lead the devaluation.

Domestic Saver Actions

13. Domestic savers decide they want diversification, and to some degree begin betting on inflation-hedge assets, which drives flows in that direction. They convert bank deposits to hard currency, requiring banks to sell local currency to buy foreign currency.
14. People buy real goods to get ahead of inflation. Since a share of these real goods are imports, it creates a currency sale. This of course also fuels inflation and makes matters worse.
15. High-net-worth individuals, mostly concerned about wealth preservation and rising taxes and wealth confiscation, move money abroad.
16. Domestic savers see holding foreign stocks as the more reliable bet. More products pop up to make that possible.
17. Opening foreign bank accounts, since domestic banks look troubled, looks like the prudent move. Those banks make it easy to exchange to other currencies (assuming the government hasn’t imposed capital controls; in many cases the government makes opening foreign bank accounts quite difficult).

More Traditional Speculative Trading

18. Bond vigilante market action emerges and becomes self-reinforcing.

19. Equity investors pull out of the country as the environment deteriorates, which creates a negative currency impact.

# Chapter 6: The Crisis Spills over to the Central Bank (Stages 5-6)

This chapter continues to go through the dynamics I laid out in my archetype of a big debt crisis. Here we will focus on Stages 5-6, when problems spill over to the central bank.

Stage 5: When there is a debt crisis and interest rates can’t be lowered (e.g., they hit $0 \%$ ), the central bank “prints” (creates) money and buys bonds to ease credit and make it easier to service debt. It doesn’t literally “print money.” In doing this, it essentially borrows reserves from commercial banks that it pays a very short-term interest rate on.

Ultimately, the government can’t escape that it needs to find much more financing for its spending priorities. But at this stage, it typically experiences financing rates higher than it can afford—often because of mechanical selling of the currency and debt. At this stage, needing financing the government turns to the central bank. This puts the problem in the central bank’s court.

History shows that during such time central banks typically produce a lot of money and credit to buy the bonds. I view this as a red flag, but not yet a big red flag because of the power of central banks to control the production of money and credit. In the case of central governments and their debts, it will be difficult to avoid the squeeze if the deficits continue because the high debt burdens cause increasing amounts of government spending to be directed to debt service. We will get into an examination of the US government’s finances later.

More specifically, the central bank steps in to relieve the pressure on the government’s finances (or the finances of other systemically important entities) either through the direct purchase of assets or indirectly through guarantees and backstops. The central bank often takes losses on these assets if they were bought at uneconomical prices in the form of default, inflation, and/or rising interest rates. At this stage, the balance sheet hit is transferred from the government to the central bank and the holders of the currency.

As previously explained, when there isn’t enough demand for government debt, the central bank will be faced with the choice between either a) having interest rates rise enough to bring supply and demand into balance, which will reduce both the demand for credit and spending, or b) printing money and buying debt assets, which will expand the central bank’s balance sheet via quantitative easing, which means acquiring a lot of debt assets. If these things continue for a long time they should be viewed as early-stage red flags. Also, when governments shorten the maturities of their debt, which typically happens when there isn’t enough demand for their long-term debt, that should be viewed as an early-stage red flag, too. And, when both a) the total debt and b) the government debt that is held by the central bank rises because there isn’t enough free-market demand to buy the debt, that should be viewed as an early-stage red flag, as well. As shown in both charts below, these trends toward greater central bank holdings of bonds and shortening of maturities typically start nearly a decade before the crisis and reverse after it. Notice the acceleration of central bank bond buying and how the maturity of the government debt is rapidly shortening.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/68b05bf6-0171-4bbd-aaac-dab7b8a958c9/d203fd261989b2ba13820e1190757fc3293c2115b1c31f2fbb8d66a5794d5932.jpg)

As mentioned earlier, when the system is working well, the demand to borrow from borrower-debtors and the willingness to lend by lender-creditors balance. However, when the free-market demand for the debt that is being sold is not adequate, the central government and the central bank take on more of the debt when the private sector can’t. The government can do this when the private sector can’t because lender-creditors will more readily lend to the government during times of stress because they believe that the central government will pay it back because it is the central bank that has the power to print money behind it so there is virtually no risk that it will default. The risk becomes that the central bank will produce too much money and credit in order to prevent defaults, which will produce a lot of inflation that will make being paid back in devalued money a big risk for the lender-creditor. When this happens, I view it as a red flag, but not a big red flag because history shows that it can happen a lot before the supply and demand imbalance becomes a problem. This started in 2008. It was previously called debt monetization and has this time around been called quantitative easing. In the United States, it came in four waves that added up to $1 8 \%$ of potential GDP, $5 \%$ of total debt, and $1 6 \%$ of government debt. In Europe, it also came in four waves that added up to $30 \%$ of potential GDP, $10 \%$ of total debt, and $3 6 \%$ of government debt. In Japan, it came in three waves that added up to $9 5 \%$ of potential GDP, $2 2 \%$ of total debt, and $4 6 \%$ of government debt.

When central banks buy bonds, they take on the same set of risks that commercial banks and investors take on when they buy bonds. The only difference is that central banks have the powers to print money to monetize them and to account for their losses in ways that make them less apparent.

More specifically, when the central bank buys the bond (say, from a bank), it pays for it by telling the bank it has a new deposit at the central bank. The central bank pays interest on that deposit (not that different from money you or I keep at a bank). Just like commercial banks can get into trouble if the interest they earn on their assets is below the interest they pay on deposits, it’s the same for central banks. If the interest rates the central bank pays on deposits rise above the interest that they are getting on the bonds they own, they will lose money and will have a negative cash flow. If they used mark-to-market accounting, they would have losses on the bonds, and as with banks and investors, if their losses become greater than their capital they have a negative net worth. In reality, at this stage no one cares much, but for reasons that I will explain, they should.

Stage 6: If interest rates rise, the central bank loses money because the interest rate that it has to pay on its liabilities is greater than the interest rate it receives on the debt assets it bought. When that happens, that is notable but not a big red flag until the central bank has a significant negative net worth and is forced to print more money to cover the negative cash flow that it experiences due to less money coming in on its assets than has to go out to service its debt liabilities. That is a big red flag because it signals the central bank’s death spiral (i.e., the dynamic in which the rising interest rates cause problems that creditors see that lead them not to hold the debt assets, which leads to higher interest rates or the need to print more money which devalues the money which leads to more selling of the debt assets and the currency, and so on). That is what I mean when I say the central bank goes broke. I call this going broke because the central bank can’t make its debt service payments, though it doesn’t default on its debts because it prints money. When done in large amounts, that devalues the money and creates inflationary recessions or depressions.

At this stage, the central bank typically ends up in a difficult situation, caught between the need to maintain policy that is at once easy enough to support a weak economy and a fiscally weak government but also tight enough to discourage savers and investors from fleeing the currency. This is a classic hallmark of an unsustainable situation, and it typically manifests in the following ways:

# a) Central banks have losses and negative net worths.

After the central bank has bought a lot of debt and interest rates have risen so debt prices have fallen and the central bank’s short-term costs of funds are greater than the returns on the debt they bought, central banks have big losses that are so big that they lead the central banks to have negative net worths. That is another red flag. Still, all these red flags don’t signal the end of the Big Debt Cycle—they just show signs of the fading financial health of the system. It is not the end because central banks can still print plenty of money to provide ample money and credit and to fund their losses. Having said that, it is noteworthy that in some cases where the governments don’t want to have flimflam finances, the central government is required to put capital in the central bank to recapitalize it. When that happens, the central government has to get more capital to provide it, which will require it to get it by taxing, cutting spending, and/or borrowing which adds to the squeeze.

When central banks buy a lot of debt, that lowers the value of the debt because it lowers the value of the money that the debt asset is promised to get. And when the short-term interest rates that they have to pay are high relative to the long-term interest that they get from the debt assets that they own, they have losses and can have a negative net worth. This is a moderate red flag at first—several central banks have negative net equity (or equivalent) today, and it doesn’t hinder them much in the way of their operations. But at larger degrees of losses, it could begin a spiral that creates much bigger problems.

The advantage of the central banks doing such buying is that 1) it provides credit that wouldn’t have existed to keep interest lower than they would have been and 2) when interest rates rise and the bonds have losses, it will be the central bank that has the losses. This raises the question of whether or not central bank losses matter, and if so why. The answer is that central banks having losses certainly matters less than private sector investors having losses and having to appear to lender-creditors as creditworthy. When central banks have big losses on their debt that signifies a step toward a more advanced stage near the end of the Big Debt Cycle, so I view it as a mid-cycle flag. There is typically still no reason for a crisis at this stage because, as stated, small or moderate losses don’t matter much for the central bank. However, as these losses move from being small to being very large, they can create cash flow needs for the central bank that can only be met with a lot of money printing, which puts a significant downward pressure on the currency, as the central bank runs up a large interest bill on its liabilities (in an effort to keep savers in the currency) but earns little on its assets (in an effort to support the government) and ends up printing the difference. The table below describes historical cases where these cash flow losses became very large and necessitated a big monetization that contributed to a currency spiral:

# b) The central bank is forced to print money to monetize losses on its debt and other debts even though it worsens pressure on the currency.

Faced with these circumstances, the central bank is ultimately forced to print money to monetize its losses and the losses of others. This can happen explicitly through the direct purchase of assets by the central bank or indirectly through guarantees and backstops. The central bank typically takes losses on these assets (often bought at uneconomical prices) through defaults, inflation, and/or rising interest rates—transferring the balance sheet hit from the government to the central bank and the holders of the currency. Some of the hallmarks of this stage are:

An expanding central bank balance sheet as money is printed to finance the government or to roll the debts of other stressed entities. The left chart below shows the central bank’s purchases of government bonds, but it’s worth noting that central bank actions can be much broader than this (up to and including the purchase of private assets like corporate bonds or equities). They can also include measures to guarantee and backstop stressed borrowers that don’t always show up on the balance sheet but still represent some transfer of purchasing power to stressed debtors as the central bank and government are on the hook for covering losses (e.g., Emergency Banking Act of 1933, Bank of Amsterdam’s backstop of the Dutch East India Company—both of which ultimately required monetization).

The sale of reserves as the central bank tries to defend the currency while simultaneously providing money and credit to those that need it. The result is that the composition of the central bank’s asset holdings shifts from hard assets (gold and FX reserves) to soft assets (claims on the government or financials). This contributes to the run on the currency (particularly when the currency is pegged) as investors see the central bank’s resources to defend the currency rapidly decreasing, forcing the central bank to sell reserves even faster until it reaches the point where a defense is no longer feasible. This dynamic is far more pronounced in the fixed rate cases.

The monetization of debts combined with the sale of reserves causes the ratio of the central bank’s hard assets (reserves) to its liabilities (money) to decline, weakening the central bank’s ability to defend the currency. This is another case where having a fixed versus a floating rate case is important. Pegged countries tend to have a more backed money supply but run into problems sooner when the ratio of reserves to money declines. They also tend to expend more reserves in the currency defense stage of the cycle.

# Chapter 7: The Prior Big Debt Crisis Recedes, a New Equilibrium Is Reached, and a New Cycle Can Begin (Stages 7-9)

The cycle ends when a mix of market forces and policy-maker actions create a bottom and an upswing from there. This chapter lays out the dynamics and markers I look for in these times (Stages 7-9 of the archetype I showed in Chapter 4).

Stage 7: Debts are restructured and devalued. When managed in the best possible way (what I call a beautiful deleveraging), the deflationary ways of reducing debt burdens (e.g., through debt restructurings) are balanced with the inflationary ways of reducing debt burdens (e.g., by monetizing them) so that the deleveraging occurs without having unacceptable amounts of either deflation or inflation.

When the debt burdens become too great, a big restructuring and/or devaluation that substantially reduces their size and value will happen, either by itself or with the help of good management.

The currency devalues and the remaining holders of the currency and the debt take big losses in real terms. The loss of purchasing power continues until a new monetary system is established with enough credibility to entice investors and savers to hold the currency again. Typically, this involves a substantial write-down and restructuring of the debt.

Government debts devalue relative to real assets like gold, stocks, and commodities. Perhaps this time, digital currencies like Bitcoin will benefit. The charts below show the average devaluation of currency and debts across the cases relative to 1) gold, 2) commodities, and 3) equities. On average, gold outperforms holding the local debt at equal risk in these cases by roughly $60 \%$ from the start of the devaluation until the currency bottoms. Notice the big difference in what happens in the fixed exchange rate and the variable (fiat) exchange rate cases.

Table shows returns from the moment of devaluation through to the period where the currency has settled at a new equilibrium (i.e., in the USGreat Depression, returns are shown from the month of peg break to shortly after; in cases where the devaluation was more drawn out, returns are shown for the full period of devaluation). We would consider the returns figures in individual cases to more indicative than exact, because getting returns and volatility adjusting is imprecise in cases with market closures, defaults, and in cases where we have lower-quality data.

When debts are restructured and/or devalued, it is typically a terrible time in markets and economies, but this terrible time reduces the debt burdens and establishes the foundation for the improvement. In the archetypical case, debt levels rise significantly relative to the monetary base in the run-up to the crisis, requiring the private sector to absorb a much greater amount of government debt with the same quantity of base money in circulation (which is likely a part of why we see upward pressure on interest rates at first in many of our cases). Eventually, when the pressure becomes too great, the central bank steps in and monetizes the debt, resulting in an expansion of the monetary base and a decline in the debt-to-money ratio.

The ratio of reserves to debt typically falls at first, then rises. Typically, at this stage, we see reserves fall relative to debts—at first because debt levels are increasing quickly, then additionally because reserves are being sold in an attempt to defend the currency. After policy makers give up and let the currency go, we see this ratio improve as the devaluation of the currency mechanically reduces the value of local currency debts relative to hard currency assets and improves the country’s competitiveness, helping it to earn more in hard currency terms.

Government Debt/Money (M0)

The chart below shows how the path of government debts and the monetary base typically line up. Typically, we see government debt rise first (usually in response to some crisis) while money growth is by and large unchanged (and in fact slows at the point of the cycle where the central bank tries to mount a currency defense). The government typically tries to control things through various techniques like foreign exchange controls or managing the currency (e.g., sometimes having an official foreign exchange rate that is different from the market rate). These controls create market distortions and do more harm than good. After the central bank gives up and lets the currency go, the pace of money printing picks up and helps to produce inflation that improves the government’s nominal incomes relative to its debts. This dynamic was by and large similar across pegged and non-pegged cases.

The next three charts show government debt against reserves; the fall in reserves relative to debts is driven mostly by the rise in government debt but also by the selling of reserves late in the cycle to try to fight off the collapse of the currency. After the selling stops and the currency devalues, we typically see an improvement in the ratio as the devaluation lowers the value of local currency government debts relative to any remaining hard currency assets.

Stage 8: At such times, extraordinary policies like extraordinary taxes and capital controls are commonly imposed

At this point, the government is cash-strapped and typically raises taxes to try to meet its financing need. The prospect of greater taxation puts additional pressure on households and businesses to move what they can out of the country. In response, governments often enact capital controls to try to stem these outflows, though at this point the economic pressure to leave the country and currency is too great for governments to stop the bleeding.

The charts below show a few different perspectives on tax rates across cases. You can see, for example, that both marginal income tax rates for top earners and inheritance tax rates rose by about $10 \%$ in the years going into the devaluation.2

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/68b05bf6-0171-4bbd-aaac-dab7b8a958c9/5669bc9ddd1130a72859f61d565d82bd113004ca4a9189127f96fd637423ea42.jpg)

Higher tax rates typically go hand in hand with capital controls in order to try and prohibit money from fleeing the country in response. You can see just how common this was in the table below:

# Stage 9: The deleveraging process inevitably creates a reduction in the debt burdens that creates the return to equilibrium.

Quite often, when there are inflationary depressions so the debt is devalued, at the end of the cycle, government reserves are raised through asset sales, and a strictly enforced transition from a rapidly declining currency to a relatively stable currency is achieved by linking the currency to a hard currency or a hard asset (e.g., gold) by the central bank while having very tight money and a very high real interest rate, which severely penalizes the borrowerdebtors and rewards the lender-creditors, which leads to the buying of the currency/debt which stabilizes the currency/debt.

At this stage, the currency has devalued and the remaining holders of the currency and the debt have taken big losses in real terms, which has relieved a lot of the debt burdens of the debtors. Now, it doesn’t take much to back up the debt, stabilizing it and the currency. When managed well, the government raises reserves, sometimes by selling government-owned assets, sometimes by getting IMF or other loans requiring sound financial policies including austerity. At this stage, the interest rate is still high—in fact very high in relation to the prospective inflation rate and the prospective rate of depreciation in the currency, which means that the central bank can make the debtmoney an attractive investment again, and debt in that currency very expensive, if they manage the situation well. This is when a new and more stable monetary system is established with enough credibility to entice investors and savers to hold the currency again. Typically, this follows a substantial write-down and restructuring of the debt along with a return to some form of hard money (e.g., a peg to gold or another stable currency). And this typically requires a set of fundamental adjustments that improve the country’s balance sheet and income statement.

The five classic steps typically necessary to make the transition are:

1. A restructuring of the country’s debts to manageable levels where reserve assets can cover a substantial portion of liabilities and the government’s debt service no longer exceeds its revenue growth. Typically, defaulting and restructuring foreign currency debts and some local currency debts is required, too.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/68b05bf6-0171-4bbd-aaac-dab7b8a958c9/c193679479f0b56ebfef01d1fe9d3cf63755411b815682914b227d15434fc352.jpg)

The two charts below show an attribution of what has happened to government debt-to-GDP following the devaluation, on average across our case set. You can see below that in the average case, central government debt was at $89 \%$ of GDP around the time of the devaluation. The green bars show the factors that worked to bring the debt-to-GDP ratio down—on average $7 \%$ came from central bank purchases, $3 8 \%$ was due to inflation, $2 6 \%$ was due to positive growth in real GDP, $1 6 \%$ was due to primary surpluses, and $8 \%$ was due to defaults or restructuring of the debt; and the red bar showed what led it to rise— $7 6 \%$ driven by continued interest payments. The net of these is that in the average case, debt falls from $89 \%$ to $70 \%$ of GDP and that rising inflation and rising real growth arising from aggressive stimulations were the big forces behind the debt burden reduction. Said differently, governments that have debt in their own currencies 1) made their interest and principal payments by having their central banks create money and credit, raise inflation, and stimulate real growth, and restructuring debts which raised nominal income growth relative to debt service payments and 2) restructured defaulted debts in the amounts shown. While this chart shows all cases, this was especially true in the cases in which the currencies were denominated in monies that the central banks could produce. In fact, in most cases the debt problems never went away as much as they remained a manageable burden handled in the way described. Of course, these are average numbers and the ranges around them are large, though the patterns are pretty consistent.

2. A deep, painful fiscal policy adjustment to make the country’s finances sustainable without requiring the printing of money to monetize the debt. Making some deep, painful fiscal policy adjustment from the central government and healthy balance of payments adjustments is usually required. It is typical to see a bigger improvement in the primary deficit before the government is able to reduce interest costs by rolling into lower rates.

3. Obtaining sufficient quantities of reserves to defend the currency (or back the new currency if the old, collapsed currency is being replaced) is typically part of the process. The devaluation of the currency typically helps with this both because the fall in the exchange rate increases the value of the country’s reserves relative to its nominal liabilities and because it improves the country’s competitiveness, helping to increase export incomes relative to import costs. In addition, we see a combination of asset sales to build up reserves further and occasionally borrowing from official creditors (which at this point are among the few parties still willing to lend). Also, typically government-owned companies and other assets are sold off at this stage, which brings in money for reserves and improves efficiencies of these businesses.

4. High real interest rates that more than adequately compensate investors for the risks of holding the currency The charts below show the nominal interest rates on local currency and hard currency debts.

5. Placing limits on what the central bank can do that would undermine sustainable finances of the new stable money.

When these conditions are met, it’s among the best times to hold the country’s currency and debt.

That is what the end stages of the typical Big Debt Cycle look like to me. Let’s now return to the very big picture level and look at how that Big Debt Cycle has played out over the last 80 years.


## Part 3: Looking Back

***While in Part 1 I laid out the mechanics of money-credit-debt-markets-economics and in Part 2 I showed the archetypical sequence that led to central governments and central banks to go broke, in this part I show what happened over the last 80 years so that you can see how it aligned with the template and use that review of history as a foundation for looking ahead which will be done in Part 4. I believe that what is covered in this part will give you an interesting and valuable unconventional perspective of what happened and why that will be a foundation for thinking about what will happen. It will certainly provide you food for thought and debate.***

### Chapter 8: An Overview of What Has Happened Since 1944

**I will now look at what happened over the 80 years since 1944, which is when the new world order and the new monetary order came into existence. Regarding the five big forces, while my focus will primarily be on 1) the debt/money/economic force, I will also describe 2) the internal order and political cycle that goes with it (i.e., the political left versus political right cycle), 3) the international order and geopolitical cycle that goes with it (i.e., the great powers conflicts), 4) the acts of nature forces (droughts, floods, and pandemics), and 5) humanity’s advances, especially through technology, because these forces are so intertwined that they can’t be understood separately. I urge you to observe how they together produced the big swings and evolutionary changes that took us from 1944 until now.**

**Of course, this is a very brief description of what happened in a limited number of countries with an emphasis on the most important developments in the countries that were “important” in shaping the changes in the world monetary and geopolitical order. Because US money, credit/debt and other forces were so dominant, naturally the US and its money and credit played the biggest role in shaping this period, hence also in shaping my description of this period. Still, these same five forces were the major forces that drove what happened in all countries in the same basic ways.\[1\]**

**Once again, if you don’t want to read all that I have here and instead want to skim it, I suggest that you just read what is in bold.**

**The Past Is Prologue: How to Look at It**

**To begin, I want to share two of my principles with you that are relevant to how I am approaching this study.**

- ***If you want to see how and why big events have unfolded, be careful not to focus precisely on small events and not to lose sight of how and why the big things are changing. People who try to see things up close and precisely typically miss the most important things because they are preoccupied with looking for precision. Also, if you look at things up close, you will never see the most important big things. So, when looking for the big things, pay attention to the big things.***
- ***Everything that happens does so for reasons that make it happen, so we should strive to understand and explain the cause/effect relationships that drive changes and create from them a logical template-model that both explains past changes and aligns the template-model with what is actually happening and, if there are discrepancies, work to understand and resolve them. This template-model should be timeless and universal, meaning that it should explain all the big important developments in all time frames and in all countries, though not necessarily precisely or in detail. If it fails to explain all the big developments in all time frames and countries, that indicates that an important influence is missing and needs to be added to the model.***

**What I am saying is that in the most fundamental ways, the previously described processes and cycles have happened in all countries over all time similarly, though none of them have been exactly the same. So, to see the processes and cycles, you need to pay attention to the biggest, most important changes that happened, keeping in mind the reasons for the big changes and the big differences.**

**In one sentence what I am saying is that what has timelessly and universally (i.e., throughout the millennia and across countries) driven the Big Debt Cycle changes and has created the big debt and economic problems is the creation of unsustainably large amounts of debt assets and debt liabilities relative to the amounts of money, goods, services, and investment assets in existence.****This always has and inevitably will always lead to big debt crises and “runs” on banks. By a “run” I mean a turning in of debt assets (that have no intrinsic value—i.e., their only value is to buy things) to “banks” in order to get real money, which the bank doesn’t have enough of to meet the demand, so the bank either defaults, or in the case of central banks with fiat monetary systems, “prints” fiat money. Classically, when the holders of those financial assets actually try to convert them back into money and buy things and see that they can’t get the buying power they believe they have stored in their debt assets, the run accelerates which causes the “run on the bank” that feeds on itself which causes great shifts in markets’ values and wealth until debts are defaulted on, restructured and/or monetized, reducing the debt burdens relative to incomes, and a new equilibrium is reached. The debts are almost always monetized, by which I mean that it is almost always the case that the central bank creates a lot of money and credit to make it easier to pay back the debt, which devalues the money and debt.**

**There are variations in how each of these cases plays out. However, during these times, we almost always see that it becomes relatively undesirable to hold the debt assets (i.e., bonds) for long relative to holding other storeholds, such as equities and gold, which don’t lose buying power when the value of money goes down.\[2\]**

You could miss this if you pay too much attention to exactly how banks and central banks have worked, especially if you don’t look at them over time or across countries. For example, while it’s true that long ago there weren’t central banks like there are today, central banks work in essentially the same way as non-central banks except central banks can print money. So, the debt dynamic with them works essentially the same way for central banks as private banks except that, when there is a debt crisis.md), the central banks can print money. Similarly, while the debt dynamic works essentially the same way across countries, in countries that have well-established reserve currencies, the borrowers and lenders are more inclined to have confidence in them so there is more stability. To see how the debt dynamic works, it would also be a mistake to overly focus on how it is now working without keeping in mind how the debt cycle evolves over time. For example, if I didn’t know how central banks (especially the Fed) used quantitative easing when they needed to ease and interest rates hit 0%, even though that never happened before in my lifetime, I wouldn’t have known what they could do and did in 2008. Similarly, throughout history, most central banks have switched from having a linked/backed currency (e.g., a gold-backed currency) to having a fiat currency (allowing them to freely create money) when they had too many debt assets and liabilities relative to the currency it was supposed to be backed by, and they have tended to switch back to a fixed/linked currency when they abused the fiat currency system by printing too much currency, which created too much depreciation of its value for it to be an effective storehold of wealth. I am confident that to understand what is happening and what is likely to happen, you must keep in mind the big changes that happened in history and the cause/effect relationships that drove them—i.e., you must understand how “the machine” works—and not get hung up with trying to be precise with the little stuff or focusing too exactly on what is happening now.

To emphasize the importance of the big things, I describe things in a simplified way, so it’s easy for some people to say, “That’s not exactly right!” and be correct. I am intentionally conveying this template-model in a not exact way in order to draw attention to the most important things.

While I will now explain how I believe the cyclical debt/money/economic dynamic that I previously described has transpired since it began in 1944, I want to re-emphasize that this dynamic isn’t specific to the last 80 years. The big cycle dynamic that I am describing, and that we are now in, is working in the same basic way as past cycles have worked for thousands of years in all countries—i.e., it has been driven by the same basic and logical cause/effect relationships that you will see if you don’t squint at the details.

Let’s now look at what happened since the end of World War II when the new world order began. While I will be putting what happened in the context of the Big Debt Cycle, you will see that the other four forces also swung greatly and interacted with the debt cycles to shape what happened. You will see all five forces ebb and flow like waves, sometimes small ones and sometimes big ones, sometimes reinforcing each other and sometimes negating each other, and sometimes with big ones coming together to create perfect storms. As for the debt cycle force, to repeat, the main thing to keep in mind is:

- ***Normally, when central banks want to be stimulative, they lower interest rates and/or create a lot more money and credit, which creates a lot more spending and debt. This stimulation both extends the expansion phase of the cycle and raises debt assets and liabilities relative to incomes, which makes the debt asset and debt liability balance more precarious. History shows us that when central banks can’t lower interest rates anymore and want to be stimulative, they print money and buy debt, especially government debt. That gives debtors, most importantly governments, money and credit to prevent them from defaulting and allows them to continue to borrow to spend more than they are earning until the debt assets and liabilities become too great to balance, which is when a debt restructuring and/or debt monetization must occur.***

**What Happened Since 1944**

**I am now going to take you through the Big Debt Cycle that began in 1944, which we are now in the late stages of, and explain how it transpired as a function of the earlier described mechanical cause/effect relationships.**

**In reviewing what happened relative to this template, I will go beyond the major debt/money/economic events to include the major events that arose from the other four big forces because all of these five forces were so entwined that it is impossible see them separately. As we go through this period to the present, please note the big swings in all five of these influences and how they affected each other.**

**To make clear how it transpired relative to the previously explained money/debt template, I will divide the post-1944 period into four phases signifying the four main monetary regimes that drove the credit-debt dynamic since 1944. We will begin in 1944 because that is when the new monetary, geopolitical, and in many cases, domestic political orders began.**

Because I was born in 1949 and have been a global macro investor for most of my life, I both experienced and studied most of what I am going to describe, so I am going to share some personal descriptions to help enrich the picture and pass along some lessons that I learned from going through these experiences, especially through my painful mistakes, which stick in my mind much more than my winning decisions. As you watch the story of the last 80 years unfold, observe the almost in-unison swings in the five forces from one extreme to another. Note that they were so extreme that each decade was more likely to be more opposite than similar to the decade before it, yet at the end of each, the psychology and markets expected more of the same, so those were the key times to understand the fundamentals well and bet against the crowd on the unexpected developments that were logically probable.

**The Current Big Debt Cycle in Brief**

**Before I get into what happened, I’d like to show you the Big Debt Cycle in few charts, starting at 1900 with the United States. Showing this whole 1900 period will give you a greater perspective. I have focused on the US dollar debt charts because the world money and debt market has been a US dollar debt market during this Big Cycle, even though it is the case that other countries have also had their own big cycles.**

**In the US, from 1944 to 2024 there were 12.5 short-term debt cycles (i.e., at this writing we are about halfway through the 13th) that averaged about six years in length and added up to one Big Debt Cycle that brought the central government’s debt-to-income ratios up and worsened the central bank’s balance sheet in the ways shown in the charts below.**Said differently, the US and its credit markets have been in the long-term leveraging-up phase of the long-term debt cycle, and they haven’t yet entered the deleveraging part of the long-term debt cycle, though there have been some brief deleveragings along the way. These charts show the big picture. Most people overlook this big-picture arc because they are focused on the short-term wiggles, which don’t even show up in these charts.

**This first chart shows US private debt relative to GDP since 1900. This Big Debt Cycle beginning in 1944 is obvious. Note the peak in 2008 and the slight decline since then. The decline happened as the US central government and US central bank stepped in in a big way to help the private sector, which is shown in the next two charts. As previously explained, this is typical of the beginning of the late stage of the Big Cycle.**

**The chart below shows US government debt relative to GDP, with the dots signifying projections by the Congressional Budget Office in 10 and 20 years. As shown, it is evolving in a big cycle, is now at the highest level since 1946 (around the end of World War II), and is projected to be much higher in the future.**

![](Attachments/1738242243387.png)

**Now I will put the last two charts into one chart so you can see how they relate to each other. You can see how private and public sector debt levels have been related: most importantly how the government tended to acquire more debt when the private sector was acquiring less.**For example, you can see how the government’s debt as a share of GDP has increased dramatically since 2008, while the private sector’s debt-to-GDP went down. That is because in order to provide the private sector with more support, the central government got itself into more debt. Therein lies the problem.

![](Attachments/1738242279515.png)

The next chart shows the central government debt service as a percent of the money it takes in. As shown, it is now at about 100% and it is projected to rise to about 150% in 15 years. To visualize what that means, imagine that the amount of money you had to pay in debt service each year was 50% greater than you earned each year. It’s unimaginable. So, what is the belief that is behind how that situation will work? It is the belief that the government will be able to 1) roll over the debt that is coming due, 2) sell the new debt that it needs to borrow to fund the deficit, and 3) have holders of the existing debt not sell it (i.e., that those who are lending to the government decide that they want to continue lending to the government because it’s not too risky).

***Because everything that happens does so because of reasons that make it happen, if one looks and thinks about them, one can see indicators of the cause/effect relationships, see them unfolding, and use them as indicators of what is likely to happen.*****To help paint the picture I will pass along a few more of these.**

**The next chart shows the 10-year Treasury bond rate and a three-year moving average of the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate.*****The relationship between interest rates and inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rates is important because when interest rates are high relative to the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate there is an incentive to save and earn the interest rate, and when interest rates are low relative to the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate there is an incentive to borrow and hold assets that benefit from inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and the growth that low interest rates foster.***

In the chart below, you can see the big cycles of interest rates reflected in the 10-year Treasury bond yield and a three-year moving average of the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate. The bond yield consists of two parts—the expected inflation rate and the expected real bond yield. Both are important in affecting the value of money and debt as a storehold of wealth and as a cost of funds. Note that on the upswing of this big cycle, all short-term cyclical swings in bond yields (i.e., those that took place in the cycles of recessions, stimulations, strong growth, and rising inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) periods that led to tightening money and credit that then led to recessions and falling bond yields) and all the cyclical declines in bond yields were higher than the ones before them until 1981. Also note that each of the short-term cyclical swings in bond yields from 1981 until 2020 were lower than the ones before until nominal interest rates nearly hit 0% and real interest rates were significantly negative. That reflects the big cycle in inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) expectations and the real interest rates’ movements around these expectations. While nominal interest rates are important, real interest rates are even more important because that is an indicator of the attractiveness of Treasury bonds as a storehold of wealth.

![](Attachments/1738242365591.png)

In the chart below you can see the real 10-year bond yield. In years after 1997, I am using the real yield on a 10-year Treasury inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-protected bond.\[3\] In my opinion, the real bond yield is the most important number to watch in the financial world. That is because it shows what real return you can certainly get (i.e., free of inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) risk and default risk) on your wealth,\[4\] which is the most foundational rate for all capital markets. To earn more than that rate, one has to earn it through cleverness. Even more importantly,**it is the best single indicator of whether it is better to be a borrower-debtor or a lender-creditor** —e.g., when real interest rates are low, it is much easier to borrow money and convert it into profits than when real interest rates are high. As such, it is a great tool for central banks to use to modulate credit and economic activity. As shown, the real bond yield has averaged about 2% over the last 100 years, which is a rate that is neither too low for borrower-debtors nor too high for lender-creditors. The period of great differences from this 2% were periods of excessively cheap or excessively expensive credit/debt that contributed greatly to the big swings in the Big Debt Cycle.

![](Attachments/1738242396220.png)

When looking at nominal bond yields relative to inflation-indexed bonds’ real yields, I can also see the breakeven inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate, which is the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate that the market is betting on. Since one can make money betting against that rate if one thinks inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) is higher or lower than the market believes, and the markets are pretty tough to beat, one can use that inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate as a pretty good naïve estimate if one doesn’t have a market-beating way to make a better estimate. Because I can see in the market pricing both the “discounted” (i.e., market expected) inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate and the discounted real interest rate that I can lock in, I see the bond yield and price as consisting of these two important drivers. I am always watching them rather than just the Treasury bond interest rate, and I often think of and trade the two pieces—i.e., the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate and the real interest rate—separately. Their past estimated pricing is shown below.

![](Attachments/1738242420319.png)

**I always think about the 10-year real rate and its two parts because it is the most important governor of all capital markets.**I have been intimately involved with it for a long time. For several years, when there wasn’t an inflation-indexed bond market in the US, I invested in non-US inflation-indexed bonds that I currency-hedged to create a synthetic equivalent of a US inflation-indexed bond. That came about because a great investor, David White of the Rockefeller Foundation, explained that he had to give away 5% a year and asked me what I thought was the surest way of investing to fund that, which prompted me to think about leveraging and hedging foreign inflation-indexed bonds. That led Bridgewater to become the largest global inflation-indexed bond manager in the world, and I was invited to work on the design of the Treasury Inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) Protected (TIPS) bond market with Larry Summers when he ran the US Treasury. Since then, we have had a real market showing real bond yields to both look at for guidance and to invest in, which has been foundational to all my investment thinking. I believe that the inflation-indexed bond markets that exist around the world are much underappreciated and underused relative to their potential, for the reasons I just explained. I recommend that you watch them as indicators and use them as storeholds of wealth.

***The relationship between short-term rates and long-term rates (i.e., the yield curve) is also very important because when short-term interest rates are high relative to long-term rates that indicates money is tight and encourages the holding and lending of cash, which becomes more attractive than borrowing and investing in other investments.***Movements in the attractiveness of different assets affect the nominal interest rate yield curve—i.e., the difference between the 10-year nominal bond yield and the nominal short rate\[5\]—reflecting the changing tightness of money and the changing incentives to hold cash relative to bonds.\[6\] That is because normally a higher interest rate is required by lender-creditors to hold longer-term debt and because higher long-term interest rates than cash rates provide a reward-inducement for lending. When the central bank wants to slow credit growth and economic demand it raises short-term rates relative to long-term rates, and when it wants to stimulate it does the opposite. When both 1) real yields are high and 2) the yield curve is nearly flat or inverted, money and credit are tight, which is typically a good environment for lender-creditors and a bad environment for borrower-debtors, and when 3) real yields are low and 4) the yield curve is relatively positive, that is typically a good environment for borrower-debtors and a bad environment for lender-creditors. When central banks shift these things extremely that leads to extremely good and bad environments and a lot of volatility for both borrower-debtors and lender-creditors, which is also disruptive to economies and causes pain and inefficiencies.

**I think that the Fed should not be as extreme and volatile as it has been in its use of interest rates to influence monetary policy.****If I were running monetary policy, my goal would be to keep the long-term real interest rate relatively stable at a rate that balances the needs of both borrower-debtors and lender-creditors and doesn’t contribute to making the debt bubbles and busts. That would mean seeking to have the real T-bond yield around 2%, varying that target by something like 1%, and targeting the yield curve slope so that a) the short-term rate is about 1% below the long-term rate and b) the short-term rate divided by the long-term rate is about 70%, give or take about 2% and about 50% respectively.**

![](Attachments/1738242454534.png)

**Setting policy in a way that produces fewer big and volatile swings in real interest rates and yield curves would lead to less volatility. In turn, that would lead to less harm to borrower-debtors and lender-creditors (and everything else they affect in the economy), and it would allow them to plan better.**In other words, with a more consistent policy, borrower-debtors and lender-creditors would both know that they could expect a reasonable real rate, which should be acceptable to both of them so they could plan their activities accordingly. With that relatively certain borrowing rate, lending and economic conditions.md) would adapt to that reasonable interest rate. Also, setting that rate would help provide both borrowers and lenders more stable cost-of-funds and real returns, which would make for more stable capital markets and yield more stable economic conditions.md), which would improve efficiencies that would enhance the running of capital markets and the economy.But let’s get back to exploring rates and how they impact the economy.

**Thus far I have just shown you the big picture of the Treasury interest rate, but that isn’t the rate that people, companies, and local governments borrow at. For that reason, watching credit spreads is helpful. Below is a chart that shows an average credit spread (for Baa corporate bonds) since 1920.**

![](Attachments/1738242491409.png)

**The amount of interest owed on a debt is determined by the amount borrowed and the interest rate, which, together with the amount of principal to be paid back, is the amount of debt service.**

**Let’s revisit the chart shared earlier that shows total debt service (principal payments plus interest payments) for the US central government relative to its revenues and how much of that comes from principal payments and how much comes from interest payments.**Note that debt service was roughly flat from 1950 to 2000; that is because government debt levels were roughly flat or falling slightly over that period, so principal payments were also roughly flat to slightly falling. Interest payments rose slightly from 1950 to 1990, as the average interest rate on government debt slowly rose, then fell from 1990 to roughly 2022, as the average interest rate on government debt slowly fell.

I am using dots to show how this is projected to grow, based on the CBO’s estimates, over the next 10 and 20 years. The projected picture is very different from the recent past, because the central government’s debt levels are high and projected to rise fast, and the effective interest rate on these high debts is also projected to rise, which will cause a big increase in government debt service relative to government revenue, which produces a significant squeeze on spending unless there is a lot more borrowing, most likely financed by the central bank. Therein lies the problem.

![](Attachments/1738242523456.png)

Who did the central government borrow the money from? It borrowed a lot of it from the central bank. It also borrowed a lot from commercial banks and foreign investors who lost money when interest rates rose. About one-third of it is from foreigners. These commercial and foreign buyers/holders of US debt have had losses in it as interest rates rose, and they have more of it as a percentage of their holdings than makes sense on a financial basis alone. In the case of the biggest foreign holders of US government bonds, they have so much because they want to store buying power in the most widely used and accepted currency of the greatest and most credible world power—said differently, because it is the leading reserve currency of the leading world power. Looking ahead, given that increased supply of US government dollar debt that is coming (as shown in the last chart) relative to the desired demand for it, it is hard to imagine that these big buyers/holders are likely in the future to buy the huge amounts of US Treasuries that they did in the past, especially if any of the key underpinnings of that demand weaken—e.g., the US government a) irresponsibly handles its debt and its domestic and foreign policy issues, b) if the US government threatens to sanction them by withholding payments of the debt, c) if the returns from holding this debt are bad, and/or d) the US loses its economic and geopolitical prominence.

As US debt service levels kept rising, debtors needed lower levels of interest rates to make debt service affordable. From 1980 until 2008, lowering interest rates was more than enough to keep debt service affordable even as debt levels kept rising. But **when rates nearly hit zero in 2008, as they did in the post-1933 period, private market demand for the bonds was inadequate to meet the supply so the central bank stepped in with money printing and buying the bonds, which put downward pressure on longer-term rates. It happened in two major waves—one in response to the 1929-33 debt-crisis-induced Great Depression when interest rates hit 0%, so in the post-1933 period, and again in response to the 2008 debt-crisis-induced Great Recession when interest rates hit 0%, so in the post-2008 period.**I wouldn’t have known that, and Bridgewater wouldn’t have been successful in this period if we hadn’t studied the timeframe shown in this chart. This is also what led to my first discovery of how the Big Debt Cycle works.

![](Attachments/1738242562382.png)

**As for the central bank,****the Federal Reserve and other central banks’ debt assets provide lower returns than the costs required to service their liabilities, so the modest rise in the interest rate that has occurred in this most recent tightening has caused the Fed to take modest operating losses (blue line below).**If the bonds on the Fed balance sheet were marked to market, its losses would be around $700 billion, or 2.5% of GDP (red line). This sounds significant but is relatively minor versus the central bank’s capacity to obtain funding. However, it is a red flag and would become a major problem if there was a big selling of US debt, which is what typically happens when that debt is perceived as a risky asset. As previously explained, for countries like the United States that have the ability to print their own money, that would lead to either a) a big and intolerable rise in nominal and real interest rates, which would contract credit and lead to a severe economic contraction, or b) a big central bank printing of money and buying of debt and providing of credit, which would lead to the devaluation of debt and money. The big central bank losses and bad conditions would also increase the likelihood that the central bank’s independence would be called into question. For those countries that have debt denominated in a reserve currency that is not theirs, conditions would be much worse.

**Debt Burdens Will Increase Globally**

In this introduction, I focused on the debt picture for the US. You can see below that this is not only an American issue. Debt burdens are projected to grow substantially across the developed world (excluding Germany) over the coming decades. It is crucial to understand how these dynamics will play out in order to understand how to make policy and trade in markets through these coming decades.

**To reiterate, I am going to take you through the Big Debt Cycle for the US because the US dollar was and still is the dominant reserve currency that most transactions were and are denominated in and most savings are in. However, in this chapter you will see the Big Debt Cycles of several countries unfold. In Chapter 14, I will dive more deeply into the Japanese Big Debt Cycle. To me, the US over the last 70-80 years, Japan after its bubble bursting, and the other cases I have looked at are all classic Big Debt Cycles that are operating in the previously described ways that are important for investors and policy makers in all countries to understand now that some of them are encountering Big Debt Cycles in their own countries and they will likely experience serious consequences from those in the US and the US dollar assets and liabilities. While reading this chapter, note the interactions of these debt cycles with the political, geopolitical, nature acts, and technology forces.**

**To reiterate, I think that there are short-term money/credit/debt/economic cycles that add up to long-term money/credit/debt/economic cycles that cause swings around uptrends in productivity that are due to humanity’s inventiveness especially of new technology so, figuratively speaking, it looks like this to me.**

We will now look at what happened through the phases of the long-term debt cycle.

### Chapter 9: The History and Lessons from Phase 1, from 1944 to 1971—A Linked (i.e., Hard) Monetary System (MP1)

**This type of monetary system, which I call Monetary Policy 1,\[7\] is one in which the currency can be used to buy a designated hard asset (most often gold) at a set price, and, because of that ability, the supply of the currency is supposedly limited. That is because if the supply of the currency becomes too large, its price should fall. This would lead people to take their money to buy the item the currency is backed by (e.g., the gold), which will lead to the currency being turned in, so taken out of supply, thus supporting the value of money. The problem with this system is that it has never worked in the long term because, even with the link to a hard asset, governments still issue more debt than they should, which leads to many more claims on the asset than the money is convertible into (e.g., gold) than can be converted at the specified price. The consequences of this are almost always a “run on the bank,” with people rushing to make the conversion, and the breaking of the promise to deliver the hard asset.**

**From 1944 to 1971 there was a gold-linked monetary system in which dollars, which at the time were considered like checks with no intrinsic value, were exchangeable for gold, which was considered the real money, at a fixed exchange rate. Other currencies were exchangeable for dollars at agreed-upon and changeable rates.**

During this 27-year period, there were five short-term debt/economic cycles, which were wiggles around an uptrend in debt relative to incomes during this period. In brief, here is what happened, including what happened with all five of the big forces.

World War II ended the prior world order and caused the transition to the new world order that we are now in. As always, the biggest winners of the war—in this case, the US, Great Britain, and their allies as well as the Soviet Union and its allies—determined the rules of the new world order including the new world monetary system.**In 1944 the US, Great Britain, and their allies created what would be the new monetary system**, which was called the Bretton Woods monetary system (because it was created in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire). It looked like most prior monetary systems that existed throughout the millennia **with “paper” money being linked to the real money (gold), which was held in banks (in this case, central banks)**, though it had its own particular characteristics, as they all did. In this case, because the US had about two-thirds of the world’s gold,\[8\] which was held by the US Treasury, the dollar became the world’s reserve currency. Other countries had their own currencies, so to get gold from the US central bank, they had to buy dollars and then use those dollars to buy the gold. Only countries’ central banks were allowed to buy gold; individuals were prohibited from buying gold with their paper money. In fact, in the US and most other countries, it was illegal for citizens to own gold because governments wanted people to save in debt assets in order to build the credit system and they didn’t want debt assets to have to compete with gold. This system was created for the United States and countries that wanted to join it, and the US wanted to let others in. Great Britain became a subordinate power in this new order because its financial and other powers were weakened by the war, while the United States became much richer because it entered the war late. The Soviet Union had its own monetary system, and ways of doing things that were independent of the US-dominated system.

**The main geopolitical competition was between the US (which was a capitalist democracy) and the Soviet Union (which was a communist autocracy).**The United States was much stronger economically and militarily than the Soviet Union, so it was able to provide financial support programs like the Marshall Plan to help build its allies, especially in Europe. These programs were done to enhance alliances, which was especially important at a time of the Cold War. Because the US was rich (it had two-thirds of the world’s gold which was money at the time), had the world’s reserve currency, and accounted for about half of world GDP, it could easily afford to provide this support to allies. Having the world’s reserve currency, which other countries wanted, gave it great buying power that it abused.

**At that time, China, which was allied with the winning powers against the Japanese in the war, was a destroyed and powerless country having suffered what it calls the “Century of Humiliation,” in which foreign countries took over different parts of China, conditions deteriorated terribly, and the whole system of government collapsed.**This roughly 100-year period began in 1839 and ended with the end of World War II. During this period, Japan took over Taiwan in 1895, which was given back to China by the winning powers at the end of the war.**Between 1945 and 1949, China had its version of a classic civil war between hard-right capitalists and the hard-left communists. That led to the communists driving the capitalists out to Taiwan, Chinese communists siding with Russian communists, and the United States alienating China. At that time and since, it was agreed that there was only one China and Taiwan is part of China, and the argument was over who controlled Taiwan and China. Arguments about this issue have festered for a long time and are intensifying, which is especially important because of the powers the US and China have and because Taiwan is the center of chip production, which today is even more important than oil production was in the last cycle.**

**In that early post-war period, inventive people, especially American scientists and entrepreneurs who were primarily financed by the capitalists with government support, continued to come up with great new technology that would eventually have huge effects.**For example, in 1956 “artificial intelligence” and the personal computer were invented, and in 1957 the satellite was invented. In the mid-1950s the technical foundations of the internet were developed. Of course, there were too many inventions that had big economic, political, geopolitical, and environmental effects for me to delve into here.

**Because Great Britain was heavily indebted and in fast relative decline economically and militarily, it rapidly and persistently had its bonds and money devalued in the classic ways that were described earlier and that are important to keep in mind when looking at the US now.**Immediately after the war, Britain had a lot of debt, and it had colonies and military bases in over 40 countries that it couldn’t afford to maintain.I won’t repeat all the steps, but I will point out that this overextended British Empire had debt problems that led to a managed 30% devaluation of its currency in 1949, which was followed by a series of devaluations in the years that followed, all to relieve its debt burdens at the great cost of its debt holders. The decline in the value of the currency and debt was classic. There were debt payment problems and the inevitable losses of the controlled foreign territories that made it obvious to the world that Great Britain was declining, which reinforced the desire not to hold its debt and currency and led to their further declines. Most obviously, when Egypt took over the Suez Canal in 1956, loyal holders of Great Britain’s bonds sold them. In 1967, another financial crisis led to another major devaluation and abandonment of its debt and money being held as a storehold of wealth, and in 1976 Britain’s financial condition got so bad that it had to go to the IMF for financial help. The decline of the British pound and Britain is the most recent classic case study of the decline of a reserve currency, which is described at length in my book *Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order*.

**In the early 1960s, the US short-term money and credit cycle was expansionary, which was great for the US markets and economy until 1965-66 when inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rose to 3.8% and the Fed tightened monetary policy, inverting the yield curve for the first time since 1929 and leading to a recession in 1969-70. That produced, in 1968, what would be the peak inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-adjusted price in the S&P 500 for the next 25 years, with that long period of bad performance due to the big cycle influences I described earlier in this study.**That long period of terrible stock and bond market performance and terrific gold and other inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-hedge assets performance was primarily due to the needed creation and devaluation of money to deal with the debts (i.e., the debtors’ obligations to deliver money) being too large relative to the actual amount of real money in existence. That paradigm taught me a lot about the need to be able to make money in all types of market environments and the skills required to do it. It also puts me today in a very different mindset from most investors who haven’t been through something like that and have views based just on their experiences and so think that being long just in equity-like assets and ignoring the big cycles is the best way to invest.

**In the 1960s, there were also some nail-biting political and geopolitical conflicts that made a big impression on me, most notably when the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 brought the world’s two most powerful countries to the brink of nuclear war.**I was 13 at the time and vividly remember watching John F. Kennedy’s address to the country explaining the situation and wondering if there would be nuclear war or which country would back down. Cuba’s leader, Fidel Castro, wanted to go to war, which could have been a nuclear war. The stock market didn’t behave nearly as badly as I thought it would have. What happened was that the Soviet Union pulled its missiles, which were aimed at the US, out of Cuba, and the United States pulled its missiles that were aimed at the Soviet Union out of Turkey. This allowed both countries to claim victory without telling their people about their concessions made, and I got my first lesson about how brinkmanship diplomacy really works and how markets behave during such dramas (when the damages that would result from the conflict are unacceptably high). In November 1963, JFK was assassinated, which also had only a brief passing effect on the markets and economy; there was the civil rights movement; and big spending on “guns” (the Vietnam War) and “butter” (US domestic social programs). These and numerous other seemingly earthshaking events that didn’t have much effect on markets helped me to realize why they didn’t affect the markets more and sort out what really matters and doesn’t matter to market prices and the economy. While I won’t delve into all that matters, I will tell you that what matters to markets is the money that investments earn, so big political events like threats of war don’t matter much until they start to affect those cash flows. That is why, from an investment perspective, I don’t worry about the headline-grabbing events of today that don’t matter much and suggest that you do the same. Also, I learned that most of these global threats turn out to sound more threatening than they actually are because most countries’ leaders will step back from the brink rather than choose to go over it. However, to be clear, there are times that international conflicts have impacts, such as on supply lines and the value of currencies, and there are rare occasions when leaders don’t step back and things blow up, so that these conflicts become very consequential. Because I view protecting myself against these events as being like buying insurance to be protected against an improbable, unacceptable loss, I look for ways to be insured against them even though I don’t expect them to happen.

**In the 1960s, there was also a big geopolitical swing in the relationship between China and the Soviet Union. They changed from being “friendly” countries to becoming “enemy” countries, which led to a corresponding big geopolitical swing between China and the United States** **from being “enemies” to “friends.”** That led to Henry Kissinger’s secret visit to China in 1971 and then Nixon’s visit in early 1972, which set the stage for China’s opening up after Mao Zedong died in 1976. These developments, like the earlier mentioned technology developments, were like small seeds of change being planted that grew into enormous changes that would affect all five forces everywhere. They mattered a lot even though they didn’t seem to matter much at the time.

During this 1945-70 period, the US overspent and financed that overspending by borrowing, especially **in the 1960s on the Vietnam War and the “war on poverty,” so its paper-money promises to give real money (gold) far exceeded what it had in its bank. That mattered a lot, though it didn’t seem to at the time because the bad finances grew slowly until they led to the blow-up. You see, early in the 1950s and 1960s, most countries were happy to accept these “paper” dollars in return for their goods and services because they wanted to accumulate dollars as savings. As a result, the US could overspend liberally. Also, over those years other countries, especially Germany and Japan, gradually recovered from their big losses from the war and became competitive economically, which led the US balance of payments to worsen. In the late 1960s period, one could see the US and the UK having bank runs on their central banks because holders of paper money turned it in to get the real money (gold), so the US central bank’s reserves of gold steadily declined.**

Seeing the US central bank running out of the real money (gold), Charles de Gaulle, the French president at the time, in 1965 openly called for a reform of the monetary system. Other holders of paper dollars caught on and the run accelerated and the US spending and deficits didn’t slow down, so the run on the US central bank ended like most such central bank runs end. For previously described reasons, the selling of the debt drove interest rates up and the currency down at the same time as the economy weakened.**The US central bank** **did not have enough real money (gold) in the bank to meet its obligations to exchange it for the paper money at the promised price.**

**On the night of Sunday, August 15, 1971, President Nixon got on the television and announced that the United States was no longer going to allow dollar holders to turn their dollars in for gold. That ended the monetary system, and money, as we knew it. It immediately devalued money, raised inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), and made it much easier to pay debts for the reasons I previously explained.**I was clerking on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the time. It was a summer job between college and business school. I figured that ending the money system as we knew it and preventing people from getting the real money was a big, bad deal, so I expected the stock market to be down a lot. Instead, it was the best day for the market that year—stocks were up more than 3% on Monday. Because I had never experienced a currency devaluation before, I was ignorant about how they worked. That led me to study history, which led me to find out that, in 1933, President Roosevelt had done the exact same thing (default on the promise to allow people with dollars to exchange them for gold at the promised exchange rate) for the exact same reason (the US created more promises for gold than it had in gold, and it was running out of gold and money during a bank run), which had the exact same effect (the devaluation, big market rallies in stocks and gold). The only real difference from Nixon was that Roosevelt made the announcement on the radio, not television, which wasn’t around yet. In both cases, delinking the currency meant the central government didn’t have to deliver the real money and freed themselves to create a lot of money and credit. This made it easier to have the debts and stimulate the economy, leading equities, gold, and commodity prices to rise and the economy to pick up. That’s when I learned that when central banks create a lot of money and credit, the value of money and credit goes down and the price of most things goes up. I realized that these moves were classic cases of “hard” currency (gold-linked) exchange rate systems breaking down, leading to the devaluations of the money and debt. Once I saw this happen in these two cases, I saw that it happened throughout history in almost all such cases, and I learned the principle that ***when there is a big debt problem that is intolerably painful, central banks will “print money” and distribute it to make it easier for debtors to pay their debts, which will devalue the money and debt relative to other assets****.*That helped me make a lot of money and avoid a lot of painful losses.

### Chapter 10: The History and Lessons from Phase 2, 1971 to 2008—A Fiat Money, Interest-Rate-Driven Monetary Policy (MP2)

**The August 1971 breakdown of the monetary system changed the value of money and how the system worked—i.e.,****the gold-linked system was replaced by a fiat monetary system in which central banks stimulated and restrained money/credit/debt growth by changing interest rates.**I call this type of monetary system (i.e., one in which fiat currencies are managed via interest rate changes) Monetary Policy 2 (MP2).\[9\] I make these distinctions between types of monetary policy because they work very differently, and it is important to understand these differences. The most important differences between MP1 and MP2 are that a) in an MP2-type monetary system the amount of money and credit provided by lender-creditors to borrower-debtors is primarily driven by the cost of money (i.e., interest rates) and b) is not restrained by the link to hard currency (e.g., to gold). Because the amount of money and credit was unrestrained and because the world’s central banker (the Fed) wanted to accommodate what happened, this changed policy led to a very classic combination of economic stagnation and inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), which was called stagflation.

**From 1971 to 1982: Stagflation and Tightening and the Move from the Political Left to the Political Right**

**From 1971 until the end of 1981, the Federal Reserve increased the supply of money by 100%, and the broader measures of money supply that included some bank accounts and cash instruments (called M2) increased by 180%. The prices of a) goods and services (measured in CPI), b) stocks, and c) gold went up by a) about 140%, b) around 30%, and c) about 10x respectively. Stock prices fell by 45% in real terms. Of course, debtors benefited because they could pay their debts with much more available and much cheaper dollars and creditors suffered because the value of the money they were promised dwindled. In that 10-year period, a holder of 10-year Treasury bonds lost around 40% in inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-adjusted terms, and holders of Baa corporate bonds had slightly negative returns in inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-adjusted terms. In other words, starting in 1971 and through the next few years, the Fed dealt with the debt crisis.md) by creating a lot more money and credit, which created great debt relief for debtors and great losses of buying power for creditors, which encouraged borrowing and discouraged lending.**This decade of debt monetization developments made a big impression on me and taught me some invaluable lessons about the need and ability to make money in all kinds of markets. I think that current investors who have only lived in an environment in which equity-like assets have had positive real returns are approaching investing by only looking to buy equity-like investments to provide great real returns, and that is a mistake.

**The most important difference between today’s US money (i.e., dollars), which has been the most important world money since 1944, and dollars in the 1945-71 period is that today’s money is and has been fiat money since 1971. That has meant, and it still means, that the Fed (which is essentially the world’s central banker because the US dollar is the world’s dominant medium of exchange and storehold of wealth) can more freely create money and credit than in the past. Other central banks can do the same, so this affects all mediums of exchange and storeholds of wealth. For previously explained reasons, doing that is the easiest and most subtle way for governments to alleviate debt burdens and confiscate wealth.**By the way, fiat monetary systems have existed throughout history, so studying those in the past provides invaluable lessons of how they work that can provide clues for how the one we are in will go as the debt cycle progresses.

While the gold-dollar-based system broke down in 1971, the US remained the dominant world power economically, militarily, and in most other respects, and most world trade and capital transactions were done in dollars, so the dollar remained the world’s leading currency that governments, companies, and people wanted to save in despite the fact that it was such a terrible storehold of wealth in the 1970s.

In the 1971-81 period, it paid to be a borrower-debtor because the big devaluation that started in August 1971 had immediate inflationary effects, which were accompanied by big rises in oil and other commodities’ prices and a fiat monetary system that gave central banks the freedom to continue to keep creating credit and keep interest rates low.

The inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) of the 1970s came in two waves driven by two short-term debt cycles and geopolitical shifts. The big easing of monetary policy in 1971 after the delinking with gold got it going. Then,**in 1973, the British Empire and colonialism were breaking down, so there was a big geopolitical shift in the Middle East that led to the first “oil shock” that caused more inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)**. It was mostly a fight about money, as it normally is. More specifically, at that time, the colonized countries of the Middle East (and elsewhere) were overthrowing the colonialists that controlled them and nationalizing the colonialist claims on the assets of the colonized. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and Libya nationalized most of the oil properties that were owned by the “Seven Sisters” (the seven major oil companies), and in October 1973, war broke out between the Arabs and Israelis. These events led to oil prices rising a lot, which led central banks, especially the Federal Reserve, to pursue highly accommodative monetary policy in order to ease the economic pain of rising prices, which allowed more money growth, which produced more inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) in almost everything, especially in commodities and real estate.**Commodity producers, especially in emerging countries, boomed, so naturally dollars from Europe, the US, and elsewhere began to be lent to emerging countries’ commodities producers, which began their debt-financed booms and bubbles, which contributed to the “stagflations” in the US and most of the world.**

In the early 1970s, a lot of dollars were held in other countries, especially in European countries, so there was the growth of what was called the Eurodollar market. Those dollars had to be lent out. Because there was high inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) in the world due to the previously described currency devaluations, commodity prices were high, so it seemed good to lend to commodity-producing emerging countries. That fueled a boom that created a bubble in these countries, with the lender-creditor to them being US, European, and some Japanese banks.

In the 1970s, there were two short-term money/credit/debt/economic cycles that each transpired in classic ways with the Fed’s decisions to ease and tighten monetary policy driving them, though the second money/credit/debt and inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) surge was much bigger than the first.

In the 1971-74 period, money was easy, inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), and economic activity rose, and the oil-exporting countries embargoed oil, which sent oil prices and inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) higher. So, from the end of 1973 to 1974 the Fed tightened money and credit, raising interest rates, inverting the yield curve, which sent the markets and the economy into severe declines. That led to a recession. That completed that short-term debt cycle.

**Then it happened again. Easy money and credit following the recession caused inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and economic activity to pick up and there was a second oil price shock that was due to and caused by internal political and international geopolitical conflicts.**In Iran, the Shah’s domestic order was overthrown, which led to the US embassy being seized and American hostages being held by those who took power. That began the conflict with Iran that remains with us. This development was both inflationary and humiliating for the United States. The charts below show the average interest rate (the average of the 90-day Treasury bill rate and the 10-year Treasury bond rate) and the CPI inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate from 1971 through 1981. As you can see, in the 1970s interest rates rose more slowly than inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rates, so real interest rates were low until they were negative (as low as -4% at certain points, compared to the average up to that point of 2%). These artificially low interest rates relative to inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rates were great for borrower-debtors and terrible for lender-creditors which encouraged borrowing and buying which drove inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rates up and interest rates followed until the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) became so bad that changes had to be made which led to the reverse. You can clearly see the two short-term debt cycles reflected in this chart. The vertical lines in these charts represent January 1980.

In the chart below, you can see a few other flavors of real interest rates.

**At the same time, workers and labor unions had become stronger, which raised wage inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and squeezed company profit. As shown in the chart below, labor’s share of revenue had increased from 68% in 1965 to the US historical high of 74% in 1980. That both reflected and influenced the political cycle that accompanied the debt cycle.**

![](Attachments/1738243045735.png)

**Enough was enough. The combination of high inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), weak dollar, bad economic conditions.md), bad conditions for businesses, and geopolitical crises was intolerable for voters.**

**The debt/money/economic, domestic-political, and international-geopolitical pendulums/orders had swung too far, to their extremes, so big changes were made and conditions were reversed. Pretty much everything changed and moved in the opposite direction. More specifically, in reaction to the uncontrolled inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), Paul Volcker was appointed chair of the Federal Reserve to shift monetary policy from very easy to extremely tight, and in reaction to the generally terrible conditions that occurred under left-leaning governments, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Helmut Kohl and other right-leaning governments gained control.****In other words, there was one of those classic roughly synchronized debt/economic and political swings that typically occurs because the people’s discontentment with their conditions causes discontentment with the country’s leaders and the party in power.**

**When Paul Volcker was appointed as chair of the Federal Reserve in 1979 to fight inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), he severely tightened the supply of money and credit growth**, whichled to the tightest money and the highest level of interest rates “since the birth of Jesus Christ” (according to German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt).

**The chart below shows the CPI inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate (as a simple proxy for inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)), the average of the three-month and the 10-year interest rate (as a simple proxy for interest rates) and the yield curve (the three-month rate minus the 10-year rate—as a simple proxy for the tightness of monetary policy). From these charts, you can see the two short-term credit cycles in the 1970s and you can see the next one emerging in the early 1980s. You can see that money was made very tight money to fight inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) around 1980.**

![](Attachments/1738243081251.png)

**In addition to the monetary tightening, high real rates, and falling inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) there was a shift from liberal to conservative labor policies. Thatcher in the UK, Reagan in the US, and Kohl in Germany (all moderate conservatives) led strong fights against labor inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and labor unions that cut labor’s share of the revenue pie, which reduced inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and raised corporate profits. These conservative leaders also cut taxes on income and corporate profits and pursued tougher geopolitical policies.**

The new Iranian leadership released the hostages exactly as Reagan took office in response to his threat of severe consequences if they didn’t. Thatcher went to war with Argentina and won; the war was over Argentina’s attempt to take the Falkland Islands, which were a group of small, nothing-special, British-controlled colonial islands. And Reagan accelerated the Cold War with the Soviet Union, which eventually ended the Soviet Union.

**The strong moves by the American central government and central bank changed the flow of money and power and the direction of most everything. The markets respected strength and loved the combination of falling interest rates, falling inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rates, high real interest rates, improving profit margins, and falling tax rates.**It was a capitalist’s delight.I remember the changes in policies and the changes in mood very well, especially the willingness of these leaders to have the fights to do the difficult things, even when doing these difficult things was painful.

**As a result of all of these things, the 1980s were more opposite than similar to the 1970s—i.e., it was a decade of disinflationary growth, strong stock and bond prices in developed countries, and debt bubbles popping leading to classic inflationary depressions in emerging countries.**

Throughout this period, I was deeply involved with these markets and the circumstances that drove them, which gave me the perspective that allowed me to identify great investment opportunities and to describe the mechanics of the process in the last chapter. But that’s not to say that I fully understood all the mechanics behind these big moves from the start. In 1982, I had been dead wrong because I expected the big debt crisis.md) to cause big debt problems for American banks, the stock market, and the American and world economies. I was wrong because I failed to anticipate how forceful the change in global financial flows away from emerging markets and into American markets would be and how well the Federal Reserve and the regulators would protect the American banks. That failure provided me with painful great lessons about the need to watch capital flows and how to do it, about how to diversify to reduce my risks without reducing my returns, and about how to be humble. That painful experience, like my others, turned out to be great because it educated me, which radically improved my and Bridgewater’s performance over the next 30+ years.

**As you can see, all these big movements in markets and economies that had big effects on politics, geopolitics, and technology development were driven by money/debt/capital flows. For that reason, I decided to become an expert on capital flows.**

**The decade from 1971-72 to 1981-82 was a very painful and very classic decade of debt restructurings and debt monetizations that played out following the archetypal template previously described. As is quite typical, the decade that followed it was more opposite than similar.**

**From 1982 to 1990: Falling Inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), Strong Growth, and Levering Up; from One Debt Crisis.md) to Another; Still Operating with an MP2 Monetary Policy**

**The 1979-82 monetary policy changes shifted the environment from benefiting borrower-debtors, as it had in the early 1970s, to benefiting lender-creditors, as it did in the 1980s. As shown below, it lowered the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate, which lowered interest rates while keeping real interest rates relatively high in the 1980s.**The charts below update the previous chart, showing interest rates and inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rates through 1990 so you can see how different the 1980s were from the 1970s. The monetary policy moves that ended the 1970s’ decade-long period of rising inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), rising nominal interest rates, and low real interest rates created the 1980s’ period of falling inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and its relatively high real interest rate environment, which began a long period of falling interest rates. With those things happening and profit margins widening, the 1980s were more opposite than similar to the 1970s. They were almost ideal for the markets and the economy because strong growth was accompanied by falling inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), falling interest rates, and big stock and bond market gains in the US and most developed countries. As shown below from the early 1980s to the early 1990s inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) had fallen a lot and interest rates and the tightness of credit had fallen more, thus shifting the environment from one that was great for lender-creditors and terrible for borrower-debtors to one that was slightly good for borrower-debtors and slightly bad for lender-creditors.

**In the 1980s, the previously described tight money and short dollar (debt) conditions drove the dollar higher until 1985 when there was the “Plaza Accord,” which was an agreement to get the dollar to fall, which it would have done anyway because the large current account deficit and the large demand for dollars were unsustainable.**Throughout these years, there were big swings in interest rates and inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) that felt massive as you lived through them. But the overall dynamic is clear (seen in the prior chart): in the 1980s, inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rates fell as a result of the tightness of money in the 1980-82 period, then interest rates also fell, following inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) down but keeping real interest rates relatively high.**Those high real rates were great for lender-creditors and terrible for borrower-debtors. And then when nominal interest rates fell after inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) began to fall, it was great for bond and stock prices because the discount rate used to value future cash flows fell, and the lower rates made borrowing easier. All of this was good for economic activity. And along with declining inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) it created an ideal set of circumstances for US markets and the economy.**

**But where was this transfer of wealth from? It came from the** **borrower-debtors who held high-interest debt liabilities and debt assets, especially emerging market borrower-debtors who had borrowed in dollars and had their earnings in local currency, and those that lent to them (especially US multinational banks). The cycle that they experienced was classic. The high interest rates not only made dollar debt more expensive to service, but it also helped drive a rally in the dollar. Those countries that had debt liabilities and debt assets denominated in the tight foreign currency (US dollars) that they couldn’t print faced debt default problems, while those countries that had debts in currencies that they could print had their currencies plunge in value due to the money printing. In other words, that produced monetary inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) (i.e., inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) in the currencies they could print) and monetary deflations in the currencies that they owed and couldn’t print.**

**The debt bubbles of the late 1970s turned into classic debt busts when there was a big tightening that tortured both sides with an ugly deleveraging in the 1980s. Those countries facing debt busts, including many emerging countries, experienced a classic full debt cycle over these 20+ years that included inflationary depressions because there were great debt monetizations that depreciated the value of the money and debt denominated in their local currencies while they had deflationary debt default problems in the foreign currency debt that they couldn’t monetize.**That cycle transpired in accordance with the template laid out in the last chapter. The debt bust for these countries created a classic “lost decade” with inflationary depressions in these countries and classic debt workouts for the banks that had lent to them. Eventually, in 1991, there was a classic end to the debt bust that occurred in the way described in the last chapter—i.e., the local currency debt was devalued and the foreign currency debt was restructured. Also, near the end of the cycle, most overly indebted governments sold their government assets to build foreign exchange reserves, and they linked their domestic currencies to the dollar, completing their Big Debt Cycles.

**Of course, each country experienced its own cycle and we will explore a few of these cases, notably China and Japan in Chapters 13 and 14. But there were also important geopolitical shifts during this time that impacted the big cycle for all nations in important ways.**

**During the 1980s, the geopolitical landscape changed as the Soviet Union fell, China rose, and wealth gaps increased. These changes were mostly driven by the Soviet Union’s inadequate financial and economic system.**More specifically, the United States had much more money and productivity than the Soviet Union and so it out-competed the Soviet Union in most everything; notably Reagan had the US outspend and outcompete the Soviet Union in military spending. That led to the Soviet Union’s debt, economic, currency, economic, political, and geopolitical collapses, which were manifest in the fall of the Berlin Wall in late 1989 and the official collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991.

**Deng Xiaoping coming to power in China in 1978 brought about big changes in the 1980s that had big impacts on shaping the changing world order up until now. Deng’s ascension was the beginning of China’s big money/credit/debt/economic cycle. Before then, there was little credit/debt/savings/economic activity. Deng changed that by creating China’s “open door” and “reform” policies, which bought in foreign capitalists with their money and their talent. This swing from pure and extreme communism to market-oriented, capitalism-infused “communism” had a huge impact on China and the rest of the world. That shift unleashed a wave of productivity that led** China to become the greatest trading and manufacturing power ever because it was able to produce many tradable goods at much lower costs than could be produced elsewhere. That had a huge impact on China and other countries, as we will explore later. Because of my relationships in China and my financial market skills I was able to contribute to and watch up close China’s big transformation during this period. I will detail China’s Big Cycle evolution in much more detail in Chapter 13. Suffice it to say for now that China became extremely productive, to a degree that it swamped the world with attractively priced items, earned a ton of money, and lent a ton of money to Americans and others so they could buy Chinese goods. So, Americans got the goods and the Chinese got Americans’ debt and I’m still trying to work out who got the better or worse deal.

**In the 1980s the most important big inventions were laptop computers, lithium-ion batteries, the internet, search engines, the digitalization of thinking, apps, DNA profiling, and big advancements were made in GPS, video-game consoles, microprocessors, and satellite television. Americans remained the leading inventors and investors while other countries were the leading producers.****Most importantly in the 1980s, the technology development force, in which entrepreneurs supported by capitalists, led to the internet being developed which led to the launching of the World Wide Web in 1991 which led to the dot-com bubble emerging in the 1990s’ Big Debt Cycle which led to the dot-com bubble bursting in 2000 when the Fed tightened money to rein in the rapid debt-financed speculation on the dot-com miracle.**

**From 1990 Until 2000: More Disinflation and Leveraging Up, Which Led to a Bubble**

**In brief, as with all decades, the 1990s brought many developments that seemed giant at the time and are barely memorable in retrospect. I wonder if I am giving you too much detail or not enough. To me, at the time these events were unfolding, every minute seemed like an eternity; now I struggle to remember them, which led to my principle that “everything seems bigger up close.” That has helped me keep things in perspective and navigate these changes.**

**Looking back, I am happy to see that I did well navigating them, which I know is because of what I learned and am trying to convey in this study. In brief, the changes I’d highlight are:**

- **The Soviet Union fell in 1991.**
- **Iraq invaded Kuwait to get its oil and the first Gulf War happened in 1990-91, which contributed to rising oil prices, tight money, and a classic recession from mid-1990 to early 1991.**
- **European currencies that were linked together in the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in 1979 broke apart in September 1992. Then Europe went from a bunch of independent countries to a European Union in 1993 and a currency union with the creation of the euro in 1999. They made these choices to unify despite the unimaginable challenge of unifying such different and independent people who had a long history of fighting because in this globalized world they were not viable economic or geopolitical powers if operating separately as individual nations. It remains a highly fragmented union that is declining in competitiveness.**
- **In 1997-98 there was the Asian financial crisis, which, while concentrated in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea affected all countries in the region in the “Asian Contagion.” As is typical, these debt/economic crises led to internal social and political conflicts in all those countries to varying degrees. The worst were in Indonesia, then Malaysia, then Thailand, and the least bad were South Korea and China. These crises were all very classic following the previously described process and exhibiting all the classic leading indicators.**
- **Through most of the decade, globalization and connectivity through the internet were considered good things and flourished.**
- **Climate change started to get attention as an issue.**
- **As is typical, in the 1990s amazing new technology was developed, most importantly, Wi-Fi, smart phones, and e-commerce, and further big advancements were made in GPS, video games, and perhaps most significantly artificial intelligence.**
- **As in all big cycles, all big inventions were financed and accompanied by debt and equity cycles (e.g., the steam engine and the railroads come to mind). In this case, the early development led to excitement that turned into a bubble (in 1995-99), which contributed to an overheating economy and rising inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) which led the central bank (in this case, the Fed) to tighten monetary policy that burst the bubble (in this case, in March 2000) which produced a short-term cyclical downturn in the markets and the economy which ended when the tighter credit and the downturn reduced inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) which led the Fed to ease monetary policy in the classic way.**

**Also in this period, President Clinton succeeded in transforming a large budget deficit into a budget surplus, so it’s one of a number of cases worth remembering to help us think about how to handle things well. There are a few key elements to know about that case which are:**

- **It was done at a time when unemployment was falling and the economy and profit growth were strong, which both brought in tax revenue and allowed the fiscal tightening that is a growth-slowing, inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)-reducing force be well-absorbed. Said differently, the fiscal tightening was counter-cyclical.**
- **The increases in taxes and cuts in spending were significant but moderate.\[10\]**
- **It was done in a bipartisan way (which was key to getting it done) and led to the Balanced Budget Amendment of 1997.**
- **It was eventually and repeatedly overridden by a simple majority because it was simply a legislative statute. That is unlike a constitutional amendment, which is what Germany imposed at the end of the Weimar Republic’s hyperinflation and has worked ever since.**

**From 2000 to 2008: From the Bubble Bursting to Deleveraging to Releveraging Up to Creating a New Bubble That Popped and Led to the Great Financial Crisis and Debt Monetization**

- **I remember Y2K as the crisis that was supposed to come but didn’t, like so many others, yet what was unexpected happened.**
- **The debt/asset bubble burst in March 2000, leading the tech-heavy Nasdaq to fall by around 80%.**
- **On September 11, 2001, the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked which began the war on terror which led to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq**,but it remained a period of very little conflict between the great powers. This happening on the heels of the debt bubble bursting added to problems, which contributed to weakness.
- **These things led to a recession which reduced inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and led to the next short-term debt cyclical easing of credit which then led to a recovery.**
- **In 2006 to 2007 another classic bubble developed. It was a big one, called the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC). It was led by the mortgage/real estate sector being financed by a lot of debt, which led to big debt problems that spread quickly to affect almost everyone in all countries, like the Great Depression in the 1929-39 period did.**
- **What started with the real estate sector spread to both other financial assets and the real economy—unemployment hit 10% in late 2009 and major stock indices were down over 50% from their peak in 2007.**

**In the charts below, you can see the short-term debt cycles, reflected in the unemployment rate and equity prices.**

![](Attachments/1738243415877.png)

- **That drove interest rates to 0% (and below) around the world. Hitting zero eliminated central banks’ ability to ease and stimulate the next wave of credit/debt/economic expansion through interest rate cuts, so central banks turned to printing money and financial assets, also known as debt monetization, quantitative easing, and what I call Monetary Policy 3 (MP3) because it classically follows MP2, which is interest-rate-controlled money and credit growth.**

This time, and classically at such times, central banks did the “printing of money” (expanding their balance sheets) and buying and guaranteeing of debt to make up for the shortfall in the private sector’s demand for debt assets and to keep interest rates artificially low. They always do that even if it doesn’t make economic sense because their objective is to stabilize markets and economies, not to make a profit.**During this part of the Big Debt Cycle, the central bank becomes the big buyer and big owner of debt (the big creditor) rather than private investors. Because the central bank doesn’t mind having losses from holding the debt that has reduced in value, and because it doesn’t worry about getting squeezed, it can continue to prevent a debt crisis.md) by printing money and buying debt.****It is willing and able to lose lots of money and have a negative net worth to protect the government’s and the private sector’s ability to spend even when their finances are bad. This can take place by debt monetization or quantitative easing, which are essentially the same things, though slightly different.\[11\]** One can see it occur via changes in central bank balance sheets by looking at their holdings of debt assets that were acquired by providing those who sold the debt assets to central banks with cash and credit. In the United States, Europe, and Japan, they own roughly 15%, 30%, and 40% of central government debt, respectively, and roughly 5%, 10%, and 20% of the total debt, respectively. In the charts that follow you can see this process unfold in the US. See the timing of the hitting of the 0% interest rate bottom and the printing-of-money expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet. This ended Monetary Policy 2 (i.e., the interest-rate-driven policy to balance the supply and demand for money and credit via interest rate changes) to Monetary Policy 3 (which is for the central bank to make up the shortage of demand by purchasing long-term debt assets and expanding the Fed’s balance sheet). In addition to this happening in the US, it happened in most other countries.

**In the 27 years from 1981 (when interest rates hit “the highest levels since the birth of Jesus Christ”) to 2008 (when interest rates hit 0%), the Big Cycle unfolded with four short-term credit/debt/economic cycles unfolding in it, and when interest rates hit 0%, the interest-rate-driven-monetary policy (which I call MP2) had to be replaced by the quantitative-easing-driven monetary policy (MP3).**

Having studied the big cycles from 1918 to 1945, from when World War I ended, and the new monetary system that began when World War II ended, eight years before MP3 started we put into our investment system rules that if there was a debt contraction crisis and short-term Treasury and fed funds interest rates nearly hit 0%, we would bet on a bad contraction until the central government and the central banks became very stimulative in the ways they became stimulative in March 1933. That served us well in 2008 because we understood it, so we made a lot of money when others lost a lot of money. I saw the big picture of the Big Cycle in interest rates and debt. I saw that since the 1979-82 top in interest rates every cyclical peak and every cyclical trough in interest rates was lower than the one before it until they nearly hit 0% as debt levels increased, which made me wonder what would happen when interest rates hit 0% and let me see that when that happened in the past (in 1933) the central bank printed money and bought the debt. I also saw that the declines of real and nominal interest rates shifted conditions from those that benefited lender-creditors back to those that favored borrower-debtors, which allowed debt/income levels to rise. This downward trend in interest rates and increase in debt burdens set the stage for the next major shift in monetary policy, which we will explore in the next chapter.

**Here are some notable events in internal and external orders, technology, and acts of nature during this 2000 to 2008 period:**

- **Despite the tech bubble bursting, the internet and its effects continued to grow rapidly while many leaders were shaken and new players grew and boomed.**Social media (e.g., Facebook and YouTube) began in 2004 and 2005. The iPhone was released in 2007, which created the “everything device” because of all the things it has on it (phone, camera, and many tools in apps). It was a period in which the internet and computing impacted just about every aspect of daily life. Americans and the US system were behind these far more than others, and then China began to copy and compete effectively.
- **Domestically, political polarization in US politics began to increase, with Democrats turning away from the more centrist 1990s toward leaders more on the left like Barack Obama (though it’s striking how by today’s standards he’s a moderate Democrat), and Republicans eventually turning away from George W. Bush for not being sufficiently populist.**As is classic at this stage in the cycle, media took sides and propaganda was used, so US media became more polarized and polarizing as well.
- **Chinese and other emerging market producers became more competitive** and most everything manufactured, from everyday goods (apparel, toys, appliances, etc.) in the 1990s and 2000s to cars and hi-tech goods now, was inexpensively produced by the Chinese. It was wonderful for the Chinese sellers who earned a lot of money and for the American and other buyers who benefited from the good-value purchases that the Chinese offered and the Chinese sellers lending the money to the US to fund its deficits. This dynamic worked essentially the same way for the Chinese as it worked for Japanese goods manufacturers and their customers. In this case, it was the Chinese who were earning and lending money (e.g., buying US bonds) and who experienced protectionism because it put a lot of manufacturing workers in the US out of work. China, like Japan before it, put a sizable amount of its earnings into its foreign exchange reserves, which led it to buy a lot of US Treasuries because the dollar was the world’s leading reserve currency. That enabled the US government to ramp up deficits and debts without too much consequence (at least so far) while also helping to keep global goods inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) down, which allowed central banks to keep monetary policy easier and contributed to bull markets in stocks. This dynamic was good for the capitalists who owned the means of production and not good for the workers who were displaced.
- **The European Union and NATO continued to take in more Eastern European countries and move closer to the Russian border.**
- **Global warming continued**, with several notable impactful acts of nature, like Hurricane Katrina hitting New Orleans in 2005, raising more concerns about it.

### Chapter 11: The History and Lessons from Phase 3, from 2008 to 2020—Fiat Money and Debt Monetization (Monetary Policy 3)

**In the 2008-20 period:**

- **There were two short-term credit/debt/economic cycles. In each, the amount of debt creation and the amount of debt monetization was greater than the one before it.**

![](Attachments/1738243800850.png)

- **More specifically, in late 2008 the interest-rate-driven monetary system (which I call Monetary Policy 2) couldn’t be used to create money and credit anymore because interest rates hit 0% and, because that could not continue, central banks had to make up for inadequate free-market demand to buy these debt assets by printing money and buying them. As a result, a new monetary system (MP3)—where central banks buy large quantities of debt and provide credit funded with their balance sheets, which is essentially printing money, debt monetization, and quantitative easing—replaced MP2.**While there are slight technical differences between these things that I won’t digress into, they are essentially the same thing, which is **the central bank creating and providing money and credit to the government and marketplace to make up for an inadequate amount of private market lending. I call this Monetary Policy 3.**That began in 2008 and was the first time this monetary policy was used since 1933 (i.e., 75 years earlier). Such moves to debt monetization have occurred throughout history and are symptomatic of being in the late phase of the long-term debt cycle.
- **While the 2008 crisis began in the US, it spilled over into a global crisis, and virtually all developed central banks transitioned from MP2 to MP3 (and many emerging market central banks did too). These actions pushed up the prices of financial assets and pushed down the yields for lender-creditors and created cheap money for borrower-creditors. The stimulative monetary policies that flowed through the system further benefited the rich who had financial assets. The government bailing out the banks contributed to the perception that the system favored the rich which heightened animosity toward the rich capitalists, especially those who seemed to cause the problems and got away free and made a lot of money. Ultimately, the US was able to manage its private sector debt problems and engineer an economic recovery, even as public debt kept rising (effectively kicking the can down the road; more on that later).**
- **The continuing increases in imports of Chinese- and other foreign-produced goods took away American jobs at the same time as new technology was taking away jobs. These forces contributed to the hollowing out of the middle class, which increased tensions between the “elites/capitalists” and the proletariat. China came to hold a lot of US debt assets and the US lost lots of jobs in uncompetitive businesses, which contributed to the creation of large wealth and values differences in the US, anti-China sentiment, and great political and social polarity in the US. People who were hurting economically believed that the “elites” running things and the system were maximizing their profits at the expense of American workers. That, along with the 2008 debt/economic crisis and the fact that the government bailed out financial institutions and benefited those who held financial assets more than it was perceived to help the common man, also had a big impact on domestic conflict. As a result, the financial crisis led to a shift toward populism of the right (e.g., Tea Party movement) and populism of the left (e.g., Occupy Wall Street).**

**Conflict between the politically and socially right and the politically and socially left became greater in response to growing wealth and values differences in most countries, especially in the United States. In the US, the rise of populism of the right, especially among the non-college-educated, non-urban white population, led to Donald Trump’s election in 2016. That changed the American approach to the US and world orders in profound ways that wouldn’t be understood for many years (and, at the time of my writing in January 2025, still are not fully understood). I will describe these changes more extensively at the end of Chapter 12. However, said succinctly, President Trump produced a shift in the domestic, international, economic, political, and geopolitical orders to be much more autocratic, top-down, rightist, nationalistic, protectionist, militaristic, and aggressive. These shifts in policies to ones that are characterized by increased confrontation and reduced levels cooperation and that are also reflected in the breakdowns of multilateral organizations and increased unilateralism are analogous to those that occurred in the periods before World War I and World War II and in many times throughout history.**

- **Trump’s election led to big tax cuts for companies and individuals, the appointment of three conservative justices to the Supreme Court, big cuts in government regulations, the renegotiation of trade and military support deals with other countries, big tariffs, and immigration restrictions. Cutting income and capital gains taxes and reducing regulations helped stock prices rise and the economy grow, so the unemployment rate fell to a 50-year low of 3.5% by the end of 2019.**
- **Then COVID, the first big pandemic since the Spanish flu** **in 1918-19, came along in early 2020**.

These developments and their outcomes (which, for those interested, are explained in more detail in my book *Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order* ) are analogous to those in the early 1930s. They are not unexpected if one understands the Big Cycle.

**The big debt, political, geopolitical cycles and the relationships between them have been unfolding in pretty classic ways so they have been contributors to the overall Big Cycle transpiring in pretty classic ways. What we saw and are now seeing are these three big cycles transpiring along with big disruptions coming from nature (e.g., the pandemic and climate change) around advances in technologies, especially artificial intelligence (that should greatly improve productivity and be disruptive in other ways, too).**

**In Europe, events closely followed the template that I laid out previously, though Europe at the time consisted of 17 countries in the Eurozone, some debtors, and some creditors, which made the process more difficult.**The template of the cycle that I described in earlier chapters played out, in that the overly indebted countries that had their debts denominated in a currency they couldn’t print (the euro) suffered in the way I described, and the European Central Bank handled the situation in the typical way. I will use Greece as an example of how the cycle transpired and what happened to the heavily indebted countries that couldn’t print their own currency because they were tied to the euro. To show how the cycle tracked the template, I will restate what typically happens and then show what actually happened.

**1) The private sector and central government got deeply in debt.**In the 10 years prior to the 2008 financial crisis, Greece’s total debt as a percent of GDP increased by around 90% from 160% to 250%. The impetus was Greece joining the euro, making the country’s debt assets seem much safer (no devaluation risk, backstop from the ECB). Capital flowed in from across the Eurozone, and debt increased in every sector.

**2) The private sector suffered a debt crisis.md), and the central government got deeper in debt to help.**When the 2008 financial crisis hit, the Greek government responded with stimulus and bigger deficits that added to its debt. Because they couldn’t monetize debt, this worsened rather than alleviated the debt crisis.md), so Greece entered a deep depression.

**3) The central government experienced a debt squeeze in which the free-market demand for its debt fell short of the supply of it. That created a government debt problem.**The debt crisis.md) became an acute public sector debt crisis.md) in late 2009 and the Greek government revealed that it had been substantially underreporting its own debt and deficits.

**4) The selling of the government’s debt led to a) a free-market-driven tightening of money and credit, which led to b) a weakening of the economy, c) downward pressure on the currency, and d) declining reserves as the central bank attempted to defend the currency.**The obviously crushing debt burdens and the reporting fraud made Greek debt much less desirable to foreign investors, so they became sellers of Greek debt and Greece needed more stimulus to offset its depression-like conditions. Unavoidably, Greece pursued austerity, which caused the depression to get deeper and made government finances worse (as tax receipts dried up). The result was a massive sell-off in Greek debt, which raised interest rates more and worsened the debt problem even more. By 2012, short-term interest rates in Greece spiked to over 70%. Greek debt increased another roughly 70% of GDP, a combination of austerity not working and GDP declining (a dynamic I call an “ugly deleveraging”).

**5)** ***When there is a debt crisis.md), and interest rates can’t be lowered (i.e.., they hit 0%) the central bank “prints” (creates) money and buys bonds to ease credit and make it easier to service debt.***Actually, it doesn’t literally print money; it essentially borrows reserves from commercial banks that it pays a very short-term interest rate on.The ECB stepped in with huge amounts of crisis money printing and guaranteeing of debt, and expanded its balance sheet just as the Fed did. But that wasn’t nearly enough, and it became politically toxic as the more financially stable European countries decried this bailout of Greece, worrying that one way or another they would have to pay for it.

**6) If interest rates rise, the central bank loses money because the interest rate that it has to pay on its liabilities is greater than the interest rate it receives on the debt assets it bought.**We did not see this dynamic in this case. This typically happens when the central bank has purchased significant government debt at a fixed rate, financed via creating bank reserves that pay floating short rates, and then is forced to raise short rates because of flight from the currency or an inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) problem creating a negative net interest margin for the central bank and forcing the central bank to continue printing money to cover those losses. In the case of the European debt crisis.md), we saw the central bank purchase significant government debt and finance it via creating bank reserves, but in that period, Europe as a whole did not see an inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) problem or currency flight, so the ECB was not forced to raise interest rates and never had a negative net interest margin problem.

**7) Debts are restructured and devalued, reducing debt burdens.**It became clear that Greece needed a debt restructuring, and the money the ECB was spending on Greece was likely to lead to losses. There was even a chance Greece would leave the euro. Meanwhile, the exceedingly tight credit in Greece was crushing the economy. Ultimately, what was called the Troika (ECB, IMF, and the European Commission) engineered a debt restructuring paired with a bailout. In 2012, that restructuring reduced debt burdens by about 50% of GDP.

**8) Extraordinary taxes are raised, and capital flees the country and/or capital controls are imposed.**There was a bank run as smart citizens pulled money out of Greek banks. Needing money, new taxes were introduced, and there was discussion of capital controls, though none were imposed.

**9) There is a transition from a severely devalued currency to a stable currency.**This restructuring was enough to end the most acute phase of the crisis. Greece stayed in the euro. Reducing debt through an explicit restructuring is usually the more painful, drawn-out path. Greece took years to recover, but it did as they all eventually do. If Greece and other overly indebted countries could have printed the currencies they owed, they would have gone down the classic path that was previously described for countries in that position.

**Here are some other key developments:**

- **Regarding international relations, there were big resets economically and geopolitically that led to more allied and enemy geopolitical relationships that were analogous to those that occurred in the 1933-38 period (and numerous prior analogous periods). I won’t digress into these because that would draw us into past Big Cycles, but if you want to get into them, they are covered in my book** ***Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order.***
- **Climate change started to get a lot of attention.**In 2015, there was the Paris Agreement, which initiated an attempt to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. Climate change is a big force that is very costly and will reshape what the human and natural worlds look like that I won’t digress into because the digression would be too great.
- **Regarding new technologies, computer chips rapidly advanced, cryptocurrencies were launched, self-driving-car features started rolling out, movie streaming became more widespread, 4G (and then 5G) wireless began, reusable rocket ships began to be used, and many more advances were made—too many to sensibly digress into here and now.**


## Chapter 12: The History and Lessons from Phase 4, Since 2020—Pandemic and Big Fiscal Deficits Monetized (MP4)

**In 2020, the world was hit with the COVID pandemic. While there is a government financial management principle in the US and in many other countries that monetary policy should be independent of fiscal policy and be targeted to pursue inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and, in the US case, economic growth goals, because without that independence and that independent mandate there would be the politicization and degradation of the supply and value of money, the reality is that nearly every sacrosanct rule is inevitably tested by reality and starts to break down later in the Big Cycle. I call that economic-impact-necessitated change in monetary policy Monetary Policy 4 (MP4). MP4 is when there are coordinated moves between the central government and the central bank, where the government runs large deficits and the bank monetizes them. The dynamic inevitably arises when interest rate changes (MP2) and quantitative easing (MP3) no longer get the job done of helping conditions for most people and when the free-market capitalist system doesn’t get the job done. Naturally the capitalist system provides capital to those who are financially well-off, holding financial assets, and able to borrow, and it doesn’t provide capital to those who have the least and suffer the most. That is what happened in 2008. Because of the COVID pandemic, there was a need not just to make money and credit; there was a need to get it into the hands of specific people and organizations. Throughout history, MP4 has happened in similar conditions when there were very bad economic conditions.md) and big wealth gaps so interest rate changes or quantitative easing alone would not do what is needed. It typically occurred late in the long-term debt cycle. In this case, it came in two big rounds.**

**Below are a few of the previously shown key charts brought up to date. They do a good job of painting the big picture both in terms of what has happened since 2020 and in putting what has happened in perspective within the Big Debt Cycle. As you can see, in the context of the big picture shown in the total chart, the weekly, monthly, and even annual changes seem trivial. I hope these charts help you see the more important bigger pictures.**

**Debt Levels and Debt Service**

The central government spends a lot and hands out lots of money, getting itself into much more debt while relieving the private sector’s debt burdens.

![](Attachments/1738244751084.png)

**Monetary Policy and Central Bank Health**

As shown below, the Fed’s printing of money and buying of the government’s debt increased a lot from 2008 until late 2021, when the Fed began tightening to fight inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md). That was a pretty classic tightening in response to accelerated inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md). The tightening and higher interest rates led the Fed to lose money on all the bonds it had acquired. That is shown in the chart on the right.

![](Attachments/1738244804465.png)

**Interest Rates**

The rise in interest rates, while significant, was less significant than the rise in inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) (see the chart on the left), though it brought the real bond yield up to around its long-term average of ~2% (see the charts on the right and at bottom).

![](Attachments/1738244873147.png)

![](Attachments/1738244882911.png)

**Breakdown of Interest Rates**

The yield curve inverted; the discounted 10-year inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate stayed steady at around 2% as the real yield rose to about 2%. These moves reflected the tightening.

![](Attachments/1738244928460.png)

**The Wealth and Income Shifts**

Labor’s share of earnings continued to trend down to the lowest level since the 1950s, and the wealth and income shares of non-college-educated Americans continued to fall, so the wealth and values gap issue grew worse.

![](Attachments/1738245015251.png)

**During this period, the US population and political parties became much more divided and more extreme, and there was a change in 2020 in leadership from the Trump-led right Republicans to the Biden-led left Democrats.**

**I am now going to look at what happened between 2020 and the present (i.e., January 2025) in more detail. Shifting from my Big Cycle perspective down to the short-term cycle that is transpiring within the long-term Big Cycle can seem disorienting. That dramatic shift from the macro of several decades to the relative micro of years and months can seem like we are moving from big important things to much smaller and less important things, but that is not true. They are both important since the short-term things affect the big long-term things as much as the big long-term things affect the short-term things. Most significantly for this period, it was the time of the pandemic that led to huge stimulation and coordination of fiscal and monetary (Monetary Policy 4), which raised inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and markets and redistributed wealth which produced a big surge in inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) which led to a tightening that helped to bring down inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) which led to a relatively modest easing. It was a time of continued movement to greater political polarity, the political shift to the right, and back to a** **Trump presidency.**

**More specifically:**

- **This short-term cycle easing began in 2020 in response to the combination of a) a COVID-induced economic crisis, b) large wealth gaps, and c) political moves to the left via the elections of a Democratic president, a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, and a Democratic-controlled Senate. The easing took the form of huge government spending increases that led to huge government fiscal deficits and government debt sales that were much greater than free-market lender-creditors would buy, which required central banks, most importantly the Fed, to buy/monetize the debt.**Other entities like banks and Japanese institutional investors also bought a lot of US Treasury debt. That stimulation increased the amount of money/credit/debt/spending by a lot. This massive MP4-type of coordination of fiscal and monetary policies that allows governments to borrow and direct money as it chooses because the central bank buys its debt with printed money is explained more completely starting on Page 37 of my book *Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises*, which you can get here as a free PDF if you’re interested in knowing more and seeing past cases.\[1\] That is what happened in 2020-21; as mentioned, it has happened repeatedly for similar reasons throughout history though not in our lifetime.
- **The 2020-21 debt monetization was the fourth\[2\] and the largest big debt monetization since the original big debt monetization/QE in 2008 (which was the first since 1933).****Since 2008, the nominal Treasury bond yield was pushed down from 3.7% to only 0.5%, the real Treasury bond yield was pushed from +1.4% to -1%, and the non-government nominal and real bond yields fell a lot more (because credit spreads narrowed).****Money and credit became essentially free and plentiful, so the environment became great for borrower-debtors and terrible for lender-creditors and led to an orgy of borrowing and new bubbles forming.**My bubble indicator, which was at only 18% in 2010, rose to 75% at the end of 2020, showing the bubbles in companies and assets that had little or no profits and were funded by selling equity and/or borrowing money based on promises of doing well in the future and speculative buying fever. It was analogous to the Nifty Fifty bubble in the 1970-72 period, the Japan bubble of 1989-90, and the dot-com bubble of 1999-2000. That decline took interest rates so low that they couldn’t continue to fall and it benefited stocks a lot. I estimate that the interest rate decline raised stock prices about 75% more than they would have risen without that decline (compared to the pre-financial-crisis peak). In addition, profit margins nearly doubled on average as a result of technology and globalization, which also boosted profits and profit margins. Corporate and personal taxes declined, which also helped asset prices.**From the post-crisis lows of 2009, the nominal value of US household wealth in financial assets (i.e., “paper wealth”) rose from $32 trillion to $99 trillion, so there was a tripling of paper wealth.\[3\]**
- **That money/credit/debt surge in 2020 produced a big increase in inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), which was exacerbated by supply chain problems and external conflicts (the third of the five major forces that I will touch on later).**
- **That big increase in inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) led to the short-term cycle tightening by the Fed and letting their balance sheets contract by having maturing debt roll off rather than buying more of it. As a result of the Fed (and other central banks) changing their short-term debt cycle mode from easing to tightening, nominal and real interest rates went from levels that were overwhelmingly favorable to borrower-debtors and detrimental to lender-creditors to levels that were more normal (e.g., a 2% real bond yield).**Since the tightening began, US Treasury bond nominal yields rose from 0.5% to over 4% and real yields rose from about -1.1% to about 2.5%, which hurt most asset prices, particularly those with weak or negative profits and/or needs for new equity funding. Naturally that shift especially hurt prices of assets that were in bubbles. My bubble indicator fell from 75% (in a significant bubble) to 35% (not in a bubble) and the bubble stocks in the index fell an average of 75%.**As a result, the nominal value of wealth in stocks and bonds fell by ~12% in the US and the real value of wealth fell by nearly 18%, which were the largest declines since 2009.**As cash went from “trash” to “attractive” and bothshort-term nominal and real interest rates were brought to levels that were more attractive than they were for lender-creditors and more unattractive than they were for borrower-debtors, and the yield curve inverted, these changes had the very classic effect of lowering the present values of most investment assets’ future cash flows and strengthening the dollar relative to the currencies of other countries whose central bankers were slower to tighten. In other words, the Fed’s quick movement brought US dollar-denominated cash to relatively attractive levels in relation to most assets, cash denominated in other currencies, and gold, which as usual, hurt interest-rate-sensitive sectors like commercial and residential real estate, as well as low or negative cash flow bubble companies, both public and private, though public more so. For example, the then-hot “FAANG” stocks and the tech-heavy NASDAQ fell from their peaks by around 45% and 33%, respectively. Non-public market assets—private equity, venture capital, and real estate assets—were not marked down commensurately as there was a great reluctance to accept the markdowns. Write-downs and having down fundraising rounds became too painful for both the companies and the venture capital and private equity managers in these markets, so there has been, to this day, a stand-off in which sellers and buyers can’t agree on prices and transaction volumes have plunged. It did not however weaken the economy as much as it typically would have because it was the central government that got into more debt rather than the private sector and it was the central bank that bought the debt and had the losses from holding it rather than the private sector. Also, the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) was in wages and other compensation being earned as well as in goods and services being bought.
- **Then inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) fell but prices stayed high, and the Fed and other central banks eased their monetary policies which supported asset prices generally. Artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence companies became the new hot things and are expected to improve the economy and life hugely like the new hot things that produced the industrial and digital revolutions and led to financial bubbles. With these changes came great differences in which stocks, companies, and countries did well.**Also, the world capital markets changed with new types of investment products, though in the same sort of ways we saw before. For example, we are seeing new types of lending, like the development of the private credit market, which is the modern-day version of the junk bond market of the late 1970s early 1980s (though more customized, not securitized, more illiquid, and inclusive of early-stage companies). The large amount of money entering this type of lending helped to keep credit spreads down and fund more speculative activities.
- **Regarding the internal conflicts over wealth and values between the populists of the right and the populists of the left, the intensity increased in most democracies, most importantly in the US.**In the US, the divide between the political right and the political left became more extreme and the big rises in prices that came from the earlier described big fiscal and monetary stimulations by the US central government and central bank led to big price increases in goods, services, and financial assets.**In the 2024 election, this inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and other factors such as President Biden’s impaired acuity helped a) the rightist/capitalists/social conservative Donald Trump and the Republican Party to a decisive win over b) the leftist/socialist/social liberal Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party, giving Trump a mandate to undertake a big renovation of the central government and the country as a whole and prepare for some type of war with China and its allies.**The potential great conflict that would have likely occurred if there was a close Trump loss was averted.

**That brings us up to where we now are.**

**The Five Big Forces: Debt, Civil War, International War, Acts of Nature, and Technology**

**Every day we see news about these five forces. If you connect the dots from the past to the present, you can see them evolving along the lines of the Big Cycle template that was comprehensively explained in my book** *Principles for Dealing with the [Changing World Order*](https://economicprinciples.org/)**, my** 40-minute video**, and my** 5-minute video**.**Government debt is obviously a big and growing issue. The thus-far nonviolent civil war between the rightists/capitalists/MAGAs and the leftists/socialists/communists/woke is continuing to intensify, and in the 2024 US election the rightists/capitalists/MAGAs beat the leftists/socialists/communists/woke. Simultaneously and relatedly, the international war, particularly between the United States and its allies (i.e., the allied powers) and China and its allies (i.e., the axis powers), is intensifying. Similarly, the acts of nature force, most importantly climate change, is intensifying, and technology, especially AI, will have a big impact, both good and bad, that we won’t be able to imagine. These issues are interrelated. Most importantly, the internal fight within the US and the external fight with China will be affected by the technology war and the economic war (e.g., the need to raise military spending). For previously explained reasons, this looks quite like the 1936-38 period.

**Because of the importance of China, I will now briefly review its whole Big Cycle since 1945 (when the new world order began) to 1949 (when its new domestic order began). Then I will look at Japan’s Big Cycle focusing most on how its Big Debt Cycle unfolded there because it provides another good case study to understand to gain the valuable lessons it offers. After that, I will look at what the key measures and calculations show in an attempt to peek ahead, and I will conclude with some suggestions.**

### Chapter 13: China’s Big Cycle from 1945-49 Until Now in a Very Tiny Nutshell

*This chapter will take you about fifteen* *minutes to read and it explains how the Big Cycle has played out in China, bringing you right up to the present, so I think it is worth the read for those interested in that.*

**To put China’s history in the context of its Big Cycle, I will summarize what has happened since the start of the new world order and China’s domestic order in the 1945-49 period with a very brief look at what happened before then.**

**Before 1945**

To look at China before our current Big Cycle, I will first draw your attention to the following chart that shows the Big Cycles of China back to the year 600. This measure shows the estimated relative strength of China using many measures of strength as described in *Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order*. Having studied these cycles, I have found them to be consistent with the Big Cycle template that I am touching on in this study and I comprehensively explained in that book.

![](Attachments/1738245287020.png)

**In the chart below, you can see China’s Big Debt Cycles since 1865, which is 26 years after the Century of Humiliation began until now.**This 110-year period of humiliation (as the Chinese call it) was the period in which foreign powers humiliated and exploited China, starting in 1839 with the First Opium War and in 1949 with Mao and the Chinese Communist Party coming to power and the founding of the People’s Republic of China. As you can see from this debt cycle, big debts were built up, wiped out, and built up again. As is typical, the debt wipeout corresponded with internal and external wars (in 1945-49); then there was a new order, and debts were built up again. However, through most of these years Chinese money and debt were not considered a good storehold of wealth.

**While I will not delve into China’s prior Big Cycle that encompassed the Century of Humiliation, I do want to touch on it and convey that it profoundly affected Chinese leaders’ perspectives on foreign powers and what is now going on domestically. That part of China’s history is deep in the Chinese leaders’ psyche and has led to a belief that the way foreign powers are now fighting for their economic interests is broadly analogous to the way they did during the Century of Humiliation.**More specifically, China’s leaders see the US operating as a hegemon to control the world order to serve its self-interests and trying to contain China in the part of the world that the US is not part of. Most significantly, they now see America’s handling of Taiwan as being even more intrusive than Americans saw Russia’s influence in Cuba in the 1960s because from their perspective Taiwan has been “indisputably and consistently” recognized as part of China by all the world’s powers since the end of World War II. Of course, Chinese leaders know that Taiwan is part of China but has not been incorporated back into China. There is no question that Chinese leaders expect to eventually take control of Taiwan and parts of the South China Sea. In contrast, most Americans see China as a big and growing threat to the United States and the existing US-led world order, and they see the Chinese as being ideologically threatening communists who autocratically control their people and who are in a great ideological war with its capitalist, democratic, Abrahamic (i.e., Judeo-Christian-Islamic) approach. Some in both Washington and Beijing see this conflict as being the last and biggest great religious-ideological-economic-military war. Of course, this relationship is complicated and there are at least two sides to this story, which I won’t go into because it would be too large of a digression. I just wanted to make clear that Chinese leaders’ historical perspective has a big effect on how they think and what they do. More broadly, they are very aware of big cycles and what caused them in terms of all five of the big forces that I’ve described.

**The most important things to know are that China has had a rise that was more powerful than any other country in history to become a great power that is nearly comparable in power to the United States and that the United States and China have entered into a period of great power conflict.**The next two charts show my aggregate readings of relative powers since 1825 and my US-China conflict gauge since 1963. As you can see in the first chart, China’s relative power fell a lot during the Century of Humiliation and then rose a lot thereafter, so that it is now close to rivaling the US. This is leading to a classic great power conflict between the US and China and their allies. On my website,www.economicprinciples.org, you can see much more detail on the measures that led to this reading for China.

Here is my very brief description of what has happened in China since 1945.

In **1945,**World War II ended,**which led to the creation of the new and current world order, and in 1949, China’s civil war ended, which led to the creation of the new and current domestic order.**

**From 1949 until 1976, China was a strictly isolated communist country run by the revolutionary leader Mao Zedong and his chief administrator, Zhou Enlai.**During those years, China recovered slowly from World War II and its civil war because it was encumbered by rigid and unproductive communist economic policies, draconian controls that ensured that Mao and the Chinese Communist Party remained in power, and isolation from the rest of the world. In Big Cycles, it is typical for those who win power in a civil war to suppress the opposition to consolidate and solidify their power over the opposition due to fears that they will be overthrown. In Chinese dynasties, secret and violent overthrows of leaders have been frequent that they are viewed as a constant threat. That went on throughout Mao’s life. Mao had many enemies, most importantly capitalists from within China and the Soviet Union (starting in the late 1950s) from outside it. Marxist-Leninist communist principles and isolation from “foreign devils” shaped what China did and didn’t do during the 1949-76 period. During Mao’s reign, China’s development fell behind the rest of the world’s and there was a lot of suffering, especially in the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. As far as dealing with foreign powers was concerned, Mao’s greatest fear was the Soviet Union, which became increasingly threatening in the 1960s and especially in the 1970s. As has typically been the case throughout history and is conveyed in the adage “the enemy of my enemy is my friend,” the common enemy brings countries together, which was true in this case, in which the common enemy of the United States and China was the Soviet Union. That led to the visits to China first by Henry Kissinger and soon after by President Nixon. Because I knew both Henry Kissinger and Ji Chaozhu well, I learned a great deal about both sides’ perspectives, which I won’t digress into here but will share in a book that I’m writing on China. Suffice it to say that common interests and a common enemy brought them together in 1972.

**Mao and Zhou died in 1976.**

**As described in Chapter 10, Deng Xiaoping came to power in 1978 and changed just about everything with his “reform” and “open door” policies, which introduced a much freer, market-based economic system that brought in foreign talent and capital to enable the Chinese.**He distinguished the new way with statements like “it is glorious to be rich” and when asked about his move to a more market-capitalist direction, he said, “It doesn’t matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice.” This was the recognition that the market-capitalist systems can “catch mice” (i.e., make riches) and that it is best to get rich and powerful first and then work toward “common prosperity.” **These policies led to China having huge economic advances that changed not only China but the whole world. China went from being a poor, weak country to being a very strong one.**

**I saw all this up close from 1984 until now and, through my contact, got to see things through Chinese leaders’ eyes.**I started to go to China in 1984 as a guest of CITIC, which was the only “window company” (because it could deal with the outside world in a capitalist way). They asked me to teach them about the world’s capital markets. China didn’t have any money at the time so I didn’t go for that; I went at first because I was curious, and I kept going until now because I loved the people and culture, and I could have a good impact on the country’s markets and economic development. That gave me an invaluable education as well as lots of enjoyment, so much so that I don’t dare describe it entirely because it would be too great a digression. What I am now going to describe is through the lens of my experiences.**I watched that combination of powerful economic reform and opening up to the outside world take China from:**

**1) a classic unproductive communist country to**

**2) an effective “socialist market economy” to**

**3) the development of its capital markets and its version of capitalism to**

**4) the forming of a classic debt bubble that led to**

**5) a classic debt bust of the type that those who have their debt denominated in their own currency and have most of the debtors and creditors as their own citizens have.**

More specifically, China experienced a classic upward swing in the Big Cycle that took China’s people from terrible poverty to much-improved living standards, with many people and the country as a whole gaining great riches and powers. At the same time, there were big increases in indebtedness and developments in the capital markets that created big wealth gaps and a bubble.**I witnessed up close China go from grappling with its poverty and its geopolitical weaknesses to creating its market/debt reform and open-door policies, which created great increases in its riches and geopolitical power, to grappling with these greater wealth and geopolitical powers because with them came big wealth and opportunity gaps and big domestic and international conflicts.**

**In the Deng era, I saw the Big Cycle unfold up close as follows:**

- **China brought its inexpensive labor and high productivity gains to provide the world with attractively priced manufactured goods.**
- **The US and most of the world liked getting attractively priced manufactured goods on good terms, especially because China used a lot of the money it earned to lend money to Americans who bought the merchandise, which led to the following:**
- **China’s income, wealth, and power increased greatly. At the same time, the US overborrowed.**
- **In 2008, the US had a big debt crisis.md) that put China in the position of not knowing if a large portion of its debt assets would be paid back and questioning the United States’ financial strength.**I was in the midst of that situation and must say that the Chinese side handled the debt crisis.md) with grace and understanding.
- **In 2008 the Group of 20 (G20) countries, which was formed to be a more realistically representative group of powerful countries than the G7 given the shifts in world power, had its first summit to deal with the global financial crisis. They agreed to be very stimulative, so China and virtually all countries increased the credit they made available, which improved conditions, increased wealth gaps, and raised debt levels relative to income levels.**As explained earlier, in the US the widening wealth gaps and economic suffering of those left behind created a change in sentiment to blame the Chinese for their job-loss problems. Those American workers who were most adversely affected were the non-college-educated men who Donald Trump appealed to.**At the same time, American companies complained that they were not allowed to fairly compete as equals in China and that the Chinese were stealing Americans’ intellectual property.**
- **China’s skills and powers continued to grow, which gave China the resources to develop its military, geopolitical influence, and technological powers, which led it to become more assertive and seemingly threatening. In 2009 China asserted that the proper boundaries of its territory were far beyond what other countries claimed they were, pointing to an old map that demarcated the boundary with a nine-dash line.**Though in 2016 the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled against China’s claim, the dispute continues to today.
- **President Xi and the new leadership team came to power in 2012.****The main goals of the new leadership team were to reform the economy and eliminate corruption.****Because of my expertise and my long and trusted relationships, I was able to participate in the discussions about these things in the third plenum (the new government’s big planning meeting after the top people are appointed). I experienced a very open and collaborative environment in which key issues were discussed, and we exchanged thoughts about them openly. Reforming the economy meant modernizing it to be more market-driven.**For example, back then six major banks lent money to state-owned enterprises that were implicitly guaranteed by the government that had the printing press to guarantee them, and there was little lending to small- and medium-size enterprises. The leadership wanted to change that, so they sought to develop capital markets that improved access to borrowing, lending, and investing. I was closely involved with that, so I saw how those responsible for it thought about it and what they did. I found that for most of Xi’s first five-year term, there was a) an openness to outside thinking, b) a strong desire to further reform the economy by making it more market-driven and taking actions to build and reform the capital markets, and c) strong action taken to eliminate corruption. The senior leaders chosen were the ones who were inclined to do those things. Of course, how to do these things was debated, and some people benefited from the changes while others were hurt by them, which created divisions. I saw the following happen:
- **Late in Xi’s first term there was a movement to consolidate political power around him via a move to “core leadership.”** If you think politics in the United States is brutal, you should see politics in China. This became most clear in the leadership changes that accompanied the shift from the first to the second five-year term under Xi.
- **Up until then there were remarkable accomplishments—by many measures the greatest in human history. In the years since I first started going to China in 1984, China’s per capita income increased by 20 times, the average life expectancy increased by 12 years, and the poverty rate fell from 81% to less than 1%.**
- **In 2015, Xi put out his 2025 plan, which described the need for China to rise and dominate certain industries. This was viewed as aspirational by the Chinese and threatening by the Americans. China could no longer “hide power.” Also, China became more threatening as it grew a lot in world trade, as its riches grew, as it asserted itself more geopolitically, and as it “stole” intellectual property. At this time, Americans began to blame China for their economic problems and viewed China as a greater threat.**
- **Due to middle-class job losses in the US, which were attributed to Chinese imports and China’s greater assertiveness internationally, the pendulum of sentiment toward China swung from positive to negative.**
- **When President Trump came to power in 2017 and President Xi began his second term in 2018, the great power conflict began in earnest**, starting with trade negotiations that evolved into tests of power and a type of cold war. Then in 2019-20, COVID emerged. At the same time, China’s debt bubble and wealth gaps grew, and relations with the US worsened, so there was a classic convergence of big debt/financial, internal order, external order, acts of nature forces into a risky mix. Also, the Taiwan issue was (and still is) a very big contentious issue because China expected the One China unification promise to be delivered on while there seemed to be movement toward more independence. This has been intensified because most of the advanced computer chips in the world were (and still are) produced in Taiwan, and whichever country controls them controls the most powerful technology in the world. Seeing all those contentious domestic and international issues evolve, in addition to his understanding of history, led President Xi to say that there is a “big 100-year storm” on the horizon.
- **In 2020, much of China was shut down due to COVID, which raised some internal ire about how it was being handled.**
- **In 2021, a bit more than halfway through Xi’s second term, China’s domestic debt bubble burst. Xi emphasized the importance of “common prosperity” and did not like how rich businessmen were arrogant and exerted influence over how China was being run, so the government took some seemingly arbitrary actions that were not consistent** **with the type of rule of law and traditional property protections that investors thought were important.**
- **At the beginning of President Xi’s third term in October 2022, China’s leadership shifted from reform-minded globalists to loyal communist nationalists with tighter controls over possible opposition, and it shifted from being highly free-market-oriented with capital markets flourishing to being more Mao-like communist as internal conflict and the international great power conflict intensified.**
- **At this moment, China is now a country that is 1) in a big debt crisis.md) while it is turning to more traditional communist economic policies at the same time as there are great advances continuing, while 2) there is increased internal conflict that is being contained by more strict, autocratic policies directed by the president, while 3) there is increased international conflict with the United States and great changes in the world which China is increasingly influencing, while 4) climate change is happening and likely to have a big effect on China, while 5) it is vying to lead and win a technology war that neither China nor the United States can afford to lose.**
- **Now, the Trump administration has come into power in the US, which also has 1) big debt issues, while 2) there is increased internal conflict leading to more strict, semi-autocratic policies directed by the president, while 3) there is increased international conflict with China and great changes in the world order with the US under Trump shifting from being a global leader to becoming an “America First” nationalistic participant in the changing world order, while 4) climate change is likely to have a big effect on it, while 5) it is vying to lead and win a technology war that neither China nor the United States can afford to lose. So,****we** **are now seeing a squaring-off of these two great powers, along with their allies lining up behind them and their ideologies, which looks a lot like what we saw in the mid to late 1930s when the world was at a similar stage in the Big Cycle.**What will happen in the US and China and the world will be another test of the relative strengths of these two great powers and their two very different approaches and systems. These two great powers are now in a war that fortunately for the world hasn’t yet turned militaristic. This is shaping up to be the greatest great powers conflict ever. A very senior Chinese leader many years ago explained to me how differently these two sides fight war; he explained to me how Western countries follow a Mediterranean approach to war, which is head-on, while the Chinese use a much more subtle, deceptive approach along the lines of what was described in *The Art of War* by Sun Tzu, which was written about 2,500 years ago. Over my many years and through my intimate contacts in China, I learned about the power of such timeless principles that affect the Chinese leaders’ approaches to dealing with the Chinese people and the outside world.

**In ultra-brief summary, below I look at what happened in China vis-à-vis my Five Big Forces template:**

1) The Big Debt Cycle force led to China’s debt rising relative to incomes, though not relative to liquid assets until 2009 (coming out of the GFC). Then it, especially local government, corporate and real estate debt, started to grow into a bubble that burst in 2021, which began a deleveraging. Like Japan’s, most of China’s debt is denominated in its local currency, which allows it to engineer a “beautiful deleveraging,” which Japan failed to do. We don’t yet know whether China will manage this well, though it now appears to me that China has been slow to deal with it and is in the late part of the Big Debt Cycle that is most analogous Japan’s in 1990.

2) The internal conflicts and internal politics force led the government to tighten controls, leading to an environment of more fear, which has slowed decision making, which has chilled the economy and hurt capital and people flows, which has contributed to economic slowness in China. It has moved about halfway back toward Maoist-Marxist communist policies.

3) The external conflict force led to the classic great powers conflict with the United States, which has hurt flows of trade, capital, and people and led to greater military preparation and risk.

4) The acts of nature forcetook the form of the COVID pandemic problem that started in late 2019 and continued through 2022, which strained the population’s satisfaction for how leadership was handling it which contributed to the government increasing controls. China also used its remarkable inventiveness, its government-directed economic policies, and its advanced manufacturing abilities to make such great strides in solar and wind power that it has become the world’s most cost-effective producer of these items, which is another story that I won’t digress into.

5) The technology force led China and the US to both make advances in a number of new technologies, most importantly in advanced AI, with China seemingly having fallen behind the US in the most advanced chips while at the same time excelling in some other areas, most obviously in advanced manufacturing.

So, in brief, in recent years four out of the five major forces (i.e., debt/economic, internal conflicts, international conflict, and the acts of nature) have become increasingly threatening to China, and the fifth, the technology force, appears to be a mixed picture because great advances have been made while China looks to have fallen behind in some existentially important areas. It seems inevitable that the US and China will face another test of their relative powers and their approaches to a) capitalism and democracy versus b) communism and autocracy.

**China’s Big Debt Cycle in Some Charts**

I am now going to show you a bunch of charts that do a good job of painting China’s debt picture, but I won’t get into an analysis with a commentary because a more complete proper analysis would be too much of a digression for now. Also, notably not all the debts are properly accounted for, so these charts are meant to just be broadly indicative.

As shown, China is in the part of the cycle where the non-central-government debt burdens have become excessive and a problem so that the central government and the central bank will have to come to their aid. Fortunately, most of the debt is denominated in local currency and most of the debtors and creditors are domestic so that the central government and the central bank have much greater ability to manage this situation than if they weren’t. However, China’s currency (the renminbi) is not a widely held reserve currency, so not an effective storehold of wealth. Ideally, Chinese policy makers would have both the ability and the courage to swiftly engineer a “beautiful deleveraging.” However, as previously explained, such adjustments are initially painful because they cause great shifts in wealth and, if not balanced properly, can just shift the debt burdens, worsen the long-term central government debt burdens, and/or so severely undermine the value of the currency as to do great damage to the capital markets and through it to the economy. The Japanese case, and the next chapter on it, provides some valuable lessons for them (as well as for other policy makers, investors, and businesspeople).

As shown below, China’s debts are reaching new highs, even as the economy is weaker than desired. That’s been the dynamic in Japan over much of the last couple decades as well.

![](Attachments/1738245727917.png)

The chart below on the top left shows the levels of 10-year bond yields relative to the stated one-year and three-year average headline inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) numbers. Actual deflation in both items and in investments held has been worse than is shown here. As shown in the chart at bottom, nominal government bond rates are approaching zero, so other “non-conventional” fiscal and monetary policies will likely have to be used. Also, as shown in the top-right chart, real bond yields are about 0.5%, so a) they are relatively unattractive in a normal environment but b) still relatively attractive in relation to a deflating economy with falling asset prices, and also c) relatively unattractive relative other countries’, especially the US dollar bond market’s interest rates.\[4\]

As shown below, the yield curve (as of January 2025) is inverted, which makes cash relatively attractive at a time when that encourages a holding of cash which leads to a “pushing on a string” issue. I previously conveyed my thinking about this in Chapter 1 so I won’t repeat it. Also as shown, various measures of liquidity (total social financing, money supply, total loans from the financial sector) continue to rise without producing a rebound in real economic activity, another sign of “pushing on a string.”

### Chapter 14: The Japanese Case and the Lessons It Provides

***This chapter will be relevant to those who are interested in studying the mechanics of Big Debt Cycles and it probably won’t be of much interest to those who are not. That is because it shows how a heavily indebted reserve currency country handled its debts with reference to the earlier-described template. Most importantly, this Japanese case study shows the Big Cycle in Japan transpiring in the very classic way that I described, with the cause/effect relationships working as I described. In this case study, you will see that for 23 years Japanese policy makers did the exact opposite of what I described should be done to execute a beautiful deleveraging—i.e., after their debt bubble burst they did not restructure the debts for nine years and they didn’t drive interest rates below inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rates and nominal growth rates for 23 years, so they had deflationary depressing conditions until 2013 when there was a fiscal stimulation accompanied by a great debt monetization and great depreciation in the value of their debt assets and currency. While this Japanese case study tells a very interesting story for those who are interested in seeing how the economic machine works, it does get a little technical which is good for those who want that, but those who don’t can skip it by just reading the highlights in bold which will take only about five minutes.***

**Japan’s story, like China’s story, is a very interesting one that extends back to its Big Cycle before the one that began in 1945. To put Japan’s history into the clear context of its Big Cycle, I will summarize what happened since the beginning of the new world and domestic orders starting in 1945 with a very brief look at what happened before 1945. I’m doing that because, as with the China story, the Japan story since 1945 would be greatly lacking in context if we didn’t at least briefly touch on the Big Cycle dynamics of the 100 years before.**

**In brief Japan, like China, was isolated from the rest of the world until the foreign powers—in Japan’s case, US Commodore Matthew Perry and his American fleet—came and demanded to trade with Japan. Because the foreign power was greater, that led to the collapse of Japan’s 250-year-old domestic order, which was under the Tokugawa (family) shogunate (government headed by a family). Because of the realization that the foreign, more modern approaches were better, that government was replaced by a new government in 1868, which largely copied the Western powers’ approaches (similar to what Deng Xiaoping did). It was a constitutional monarchy that was led by a new emperor (Meiji). That led to the modernization of Japan, achieved largely by following the Western style of education, economy, and military. These policies of reform and opening up that copied the policies of the more modernized Western powers, like those in China under Deng, led to Japan becoming a great power. Then it fought and defeated its two rival regional powers—China in 1894-95 and Russia in 1904-05 which was followed by the annexation of Korea in 1910. Then in 1914-18 it decided to take advantage of Germany’s fighting in Europe in World War I to take over German territories in Asia. In the 1930s, it invaded and took over China’s Manchuria (1931) and more of China (1937). Then it got into a geopolitical conflict with the United States that had similar trade and sanction conflicts to the US-China conflict today, with oil then being like chips now. This led to Japan attacking the US naval fleet at Pearl Harbor, which led to a war with the United States that Japan lost due to the United States inventing a great new and powerful technology that could be used for peaceful and war purposes—nuclear power. Because of Japan losing the war, all Japanese money and debt was destroyed, and Japan was occupied and reconstructed by the United States from 1945 until 1952.**

**The chart below shows the total debt-to-GDP ratio.md) going back to 1870. It shows both the Big Debt Cycle prior to 1945 and the one since.**As you can see, there was the big run-up in debt in the 1930-45 period before and during the war, the debt wipeout that brought it down to low levels until 1970, the big debt bubble leading to the debt bust in 1989-90, and the rise in that ratio until recently. That is what the Big Debt Cycles looked like since 1870. As is normal when looking at the Big Debt Cycles, the short-term debt and economic cycles are imperceptible.

**Since 1945**

**In brief, from 1945 through 1990, Japan rebuilt itself to become the second greatest economic power in the world and in the process built up a huge debt burden that burst in 1989-90, which has had a huge weakening effect on Japan ever since.**After World War II and with the US’s blessing, Japan chose not to build up its military power and instead chose to be a protectorate subject of the United States. I will now focus on the time from the debt bubble bursting until now because that is the most relevant period to understanding the part of the Big Debt Cycle that this study is focused on. The lessons that examining this part of the Big Debt Cycle provides in helping us understand other cases—most importantly the current cases in the United States, China, and Europe—are very valuable. Since I am focused on the deleveraging part of the Big Cycle, I won’t cover the 1944-90 period and will focus on the post-1990 period.

**The Big Debt Cycle Since 1990**

**The Japanese government’s handling of its debt problem from 1990 until 2013 exemplified exactly what not to do. It was the exact opposite of what I described should be done to execute a beautiful deleveraging even though it had the capacity to execute a beautiful deleveraging because almost all of its debt was denominated in its local currency and almost all of the difficult debtor-creditor relationships were between Japanese parties, plus it was a net creditor to the rest of the world. More specifically, policy makers did not restructure their debts so the debt burdens lingered on bank and company balance sheets making them “zombie institutions,” they held to employment and cost policies that were rigid so they didn’t effectively cut costs and adapt, they didn’t make interest rates low in relation to both nominal growth rates and inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), and they did not monetize their debts until after there was deflation and interest rates were near zero in 1995. For nearly two decades, the amount of fiscal and free-market policy adjustments and the amounts of monetary stimulus and debt purchases were woefully insufficient to engineer a beautiful deleveraging. As a result, until 2012 Japan had continuous deflation and economic stagnation as companies and people didn’t have the previously described financial conditions to get this debt burden crisis behind them. The Japanese government did not deal with its non-performing loan problem until 1999 (so for nine years after the debt bubble popped) when the government finally forced the banking system to restructure its debts and injected huge amounts of capital into the banks, and it didn’t monetize debt and bring interest rates significantly below nominal growth and inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rates until 2023. Additionally, the demographics of Japan’s aging population (e.g., in 1990, 12% of the population was over 65 and 69% of the population was working-age while now 29% of the population is over 65 and only 59% is working-age).**

**Fiscal and monetary policies changed greatly and appropriately when BoJ Governor Kuroda and Prime Minister Abe came to power in late 2012/early 2013 and initiated their “three arrows” policy to 1) increase the money supply, 2) boost central government spending, and 3) enact economic and regulatory reforms to make the Japanese economy more competitive, which, as previously described, are classically the best policies to negate deflationary, depressionary forces. As a result, from 2013 through 2019 there was not deflation and there was low positive growth (0.9% per year) and the beginning of a healing period, though the deflationary and depressing psychological conditions lingered. The psychological overhang of the 23 years of debt depression has had lasting negative effects on the country’s strength and vibrancy that had characterized Japan prior to 1990 and many times throughout history.**

**Since 2013, extremely large debt monetization and fiscal deficit stimulus (5% of GDP deficits on average) and extremely large central bank buying of Japanese yen debt (the BoJ now holds government bonds worth >90% of GDP) took place, which pushed interest rates 0.9% below the nominal growth rate and 1% below the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate on average, and depreciated the yen, all of which was very stimulative. The combined lower interest rates and currency depreciation led to Japanese government bonds being a terrible storehold of wealth, losing 45% relative to US bonds and 60% relative to gold. These and other actions provided an average interest rate that was about 2.2% below the US rate and depreciated the currency by an average rate of 5.5% per year in real terms versus USD. More specifically, since 2013, the cumulative return of a Japanese government bond relative to a US government bond was -45%, which is almost entirely attributable to currency depreciation, since the lower carry/accrual from Japanese bonds was entirely offset by price gains (roughly +20%) due to falling Japanese yields. At the same time, Japanese inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) averaged only 1.1% per year relative to US inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) of 2.7% per year because of domestic deflationary pressures. The principle “don’t own government bonds at such times” should resonate.**

Let’s look at what happened more closely.

Since 2013, while there was modest inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) of 0.8% per year in average worker compensation in yen terms, the big yen depreciations, along with greater wage gains in other nations, made them more competitive. For example, there was a total decline of 58% in the cost of a Japanese worker relative to an American worker since 2013. Similarly, other domestic items in Japan fell a lot in cost relative to the costs in other countries. That helped to make Japan more competitive. These changes are shown in the charts below.

![](Attachments/1738246244740.png)

**These low interest rates reduced debt service costs a lot—since 2013 Japanese interest debt service fell over 50% (and has fallen over 65% since 2001), making it much easier to service the debt.**

**Still, the Japanese debt during this period increased by almost 10%. To neutralize its effects, the Japanese central bank bought over half of all the government debt and absorbed the debt service costs, which it monetized. The declines in interest rates engineered by the BoJ also contributed to the debt relief (though more of that benefit occurred even before Governor Kuroda took the helm, as short rates had already hit zero).**

![](Attachments/1738246279266.png)

The following charts show these trends. The bottom left shows the substantial declines in the interest service actually paid by the government to the public, and the other charts show how you got there: through central bank purchases and large declines in interest and principal payments.

![](Attachments/1738246334732.png)

As a result, remarkably the massive increase in debt that occurred in this period was concurrent with an improvement in Japan’s central government balance sheet. Net assets (government assets minus government liabilities) are now 20% better in dollar terms compared to 2013 because the Bank of Japan accumulated dollar reserves (primarily in the 2001-12 period) and Japan’s debts as measured in dollars are not up as much due to the yen currency depreciation.

![](Attachments/1738246378890.png)

**Who were the winners and who were the losers? Clearly the big losers were the Japanese debt holders including the Japanese central bank. The Japanese bond holders lost a total of 6% in real terms (as real yields were generally negative), 45% versus if they had instead held US bonds, and 60% relative to the old “hard money” of gold. Below is a chart of the real return of just holding JGBs as a Japanese investor (in local currency) and their performance relative to US bonds and gold.**

![](Attachments/1738246404592.png)

At the same time, there has been a big deterioration in the BoJ’s balance sheet. These losses will be very large if Japanese real and nominal bond yields rise to more reasonable levels (e.g., 2% and 3% respectively).

For example, if Japan had a 3% rise in real interest rates (from -0.3% to 2.7%):

- **The BoJ would experience a 30% of GDP mark-to-market loss on its bond holdings and would be in a seriously negative cash flow situation of around -2.5% of GDP.**
- **The government would see the deficit widen from roughly 4% of GDP to around 8% of GDP over the next 10 years due to the increase in interest costs (not including any outlays to cover central bank losses).**The government debt level would surpass its post-WWII peak, rising from 220% to 300% over the next 20 years.

![](Attachments/1738246479484.png)

- **The combined cash flow need across the central bank and the government would be around 5-6% of GDP per year, which is huge.**That would have to be handled through debt issuance, money printing, and/or deficit reduction. If it was financed by central bank printing, this would be **the equivalent of another round of QE in terms of expansion of the money stock**, not including any additional printing needed to offset selling by the private sector.
- Resolving it would require even greater write-downs in debt and devaluations of the currency—with Japanese people becoming relatively poorer in the process—until Japan is competitive enough to begin a new cycle.

Key non-tradable goods—local wages, local services, local housing—have seen essentially no price increases in yen terms and significant deflation in global currency terms since 2000. The affordability of rent (rent compared to wages) has barely moved. This is despite tradable goods and commodities being way up because of the currency’s depreciation. A decent boxed meal bought at a convenience store used to take 10 minutes of work to afford, now it’s 16 minutes (up 60%+)—around a 2% inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate for that item (in wage terms). And Japanese workers are more competitive than ever.

That said, Japan has seen dramatically lower *dollar* incomes, meaning purchases on imports are much more expensive. Using the most apples-to-apples comparison (dollar GDP per capita), individuals in Japan used to be richer than US individuals, now they are some 60% poorer. This is obvious to any Japanese person traveling abroad.

![](Attachments/1738246527114.png)

**For a different angle of who the winners and losers were, it’s helpful to take a look at how prices have changed in Japan at a very granular level because it provides a window into what it’s like to earn, spend, and save there. The table below provides a lot of details, but to summarize:**

- Since 2000, the yen is down 30%. If you were a US investor who kept their money in yen versus dollars earning the dollar interest rate, you’re down 84%.
- Your returns for holding unhedged Japanese bonds versus US bonds were slightly better (but still very bad, down roughly 70%) and slightly better (but still very bad) for unhedged Japanese equities versus US equities (down around 67%).
- Meanwhile, prices in Japan (aggregate CPI) are up 10%—much less than in the US, where prices are up 90%.
- At the same time, all fiat currencies have devalued versus goods. The dollar has depreciated about 50% in the last 24 years.
- **Whereas total average inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) is similar across major categories, the composition of inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) is very different. In Japan, there has been deflation in non-tradables** — **housing and labor especially** — **while prices of tradable goods (i.e., things you can purchase from abroad like electronics, toys, oil, etc.) have soared with some key tradable commodities up 3x+ in yen terms.**
- Non-tradables are about flat in price while tradable commodities are up 2-10x (average up 3x).

![](Attachments/1738246585652.png)

![](Attachments/1738246618082.png)

- All of this is largely the inverse of what happened in the lead-up to the bubble (1980-90), where overheating growth and strong capital inflows led to both significant non-tradables inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) (+40%) and yen strength (+70%). These changes reflect the changes in the big cycle in Japan.

The following charts convey the picture for a Japanese worker. As shown, in the past 25 years, typical worker wages were relatively flat in yen terms, just shy of 400,000 yen a month, but fell significantly in dollar and world currency terms. In other words, while the average Japanese worker used to make the equivalent of $3,500 a month, they now make about $2,500. In gold terms, they used to earn 13 ounces of gold equivalent a month; now it’s 1 ounce.

![](Attachments/1738246745911.png)

You can also see the impact by looking at some real prices of items that mix commodities with heavy doses of domestic labor. The data on costs of vehicles tends to wiggle a lot, but roughly speaking a domestically made car used to cost eight months of labor, and now it’s nine months. A convenience store boxed lunch used to take 10 minutes of work to afford, now it’s 16 minutes (up 60%+). Going to a theme park used to cost a third of a day of labor, now it’s a half a day.

![](Attachments/1738246853218.png)

![](Attachments/1738246862440.png)

The charts reflect the dramatic changes that took place and are likely to continue to take place due to the previously described typical mechanical process of the Big Debt Cycle in which the country has a lot of debt denominated in its own currency and it is a reserve currency country.

Remarkably during this period, there were no really big internal or external conflicts, though Japan is now preparing for war with China (though it doesn’t want it) as the United States’ most important ally in the region.

**How Did Japan Get Here?**

I want to highlight six dynamics at play in Japan that helped bring about these sets of winners and losers. Here is what happened:

1\. The government deficit spending floods the private sector with cash, aiding in private sector deleveraging.

2\. The central bank monetizes the debt to keep long rates low, lower debt service, and boost demand. Government debt burden ex-CB holdings begins to fall as a percent of GDP.

3\. And the resulting currency depreciation acts as a sort of tax on foreign investors holding unhedged domestic bonds and domestic investors who didn’t invest outside the country, while it lowers the government debt burden as that falls in value when measured in foreign FX and gold.

4\. Domestic savers are similarly taxed, though to a lesser degree because even, though their buying power abroad decreases, that fall in buying power isn’t as much domestically.

5\. The country gets more competitive, as both assets and factors of production get cheaper.

More specifically it happened in the following way.

**Dynamic 1: Public sector deficit spending floods private sector with cash, helping the private sector delever.**

The following chart shows that dynamic, with public sector debt rising from roughly 1990 to 2020, during the period of private sector deleveraging. After that government leveraging, Japan was left with the highest government debt levels of any major country. There are many historical cases of other governments struggling to deal with their debt burdens. Japan was able to manage it because of the second dynamic.

![](Attachments/1738246960690.png)

**Dynamic 2: The central bank monetizes the debt to keep long rates low, lower debt service, and boost demand. Government debt burden ex-CB holdings begins to fall as a percent of GDP.**

The following table shows how Japan’s debt service (interest and principal repayment) in yen effectively fell by around 7% during a period in which debts rose by nearly 30%. About half of that was because of lower interest rates (shown in the chart further below) and debt being termed out. The other half was because of BoJ purchases of the debt.

![](Attachments/1738247015074.png)

![](Attachments/1738247043910.png)

**Dynamic 3: And the resulting currency depreciation acts as a sort of tax on foreign investors holding unhedged domestic bonds and lowers the government debt burden in foreign FX and gold.**

BoJ actions significantly contributed to declines in the yen, as shown in the chart below.

![](Attachments/1738247094993.png)

This meant that holders of yen-denominated assets saw their holdings lose a significant amount of value. The charts below compare the returns of yen bonds to USD bonds, and yen currency to USD currency. In both cases, holders of yen lost more than half of the value. This is not dissimilar to a default.

![](Attachments/1738247124121.png)

This also has produced a deleveraging of Japanese government debt as measured in other currencies. Measured in dollars, debt service is down since 2001, a period with rapid government borrowing. Measured in gold, debt levels are down some 80%.

![](Attachments/1738247165801.png)

![](Attachments/1738247199035.png)

**Dynamic 4: Domestic savers are similarly taxed, though to a lesser degree because, even though their buying power abroad decreases, it’s not as bad domestically.**

We’ll look at this point through two lenses:

- Holders of Japanese government debt without the currency exposure have done OK, even while the assets have done quite badly in USD terms.

![](Attachments/1738247253952.png)

- Japanese households have seen muted inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) over the period (discussed in more depth above). The weak economy has kept the currency declines from translating into much domestic inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md).

![](Attachments/1738247314946.png)

**Dynamic 5: The country gets more competitive, as both assets and factors of production get cheaper.**

In the following charts, note how just about everything in Japan became much cheaper and how that attracted FDI inflows.

![](Attachments/1738247422431.png)

![](Attachments/1738247432320.png)

Asset valuations have mirrored this as well. Japan went from one of the more overvalued markets (at least as measured by imperfect statistics like P/Es) to inexpensive relative to the US.

**Japan’s Big Debt Cycle in Some Charts**

As with China, we’ll end this chapter with charts that are more zoomed out, which helps show the big cycle transpiring over many decades.

The first chart below shows Japan’s Big Debt Cycle in the form of the government’s debt-to-GDP ratio.md) going back to 1870; that way you can see two big cycles, though we will focus on the second.

![](Attachments/1738247659051.png)

The next chart shows the amount of central government debt service as a percent of the amount of revenue the government took in. In it you can see the debt busts that happened when it exceeded 150%, and you can see how, in recent years, it has risen toward—but stayed below—150%.

![](Attachments/1738247676009.png)

I will now shift to a post-1950 perspective. Through these charts, you can see how the last couple decades are best characterized by “pushing on a string,” with nominal rates falling below 0%, real rates a bit negative\[5\], large amounts of money printing, and the yield curve just slightly upward-sloping. Corporate spreads have stayed low (for perspective, as of this writing they are around 1% in the US and 0.6% in Japan for Baa-rated companies). All of these are characteristics of very stimulative monetary policy, especially in the last decade or so. Despite the stimulative policy, inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) has remained much lower than policy makers have generally desired, slipping in and out of deflation.

![](Attachments/1738247693051.png)

The highly stimulative policy comes with risks. So far, the BoJ has remained profitable: the bonds they’ve bought (with printed money) haven’t seen big sell-offs, and the interest they’ve had to pay on excess reserves has remained quite low (because of low short-term interest rates). But if rates rise, the BoJ will become significantly unprofitable, fast. That recently happened to the US Federal Reserve, producing moderate manageable losses—up to 0.5% GDP. But with the BoJ’s monetary base at around 5x the Fed’s, losses could be much more meaningful.

### Note: My Failure to Cover a Lot

**While it might seem like I covered a lot in this review of the period since 1945, what I left out was vastly greater than what I included. While I briefly looked at what happened in the United States, China, and Japan, I showed virtually nothing of what happened in the other great developed powers (e.g., European powers), Middle Eastern countries, and I barely mentioned most emerging countries, also known as the “Global South” (e.g., India, Africa, Latin America, Asia, and Oceania), which account for 85% of the world’s population. They all had and are having their Big Cycles. I am excited to say that with AI I am beginning to get my head around it all, and I have reason to believe that my digital self will evolve way beyond me to deal with these and communicate with you about them. By the way, if you are interested in communicating with my digital self, you can get Digital Ray** **here****.**

**Of the many countries I haven’t been able to mention, it is worth taking a moment to focus on rising countries with strong fundamentals (as reflected in my strength gauge that consists of 18 measures), like India; ASEAN countries such as Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam; the UAE; and Saudi Arabia, which have benefited by being neutral vis-à-vis the power conflicts.**A number of them are at take-off points in their developmental cycles because their people, governance systems, and capital markets are approaching being capable of competing in ways that didn’t previously exist. Also, the conflicts between the United States and China are making the United States and China less desirable, which is driving capital, businesses, and talented individuals to these places. If you want to look at them more closely, I recommend that you look at my Great Powers Indices that summarizes the conditions and prospects of the top 24 countries. They are available for free here.



## Chapter 15: What My Indicators Show

### My Indicators

**In making my assessments of risks, I weigh a number of factors, many of which I have described and the most important of which are shown in the following table. The table shows these indicators across major countries as of my writing this in January 2025.**Though they aren’t all of my indicators and they are not enough to convey the whole picture, they paint a good enough picture. Think of this table as a dashboard that paints a rough, current picture of health in order to assess central government and central bank long-term debt risks. In addition to showing risks from existing and projected debt and debt service levels, it includes measures of whether a country is a reserve currency because being a reserve currency country—i.e., having one’s currency widely accepted around the world as both a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth—is a great risk mitigator, especially if the country is a good place to invest, as is currently the case for the US and its money and debt.

By looking at the indicators in that table, you can get a pretty good picture of what a country’s debt risks are. You can see that the US has very large central government debts (which is a big risk) and low liquid savings/reserves (so it has little protection from them), but its currency is the dominant world reserve currency (which is a great mitigator of the risk), which the US is undermining by a number of things it is doing (which I won’t reiterate because it would be too much of a digression). From all this, you can see that its financial well-being hinges on it maintaining its existing reserve currency status. You can also see that the Japanese central government has very large debts (which is a big risk) that are denominated in its currency (which mitigates the risk) and relatively large FX reserves (which reduces the risk). You can see that China has relatively big debt (which is risky), its debt is denominated in its own currency (which is risk-mitigating), it has relatively big reserves (which is risk-mitigating), it has a currency that is not widely accepted around the world as a storehold of wealth (so there isn’t much support from that), and the attraction of and usage of its capital markets by foreign investors—while it was moderately large—is falling fast (which lessens the protection it would get from having more). You can also see that Singapore, Norway, and Saudi Arabia currently have good income statements and balance sheets that have much more in liquid assets than they have in debts, and you can get that sort of picture for the other countries shown.

![](Attachments/1739392550352.png)

**I aggregate indicators into models designed to show risks and rewards of things happening.**

### Long-Term and Short-Term Indicators of the Risks of Central Governments and Central Banks

**Using those and other previously described indicators, I measure both long-term risks (which I view like measuring the long-term risks of having a heart attack) and short-term risks (like measuring the heart attack actually happening and its damage) for both central governments and central banks. While short-term risks are often due to long-term vulnerabilities becoming manifest in problems (like a person with high long-term risks of having a heart attack actually having a heart attack), this isn’t always the case. For example, a pandemic (like COVID) could happen, or a war could break out, even if the underlying long-term vulnerabilities are low, which would lead to greater short-term risks that will show up in this risk gauge rising. My measures of both the long-term and the short-term risks are shown below. Please know that while these are good indicators, they, like most leading indicators of someone having a heart attack, are very imprecise for previously explained reasons.**

### The US Central Government’s Debt Risks

**The chart below on the left shows my measure of the US government’s long-term debt risks, and the one on the right shows my measure of the US government’s short-term risks going back to 1900. At this time, I judge the long-term risks of US government debt to be very high because the current and projected levels of US government debt and debt service, and sales of new debt and debt to be rolled over, are the highest ever and there are big debt rollover risks ahead. In fact, I judge the US government’s debt situation to be nearing the point of no return. By that, I mean that the debt and debt service levels are beyond those that can be reduced without great losses to debt investors because at such levels a self-reinforcing debt “death spiral” occurs due to the need to borrow to service debt and interest rates rising because the risks of holding the debt/currency become apparent. At the same time, I judge the short-term risks to be low because inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and growth are relatively moderate, credit spreads are low, real interest rates are high enough for lender-creditors without being too high for borrower-debtors, and the private sector’s income statements and balance sheets are in relatively good shape—good enough to tax if that is needed to help the central government’s finances. However, if the demand for new debt sales and debt rollovers falls off and/or there is the selling of debt assets, that would quickly raise the short-term risk gauge. By the way, this gauge can change very quickly—e.g., overnight.**

![](Attachments/1739392574245.png)

**Next is a table showing some of the most important readings that feed into my long-term risk rating for the US central government. It’s measured in Z-scores, or standard deviations above/below the mean. All you need to know is above 2 is quite bad.**

![](Attachments/1739392598155.png)

In short, it appears to me that there is a very high ***long-term*** risk of a US central government debt crisis of the sort I have been describing, but currently there is a very low ***imminent*** risk of that problem happening.

### The US Central Bank’s Debt Risks \[1\]

**The following charts show my gauges of the long-term and the short-term risks of the Federal Reserve. While the long-term risk gauge is now higher than it has almost ever been because a) the amounts of government debt held by the Fed are high, b) the losses taken by the Fed are the highest they have ever been, and c) the Fed has a poor net worth, these numbers are currently not large. So right now, the long-term risk is small but is in a place where it could accelerate very quickly. And, as of now, I measure the Fed’s short-term risks to be relatively low because the US economy and markets are near their equilibrium levels.**More specifically, while the reading is moderately bad relative to what it was in the past, owing to a large balance sheet with little hard assets to back it up (with limited cash flow losses), it is not yet significant because the numbers remain very manageable and are nowhere near the levels that proved to be problematic for central banks in other countries in which the central bank problem became severe and led to a self-reinforcing downward spiral. Also, a) neither high and quickly rising inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) nor deflation and falling prices are a problem, b) the Fed is not actively monetizing debts but rather is slowly shrinking its debt holdings, and c) the Fed isn’t encountering currency changes that are so large that they would affect inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and growth enough to affect its monetary policy.

**In fact, the US economy would at this moment in time appear to be in an excellent equilibrium level judging by its levels of growth, inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), real interest rates, and central bank debt monetizations, which can create the mistaken impression that all is now good.**But all is not good because there is the government debt supply and demand picture, which we’ve discussed, that is growing like a cancer, and the Fed’s existing balance sheet has losses that would rise, leading to its capital falling in a debt crisis.md). Besides increasing the financial risks, such a confluence of events would increase the risk to the Fed’s independence because the Fed’s actions would be put under greater political scrutiny, which, if confidence in the Fed’s independence is undermined, would likely contribute to a negative reinforcing cycle because the confidence in the value of money being maintained would be undermined. At this time, we are a relatively long way from that.**The two things that we should expect not to happen, but if we see them happen should be viewed as big red flags going up that are signaling that the real value of money and debt are at great risk, are 1) another round of quantitative easing to increase liquidity and force real interest rates down and 2) the central government gaining control over the central bank.**

**Next is a table showing some of the most important inputs to my long-term risk rating for the US central bank.**You can see that the central bank’s income statement looks not particularly bad, but the balance sheet looks about as vulnerable as it has ever been because of the large amount of money (74% of GDP) and the small amount of reserves (3% of GDP). The income statement doesn’t look bad because, while the central bank is unprofitable, the magnitude is relatively small.

Also, as shown in the table, the United States is the world’s dominant reserve currency, its capital markets are dominant, and the dollar has been a mediocre storehold of wealth. When I net these factors, we see the US as a good storehold of wealth, which reduces long-term risk.

Having said that, it should be noted that these supports can deteriorate very quickly as they did for prior world powers and their currencies. For a review of the declines of the British pound and the Dutch guilder before it, please reference my book *Principles for Dealing with the [Changing World Order*](https://www.amazon.com/Changing-World-Order-Nations-Succeed/dp/1982160276)*.*

Please keep in mind that these indicators only reflect the debt/financial part of the picture and not the complete picture, and that the other big forces will have a great impact on this picture as this picture will have a big impact on the other forces (e.g., the domestic conflict, the international conflict, the acts of nature, and the technology changes), so what we don’t know is very large relative to what we do know.

## Chapter 16: My 3%, 3-Part Solution

**This chapter is a quick and easy read for those who want to get the key points without spending too much time. It also provides thoughts and numbers that those who are analytical might want to spend some pondering, so I recommend it for everyone.**

**I want to make this clear and easy to remember. If you keep in mind the number 3, that will help you remember that:**

- **The budget deficit should be cut to 3% of GDP (from what it is currently projected to be by the CBO, about 6% of GDP), and**
- **These cuts can come from 3 sources (spending cuts, tax increases, and interest rate cuts, with interest rate cuts being the most impactful).**

**If the president and those in Congress agree that they need to do that, and they agree on a bipartisan backstop approach to doing that (I will suggest an option), they will achieve the goal of greatly reducing the odds of the US government going broke.**

**That’s it in nutshell. I will now explain.**

### The Picture as I See It

**It appears to me that:**

[^1]: **Policy makers who are working on getting the debt issue under control (some have given up on the idea) are approaching the problem from the bottom up, by which I mean by working on which spending cuts and/or which tax increases are better than others, rather than working from the top down, by which I mean by looking at how much it will take in total to meet the goal, then looking at the three big levers that government policy makers can pull to reduce the deficit (i.e., spending cuts, tax increases, and interest rate reductions), and finally deciding which spending cuts, which tax increases, and which interest rate changes to make.**
[^2]: **Policy makers are so tied up in arguing about the particulars to get exactly what they want that they have made the likelihood of a disastrous outcome—either not limiting the debt or having a bad government shutdown—much greater than the likelihood of an attainable good outcome.**

**To tackle this problem, I believe that they should 1) work from the top down, by which I mean agree on the size of the cuts to the deficit and the size of the deficit as a percentage of GDP that need to be made to stabilize the debt and 2) agree on a fallback plan that achieves the necessary budget cuts that would automatically happen if they can’t reach agreement on the particulars. This fallback plan could be something like equal percentage cuts to all spending that can be cut and equal percentage increases on all taxes that can be increased so that combined they will achieve the goal if they can’t agree on anything else, so they will be assured of having a deal. Then, they can go on to try to create a plan that they can agree is better than that one. I will now propose a fallback plan that policy makers should be able to agree on.**

**What My 3%, 3-Part Solution Looks Like**

**The following chart shows the US debt level as a percentage of government revenue. The current debt trajectory is shown with the red dashed line, and based on how I understand the mechanics to work and on indicators of what is most likely to happen, it appears to me that to prevent the central government from going broke, policy makers have to change the government debt level trajectory to the green dashed line. Changing that trajectory will require some cut in spending, and/or some increase in tax revenue, and/or some cut in the interest rate on the debt such that these three moves in total will add up to cut the deficit to bring it down to 3% of GDP. Such a deficit cut would lead to the debt burden being about 17% lower in 10 years than it would be if the US were to continue on its currently projected path (which amounts to debts being $9 trillion lower in 10 years). In 20 years, the 3% solution path would make government debt 31% lower, which is $26 trillion lower. Doing that would greatly reduce the risks of the central government, those who are lending to it, and all those who would also be affected by a big debt issue from suffering a “heart attack.”**

![](Attachments/1739392678243.png)

**In Chapter 3, I showed that there are three main types of levers that can be pulled to control the deficit, and I showed tables that conveyed the effects of pulling them. To achieve the goal of stabilizing debt relative to income, it would take about an 11% increase in taxes, about a 12% cut in spending, or about a 3% cut in interest rates, all else equal, if just one lever were used alone. Of course, any one of these numbers alone is way too large, so managing the adjustment will require a good combination of two or three of them.**

**Let’s look more closely at those numbers, which are interesting because they show how much more powerful a change in interest rates would be than a change in taxation.**For instance, interest rates falling by 1% is about four times more effective at reducing the debt-to-income ratio over the next 20 years than a 1% increase in tax revenue.**The numbers also show how much more powerful a change in taxation would be than a change in spending** —a 1% increase in tax revenue is 1.2x more effective than a 1% reduction in spending over that same time frame. But these estimates of the direct effects understate what the total effects are likely to be after accounting for the likely secondary effects. More specifically, a cut in interest rates is even more powerful than the estimate I gave you because, besides lowering government debt service payments, interest rate cuts would boost asset prices, which would raise capital gains tax receipts and be stimulative to the economy, and raise inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), which would raise tax revenues. It’s also worth noting that 1) the second-order effects of cutting spending would be negative for economic activity and thus negative for income taxes and 2) the second-order effects of raising taxes would also be negative because of the reduction in spending and economic growth.

**In other words, there are two important takeaways. First, the biggest influence on the government’s deficit is ironically not Congress, which determines spending and taxes—it is the Federal Reserve, which determines interest rates. Second, while trimming the budget deficit and cutting interest rates both reduce the debt problem, they would have offsetting effects on economic growth, inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), and taxes. This means that if these actions are balanced well, the budget deficit can be reduced significantly without creating unacceptable effects on the economy.**

Given that, if I were deciding for the president and/or Congress, I would want the Federal Reserve to lower the interest rate. I expect that the president and Congress will pressure the Fed to do that, but, of course, Congress and the president don’t determine what the Fed does.**If I were on the Federal Reserve board, I would be willing to work with the president and Congress to implement such a plan because a fiscal tightening** (which would have the first-order effects of reducing the deficit and being a negative for economic growth and inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)) **in conjunction with a monetary easing** (which would also be deficit-reducing while being positive for economic growth and inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)) **looks like a great plan. It is obvious that a fiscal tightening with a monetary easing would be a good thing.**In fact, if Congress and the president enacted a significant deficit reduction, it would trigger a rally in bonds and a decline in interest rates that would help reduce the deficit. Some people worry about a cut in the fiscal deficit of that size being too negative on the economy, but that’s not my worry because if the fiscal tightening were too negative on growth and inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), it would trigger a monetary easing to rectify that.**So, what’s the problem with cutting spending and raising taxes other than the political problem of anger from those who are getting less money from spending or who are paying more in taxes? I don’t see it.**

**A fiscal tightening with a monetary easing makes financial and economic sense because the biggest imbalance that now exists that should be rectified is between the central government’s finances (it has dangerously too much debt and too much borrowing) and the private sector’s finances (which are in relatively good shape, particularly in the booming areas of the market and the economy). This state of affairs came about because the Fed helped to fund the large budget deficits that allowed the big spending and the central government’s debt problem to happen in the first place. So, the Fed cooperating to negate whatever pain that might come as a result of a large (3% of GDP) deficit cut would make sense, especially since the private sector has received lots of deficit-funded support, is now in pretty good shape, and could use some fiscal tightening, which the Fed could help manage with its monetary policy. It would bring the private and public sectors’ finances into better balance.**

**Who would suffer from the lower interest rate? While bond holders will get a lower real yield, they would benefit from interest rates falling because bond prices would go up, plus they would get a safer bond. The world would celebrate such an accomplishment, both because of the reduced US government debt risk and because it would demonstrate that the American political system can work well to solve at least this big problem.**Also, other major markets like equities would benefit from those changes. So, just about everyone other than special interest groups should like the immediate effects of this plan.

**Let’s now play around with the numbers and these three levers to see what specific changes could get the 3% of GDP deficit goal achieved by making the adjustments come roughly equally from spending cuts, taxes, and interest rate cuts. That would take about a 4% cut in spending, a 4% increase in taxes, and a 1% cut in real interest rates. That way, they would spread out where they get the 3% of GDP from so it’s not too big for anyone, it is pretty politically agnostic, and the depressing fiscal effects would be offset by the stimulative monetary effects of the real interest rate cuts. That would be my solution to the problem with one possible modification: because those amounts of cuts in spending and increases in taxes would cause abrupt changes, I would phase these changes in over three years.**As mentioned, I would try to make that a bipartisan fallback position to use if no other solution is reached because everyone would be relieved if policy makers could agree on an acceptable plan and negotiate the tweaks to it.

### What If the Fed Doesn’t Go Along with This?

**Of course, the Fed can’t openly say that it will go along with this plan (though deals between the Fed keeping interest rates low while the government was cutting the deficit have been made in the past), so let’s look at the possibility that Congress and the president will have to make the changes come only from spending cuts and raising tax revenue by the same percentages. That percentage would be about 6% (i.e., cutting spending by 6% and raising taxes by 6%), which would also equal about a 3% of GDP deficit reduction.**While those amounts of adjustments would be large by historical standards, I know that they can occur without problems if balanced well and I know that if they are too depressing to economic growth, the Fed will respond by lowering interest rates because that’s what the central bank does when the economy and inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) are too depressed.**For these reasons I know that if this 3%, 3-part plan is followed it would be worlds better than if it is not followed.**

### My Proposed Deficit Cut Compared with Past Deficit Cuts

**While many will say that these changes are draconian, my study of past deficit cuts leads me to believe that they are very manageable if monetary policy is managed sensibly at the same time. Phasing in that plan and assuming the Fed will run monetary policy sensibly would lead to the adjustment looking something like what is shown in the red dashed line, which is very close to the original 3% plan.**

![](Attachments/1739392702884.png)

**However, I need to point out a fly in the ointment. As mentioned, the numbers I showed are based on the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office’s numbers. These numbers are based on the existing plan for the Trump tax cuts to roll off so, if they are extended as President Trump has promised to do, the deficit will be larger by an estimated 1.5% of GDP, so the deficit cut will have to be over 4% of GDP rather than about 3% to stabilize government debt-to-income.**

**While such a budget deficit cut is large, it’s not very large by historical standards. The following table lists all major fiscal policy tightenings in all countries going back to 1960. It shows that big fiscal tightenings (3% of GDP or even much larger) went well if put into place when 1) growth was strong, 2) the monetary-currency policy was easy, and 3) debts were in currencies that the central bank could print. Notably, the fiscal tightening in these cases helped to lower bond yields, which reduced interest costs on the debt and encouraged private sector activity that raised taxes, and to the extent the fiscal tightening weakened the economy more than desired, it led to monetary easings that negated the fiscal tightening effects on the economy. The most successful US case of cutting the budget deficit happened in the 1992-98 period, which took the deficit from 4% of GDP to a surplus of 1% of GDP (a 5%-of-GDP improvement) over those seven years, which would be like cutting the deficit by $1.5 trillion today. My plan would cut the deficit by much less than that amount.**

**My timeless and universal principle about this is:**

**When there are large government debts that are growing quickly so that large cuts to budget deficits are needed, the most important things to do are to 1) cut the deficit by enough to rectify the problem, 2) cut the deficit when economic conditions.md) are good so the cuts are counter-cyclical, and 3) have monetary policy be stimulative enough to keep the economy strong in the face of such cuts.**

### More Specifically, What Expenses Should Be Cut and What Taxes Should Be Raised?

**While I am tempted to get into what I believe are the relative merits of the different specific types of spending cuts, tax increases, and interest rate cuts, I’m not going to do that because I don’t think there is any reason that my preferences should matter.\[2\] It also would be too big of a digression and would lead to all sorts of arguing with all sorts of people who have different preferences. The problem of all sorts of people having all sorts of preferences that they will fight for and not being able to resolve their disagreements is to me the biggest problem that we face—i.e., as a country and a civilization which is that there is so much arguing over the exact ways to prevent the disaster that it won’t be prevented. That’s why I am recommending the equal and proportionate cut in spending and increase in taxes as the fallback plan if no other plan can happen. Then, once that is in place, as has been proposed in the past, they could authorize a bipartisan fiscal commission to examine the debt issue and propose specific alternatives that are preferable to the fallback plan. But frankly, I don’t care exactly how congressional policy makers do it nearly as much as I care that they do it.**

**Nonetheless, let’s look at the constraints that must be considered.**

**A selection of highly impactful potential spending cuts and tax increases and their impacts are shown in the following table. This is a list of items that came primarily from the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office that most policy makers refer to. Looking at that list tells me that tweaking existing spending programs and taxes in moderate, tolerable ways could achieve the 3% of GDP deficit goal without unacceptable pain. This list also shows the revenue that can be brought in by tariffs (which during many periods of history have been a greater source of government revenue than anything else). According to the CBO, 10% tariffs on all imports could bring in about 0.6% of GDP. Also, if Elon Musk’s claim that he can cut the budget deficit by $2 trillion is half true (i.e., if DOGE can cut the budget deficit by $1 trillion), that would be 3% of GDP. There are several other radical changes and considerations on the table so I’m confident that one way or another they can make it, and I like some of the aspirations as I’m all in favor of radically improving the efficiency of the government and the economy. So, it’s not hard for me to imagine how a pragmatic “grand bargain” between reasonable Republicans and Democrats could be reached. My only question is whether the people involved will operate together logically to do sensible things.**

**Now is the time for policy makers to put up or shut up. To be clear, whatever form of grand bargain cuts the deficit to about 3% of GDP is good with me. That leads me to conclude that** ***if our representatives in Washington don’t get a debt limit deal done, it will be because of their lack of reasonableness and their inability to compromise—not because a good, workable plan is beyond their reach. Because the failure to reach an agreement will produce a much bigger problem than reaching an agreement along the lines of my 3% solution, it seems to me that the electorate should hold their representatives in Congress accountable to get a debt limitation deal done.***

**In the following table are some of the choices and their effects on the budget deficit, which were put out for informational purposes mostly by the Congressional Budget Office. I am sharing them simply to convey a picture of the alternatives.**

![](Attachments/1739392766241.png)

**In considering which spending to cut, when one looks at the possibilities, one quickly notices that about 70% of the non-interest spending is considered “mandatory”—i.e., it is either contractually required or politically nearly impossible to cut. The breakdown is shown in the following chart.**

![](Attachments/1739392792635.png)

**That said, in the “mandatory” spending part of the budget, there are a number of relatively modest changes that could have big impacts. For instance, two changes to Social Security (phasing in an increase to the retirement age from 67 to 70 and using a more realistic inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) measure to calculate the increase in benefits), which wouldn’t affect virtually anyone immediately, would produce about a tenth of the required spending cuts.**

**The roughly 30% of spending that is “discretionary” that Congress has to reauthorize every year** (which is shrinking fast as a share of spending because entitlement programs are growing) **includes defense spending (which is over half of the discretionary budget), veteran medical care, rental assistance for low-income households, funding for transportation, medical and scientific research, education transfers to states,**and hundreds of other functions of the government.**Because a bill needs to be passed every year to authorize this spending, these are the easiest to cut (though they have not been cut). If you cut just from these “discretionary” items to achieve the goal of cutting spending by about 4%, that would require 15% cuts in these on average. I find the distinction between discretionary and non-discretionary spending to be a bit arbitrary because cuts can be made from both. The important thing is getting to a reasonable mix that adds up to a deficit reduction of 3% of GDP to get the deficit down to 3% of GDP.**

### Do It Now! Do It Counter-Cyclically!

**To re-emphasize: When there are large government debts that are growing quickly so that large cuts to budget deficits are needed, the most important things to do are to 1) cut the deficit by enough to rectify the problem, 2) cut the deficit when economic conditions.md) are good so the cuts are counter-cyclical, and 3) have monetary policy be stimulative enough to keep the economy strong.**

**Now is an exceptionally good time to implement a significant debt limit plan because:**

- It is much better to reduce government deficits in good economic times than to wait for a debt crisis.md) to happen in bad times.
- The US economy is near full employment, growth is moderately strong, inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) is a bit high, and the private sector’s income statements and balance sheets are in pretty good shape (mostly because the government took on the burden, which it probably should shift at least some of back).
- If the plan is not implemented now, the debt problem will grow so it will be more difficult to deal with. That is especially true because the debt cycle is now at the stage in which borrowing and more debt are needed to service existing debts, so they are increasing in a self-reinforcing and compounding way.

Implementing this plan now would be a confidence booster that would have all sorts of beneficial knock-on effects.**It’s also worth noting that there are other, less-commonly discussed ideas out there that could have a big impact on the debt picture. I’m in favor of marking the government’s assets to market, creating a US government sovereign wealth fund, and exploring a US-backed stablecoin if these things can be done well. Imagine if the government’s assets were managed economically—e.g., if they were valued, bought, sold, and/or developed economically rather than not even looked at economically as is the case now, and imagine there was a well-funded, well-run sovereign wealth fund behind the government’s financing and debt. That’s an interesting subject for another time.**

**In concluding this chapter, I want to reiterate that even with the best of budget plans, there are very big uncertainties that can throw them off.**For example, we don’t know if there will be wars that will cost more and worsen the budget deficits, or if there will be bigger-than-expected productivity gains from new technologies that will produce higher incomes and tax revenues that will reduce budget deficits. There are many such uncertainties that will undoubtedly disrupt these projections, so the ranges of possibilities around them are large.**To me, that suggests that US policy makers should be more, not less, conservative in dealing with the government’s finances because the worst thing possible would be to have its finances in bad shape during difficult times.**

## Appendix to Chapter 16: Looking in More Detail at the Effects of Different Spending, Tax, and Interest Rate Changes on the Deficit in the US

Achieving the goal of stabilizing government debts relative to government revenues is kind of like playing with a Rubik’s Cube, in that changing one lever changes the impact of all the others. The following tables show how different combinations of government spending cuts, tax increases, and interest rate changes would lead to different outcomes for the government’s debt-to-income ratio.

**The first table shows the status quo—what the US government debt picture looks like in 20 years if there are no changes in revenue, spending, or real interest rates from those now projected by the Congressional Budget Office.**In that baseline scenario, US government debt will reach over 130% of GDP in 20 years. However, it’s important when doing these calculations to compare debt levels to tax revenue, not nominal GDP. GDP is often used by default, but that can be misleading because levels and changes in tax revenue can be very different from levels and changes in GDP. When dealing with government finances, what matters are the revenues and expenses of the government. Translating this projection into a share of government revenue, the US is projected to reach debt that is 7.2x government income, up from about 5.8x right now.

**To give you a sense of how the different pieces interact, I show in the following table how this projection would change as the government changes its spending** (x-axis, with spending declining as you move to the right) and/or revenues (y-axis, with taxes rising as you move down).**This grid shows how challenging it is to stabilize the debt if lower real rates are not part of the solution—it requires relatively large cuts in spending and increases in revenue.**

![](Attachments/1739393023481.png)

In the following tables, I show the same sensitivity if real interest rates fell by 1% or 2% (i.e., if they end up roughly 1.5-2.5% below real growth rates). These grids help you see the impact of different policy mixes.

![](Attachments/1739393039032.png)

The following table shows how much of each lever you’d need to pull on its own. For instance, just cutting discretionary spending would require nearly 50% cuts to those programs, while just cutting interest rates on the government debt would require them to fall by around 3%. That’s why I like my “3% solution”—because it spreads the adjustments across the levers.
