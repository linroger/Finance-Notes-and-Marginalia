# Chapter 6: The Crisis Spills over to the Central Bank (Stages 5-6)

## When Central Banks Step Into the Breach

As our journey through the archetype of a debt crisis.md) continues, we arrive at the pivotal moment when financial pressures intensify to the point that central banks can no longer remain on the sidelines. Like firefighters responding to a growing blaze, central banks rush in when conventional financial mechanisms begin to falter.

**Stage 5: The Central Bank's Dilemma**

Picture this scenario: interest rates have bottomed out at or near zero, yet the pressure on governmental and systemic debt continues to mount relentlessly. The central bank, faced with limited options, turns to its most powerful tool—creating money to purchase bonds. Though we often speak of "printing money," the reality is more nuanced. The central bank effectively borrows reserves from commercial banks, paying short-term interest rates on these borrowed funds.

By this point, the government faces a stark reality: it needs substantially more financing for essential spending priorities, yet finds itself confronted with borrowing rates that exceed what it can sustainably afford. This financial squeeze often results from mechanical selling of currency and debt instruments as market participants rush for safety. With traditional avenues of funding becoming increasingly difficult to access, the government inevitably turns to its central bank for support, transferring the problem to this institution of last resort.

Historical patterns reveal that during such periods, central banks typically expand money and credit supply dramatically to purchase government bonds. While I consider this development a warning sign, it doesn't yet signal imminent disaster. Central banks possess considerable power to control money and credit production, especially when dealing with central government debt. Nevertheless, the financial vise continues to tighten if deficits persist, as escalating debt burdens divert increasingly larger portions of government spending toward debt service. We'll examine the specific state of U.S. government finances in later sections.

When the central bank steps into this breach, it alleviates pressure on government finances (or other systemically vital entities) either through direct asset purchases or indirectly via guarantees and backstops. The central bank frequently incurs losses on these assets—purchased at prices that may prove uneconomical—through some combination of default, inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), or rising interest rates. This process effectively transfers balance sheet damage from the government to the central bank and, ultimately, to holders of the currency.

**The Supply-Demand Dilemma for Government Debt**

When demand for government debt becomes insufficient, central banks face a critical choice between two unappealing options:

[^1]: Allow interest rates to rise sufficiently to balance supply and demand, which would curtail both credit demand and spending throughout the economy
    
[^2]: Create money to purchase debt assets, expanding the central bank's balance sheet through quantitative easing
    

If these patterns persist, they should be viewed as early warning signs of potential trouble ahead. Similarly, when governments begin shortening the maturities of their debt—typically because long-term debt finds insufficient demand—this too signals early-stage trouble. The combination of rising total debt and increasing central bank holdings of government debt represents yet another warning sign.

As illustrated in the charts below, these trends—central banks buying more bonds and governments shortening debt maturities—typically begin almost a decade before a full-blown crisis emerges, and reverse only after the crisis has passed. Notice particularly how central bank bond purchases accelerate while government debt maturities rapidly contract.

In a healthy financial system, the appetite to borrow from debtors and the willingness to lend by creditors remain in balance. However, when free-market demand for debt weakens, central governments and their central banks assume more debt that the private sector cannot or will not absorb. Governments can step in where private actors fear to tread because lender-creditors more readily trust government debt during periods of stress, backed as it is by the central bank's ability to create money. The primary risk shifts from default to inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)—the possibility that the central bank will produce excessive money and credit to prevent defaults, devaluing the currency and making repayment in depreciated money a significant concern for lenders.

When this dynamic emerges, I view it as a warning sign, though not yet a severe one. History demonstrates that such imbalances can persist for extended periods before supply and demand disparities become truly problematic. This pattern began in 2008, previously termed "debt monetization" and more recently labeled "quantitative easing." In the United States, quantitative easing occurred in four waves, ultimately amounting to 18% of potential GDP, 5% of total debt, and 16% of government debt. Europe saw similar waves totaling 30% of potential GDP, 10% of total debt, and 36% of government debt. In Japan, three waves reached 95% of potential GDP, 22% of total debt, and 46% of government debt.

**Central Banks and Risk**

When central banks purchase bonds, they expose themselves to the same risks that commercial banks and investors face, differing only in their unique powers to create money for debt monetization and to account for losses in less transparent ways.

The mechanics work as follows: when a central bank buys a bond from a commercial bank, it credits that bank with a new deposit at the central bank. The central bank pays interest on this deposit, similar to how commercial banks pay interest on customer deposits. Just as commercial banks can face difficulties when the interest earned on their assets falls below what they pay on deposits, central banks encounter the same problem. If interest rates on these central bank deposits exceed the rates earned on the bonds they hold, the central bank experiences losses and negative cash flow. Using mark-to-market accounting would reveal losses on their bond holdings and, if these losses exceed their capital, could result in negative net worth—though at this stage, few observers express concern about this possibility.

**Stage 6: The Central Bank's Spiral**

As interest rates climb, central banks begin losing money when the interest they must pay on liabilities exceeds what they earn on their bond holdings. While noteworthy, this development doesn't yet constitute a major red flag until the central bank accumulates significant negative net worth and must create additional money to cover its negative cash flow. This signals a dangerous inflection point—the beginning of a potential "death spiral" wherein rising interest rates trigger problems that make creditors reluctant to hold debt assets, pushing rates even higher or forcing more money creation that devalues the currency, leading to additional selling of debt and currency, and so on.

This self-reinforcing cycle represents what I mean by a central bank "going broke." Though technically the central bank doesn't default on its obligations (it can always create more money), excessive money creation devalues the currency, potentially triggering inflationary recessions or even depressions.

At this juncture, the central bank finds itself in an exceedingly difficult position, caught between conflicting imperatives: maintaining monetary policy loose enough to support a struggling economy and fiscally constrained government, while simultaneously keeping it tight enough to prevent investors from abandoning the currency. This classic hallmark of an unsustainable situation typically manifests in several ways:

**Central Banks with Red Ink**

After accumulating substantial debt and witnessing rising interest rates that drive down bond prices, central banks often discover their short-term funding costs exceed returns on acquired debt. This mismatch creates significant losses, potentially so large that central banks develop negative net worth—another warning sign, though not yet terminal.

These accumulating red flags don't necessarily signal the immediate end of the Big Debt Cycle—they merely indicate the deteriorating financial health of the system. The cycle continues because central banks retain their capacity to create money and credit to fund operations and losses. In some jurisdictions where governments prioritize sound finances, the central government may be required to recapitalize the central bank, creating additional pressure as the government must secure capital through taxation, spending cuts, or additional borrowing—further intensifying the financial squeeze.

When central banks accumulate substantial debt, they effectively reduce the debt's value by diminishing the worth of the currency that these debt assets promise to deliver. And when short-term interest rates they must pay exceed the long-term interest earned from their debt assets, central banks incur losses and potentially negative net worth. While initially a moderate concern—several central banks today operate with negative equity without significant operational impediment—larger losses could initiate a spiral with far-reaching consequences.

The advantage of central banks purchasing such debt lies in: 1) providing credit that wouldn't otherwise exist, keeping interest rates lower than market forces would determine, and 2) absorbing losses that would otherwise fall on private investors when interest rates rise and bond values decline. This raises the question of whether central bank losses truly matter and, if so, why. While central bank losses certainly matter less than private sector losses and don't immediately impact creditworthiness, substantial central bank losses signal progression toward later stages of the Big Debt Cycle—a mid-cycle warning flag.

Small or moderate losses typically don't threaten crisis, as central banks can absorb them. However, as losses grow from modest to substantial, they can create cash flow demands that require significant money creation, placing downward pressure on the currency. The central bank accrues mounting interest expenses on its liabilities (attempting to retain savers' confidence in the currency) while earning little on its assets (supporting the government), ultimately creating money to bridge this gap. The table below documents historical instances where these cash flow losses grew so substantial that they necessitated extensive monetization, contributing to currency spirals:

**The Monetization Imperative**

Facing these circumstances, the central bank eventually must create money to monetize its losses and others' losses, despite worsening pressure on the currency. This can occur explicitly through direct asset purchases or indirectly through guarantees and backstops. The central bank typically absorbs losses on these assets—often acquired at unfavorable prices—through defaults, inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), or rising interest rates, transferring balance sheet damage from the government to the central bank and currency holders.

Key indicators of this stage include:

- **Expanding central bank balance sheets** as money creation finances government operations or rolls over stressed entities' debts. The left chart below shows central bank purchases of government bonds, though central bank interventions can extend much further—potentially including private assets like corporate bonds or equities. These measures may also encompass guarantees and backstops for struggling borrowers that don't appear on balance sheets but still represent transfers of purchasing power as central banks and governments assume responsibility for covering losses (examples include the Emergency Banking Act of 1933 and the Bank of Amsterdam's backstopping of the Dutch East India Company, both eventually requiring monetization).

- **Reserve sales** as central banks defend currencies while simultaneously providing liquidity to needy entities. Consequently, central bank asset compositions shift from hard assets (gold and foreign exchange reserves) to softer claims (government or financial sector obligations). This contributes to currency runs (particularly with pegged currencies) as investors witness rapidly depleting resources for currency defense, forcing central banks to accelerate reserve sales until defense becomes unsustainable. This dynamic intensifies significantly in fixed exchange rate regimes.
    
- **Monetization combined with reserve sales** causes the ratio of central bank hard assets (reserves) to liabilities (money) to decline, weakening the ability to defend the currency. Again, the distinction between fixed and floating exchange rates proves significant. Countries with pegged currencies typically maintain more backed money supplies but encounter problems sooner when reserve-to-money ratios decline. They also tend to expend more reserves during currency defense phases of the cycle.

# Chapter 7: The Prior Big Debt Crisis Recedes, a New Equilibrium Is Reached, and a New Cycle Can Begin (Stages 7-9)

## Finding Balance: How Debt Cycles Reach Resolution

As we approach the conclusion of our examination of debt crises, we turn to how these tumultuous periods eventually resolve. The cycle culminates when a combination of market forces and policy interventions creates a bottom from which recovery can begin. This chapter explores the dynamics and indicators I watch for during these final stages (Stages 7-9 of our archetype from Chapter 4).

**Stage 7: The Great Rebalancing**

When debt burdens become unsustainable, a significant restructuring and/or devaluation must occur to reduce their size and value—either through natural market forces or carefully orchestrated intervention.

In the most skillfully managed scenarios—what I term a "beautiful deleveraging"—deflationary debt-reduction methods (like debt restructuring) are counterbalanced with inflationary approaches (such as monetization), allowing deleveraging without excessive deflation or inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md).

The currency typically devalues substantially, imposing significant real-term losses on those holding the currency and debt instruments. This loss of purchasing power continues until authorities establish a new monetary system with sufficient credibility to attract investors and savers back to the currency. This generally involves substantial debt write-downs and restructuring.

**The Flight to Real Assets**

During these turbulent periods, government debts typically devalue dramatically relative to tangible assets like gold, stocks, and commodities. In contemporary contexts, digital currencies such as Bitcoin might also benefit from this dynamic. The charts below illustrate the average devaluation of currencies and debts compared to: 1) gold, 2) commodities, and 3) equities.

On average, gold outperforms local debt instruments by approximately 60% from the onset of devaluation until the currency bottoms out. Notice the striking difference in outcomes between fixed exchange rate systems and variable (fiat) currency regimes.

The table below presents individual returns across various asset classes for each case study:

**Finding Bottom: Painful but Necessary**

When debts undergo restructuring and/or devaluation, markets and economies typically experience severe distress. Yet this painful period ultimately reduces debt burdens and lays the foundation for eventual recovery. In the archetypal case, debt levels rise significantly relative to monetary bases before crises, requiring the private sector to absorb increasing government debt with unchanged quantities of base money—contributing to the initial upward pressure on interest rates observed in many cases. Eventually, when pressures become unsustainable, central banks intervene with debt monetization, expanding monetary bases and reducing debt-to-money ratios.

**The Reserve-to-Debt Ratio Dance**

Typically, reserves fall relative to debts during early crisis stages—initially because debt levels rise rapidly, then because reserves are depleted defending currencies. After policy makers abandon currency defense efforts, this ratio improves as currency devaluation mechanically reduces local currency debt values relative to hard currency assets and enhances national competitiveness, helping countries earn more in hard currency terms.

![](Attachments/1737571542351.png)

The chart below illustrates how government debt and monetary base trajectories typically align. Government debt usually rises first (often responding to earlier crises) while money growth remains largely unchanged (and may even slow when central banks attempt currency defense). Governments typically implement various control mechanisms, such as foreign exchange restrictions or managed exchange rates (sometimes establishing official rates that diverge from market rates). These controls often create market distortions that prove more harmful than beneficial. After central banks surrender currency defense efforts, money creation accelerates, generating inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) that improves governments' nominal revenues relative to their debts. This pattern appears consistently across both pegged and floating exchange rate regimes.

![](Attachments/1737571553967.png)

The next three charts compare government debt against reserves; declining reserve-to-debt ratios primarily result from rising government debt, though selling reserves late in the cycle to defend currencies also contributes. After selling ceases and currencies devalue, ratios typically improve as devaluation reduces local currency government debt values relative to remaining hard currency assets.

**Stage 8: Extraordinary Measures Under Extraordinary Circumstances**

During acute fiscal distress, cash-strapped governments typically raise taxes to address financing shortfalls. The prospect of increased taxation further pressures households and businesses to move assets outside the country. In response, governments often implement capital controls to stem these outflows, though by this point economic pressure to abandon the country and currency often proves too powerful to contain.

The charts below present various perspectives on tax rate trends across case studies. Note that both marginal income tax rates for top earners and inheritance tax rates increased by approximately 10% during the years preceding devaluations.[1]

![](Attachments/1737571625356.png)

Higher tax rates typically accompany capital controls designed to prevent capital flight. The table below demonstrates the prevalence of this pattern:

![](Attachments/1737571640237.png) [2]

**Stage 9: Finding Sustainable Balance**

The deleveraging process inevitably reduces debt burdens, creating conditions for a return to equilibrium. Often, during inflationary depressions that devalue debt, governments ultimately raise reserves through asset sales and engineer transitions from rapidly declining currencies to relatively stable ones. This typically involves linking currencies to hard currencies or assets (like gold), implemented by central banks maintaining tight monetary policies and high real interest rates that severely penalize borrowers while rewarding lenders, encouraging currency and debt purchases that stabilize these instruments.

By this stage, the currency has devalued substantially, and remaining currency and debt holders have absorbed significant real-term losses, which has alleviated much of the debtors' burden. With reduced debt levels, restoring stability requires less backing. When managed effectively, governments bolster reserves—sometimes through government-owned asset sales, sometimes through IMF or other loans that mandate sound financial policies, including austerity measures. Interest rates remain elevated—substantially higher than prospective inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rates and currency depreciation rates—allowing central banks to make debt instruments attractive investments again, while making debt in the local currency prohibitively expensive if policies are well-executed.

This phase establishes a new, more stable monetary system with sufficient credibility to attract investors and savers back to the currency. This typically follows substantial debt write-downs and restructuring, along with returning to some form of hard money (such as gold pegs or linkage to stable currencies). These transitions generally require fundamental adjustments improving national balance sheets and income statements.

**The Five Steps to Monetary Stability**

The classic transition typically requires these five essential steps:

[^1]: **Restructuring debts to manageable levels** where reserve assets can cover a substantial portion of liabilities and government debt service no longer exceeds revenue growth. This usually requires defaulting on and restructuring both foreign and some local currency debts.

![](Attachments/1737571660010.png)

![](Attachments/1737571673608.png) [3]

The two charts below analyze what happens to government debt-to-GDP ratios following devaluations, averaged across our case studies. In typical cases, central government debt reached 89% of GDP around devaluation time. Green bars represent factors reducing debt-to-GDP ratios—on average, central bank purchases contributed 7%, inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) 38%, real GDP growth 26%, primary surpluses 16%, and defaults or debt restructuring 8%. The red bar shows what increased debt—76% from continued interest payments. Net result: debt typically falls from 89% to 70% of GDP, with rising inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and real growth (stimulated by aggressive policies) primarily driving debt burden reduction.

In other words, governments with debt denominated in their own currencies typically: 1) made interest and principal payments by having central banks create money and credit, raise inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), and stimulate real growth, while restructuring debts to increase nominal income growth relative to debt service obligations, and 2) restructured defaulted debts in the proportions shown. While these represent average figures with considerable variation, the underlying patterns remain remarkably consistent.

![](Attachments/1737571699045.png)

[^2]: **Implementing profound fiscal adjustments** to create sustainable government finances without requiring money creation to monetize debt. These deep, painful fiscal reforms from central governments typically accompany healthy balance of payments adjustments. Primary deficits usually improve before governments can reduce interest costs by refinancing at lower rates.

![](Attachments/1737571712145.png)

[^3]: **Securing sufficient reserves to defend the currency** (or back new currencies replacing collapsed ones) represents another crucial step. Currency devaluation assists this process by increasing reserve values relative to nominal liabilities and improving competitiveness, thereby enhancing export revenues compared to import costs. Additionally, governments often build reserves through asset sales and occasionally borrow from official creditors (among the few willing lenders at this stage). Governments frequently privatize state-owned enterprises and other assets, generating reserve funds while improving operational efficiencies.

[^4]: **Maintaining high real interest rates** that amply compensate investors for currency-holding risks. The charts below show nominal interest rates on local and hard currency debts.

[^5]: **Establishing constraints on central bank actions** that might undermine new monetary stability.

**The Birth of Opportunity**

When these conditions converge, they create some of the most favorable environments for holding a country's currency and debt.

This concludes our examination of the typical Big Debt Cycle's final stages. Now let's zoom out once more to the broadest perspective and examine how this Big Debt Cycle has unfolded over the past eight decades.
