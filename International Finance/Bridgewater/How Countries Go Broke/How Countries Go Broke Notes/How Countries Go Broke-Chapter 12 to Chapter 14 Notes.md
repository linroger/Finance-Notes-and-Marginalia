# Chapter 12: The History and Lessons from Phase 4, Since 2020—Pandemic and Big Fiscal Deficits Monetized (MP4)

The COVID pandemic of 2020 catalyzed a profound shift in monetary policy that I designate as Monetary Policy 4 (MP4). Despite longstanding principles in the US and many nations dictating that monetary policy should operate independently from fiscal policy—specifically to prevent the politicization and devaluation of currency—every sacrosanct rule eventually confronts reality and succumbs to pragmatic necessities as the Big Cycle progresses. MP4 represents this inevitable convergence: coordinated actions between central government and central bank, with governments running substantial deficits that central banks subsequently monetize.

This dynamic emerges when traditional tools—interest rate adjustments (MP2) and quantitative easing (MP3)—prove insufficient to ameliorate economic conditions.md) for the majority population, and when market capitalism fails to distribute capital equitably. The free-market system inherently channels resources toward the financially advantaged—those holding assets and possessing borrowing capacity—while neglecting those with the greatest needs and vulnerabilities. This precise phenomenon materialized in 2008. The COVID pandemic necessitated more than mere monetary expansion; it demanded targeted distribution to specific individuals and organizations.

Throughout economic history, MP4 has manifested under similar conditions: acute economic distress coupled with pronounced wealth disparities that render interest rate adjustments or quantitative easing alone inadequate. This pattern typically emerges in the late stages of long-term debt cycles. In our current case, MP4 materialized in two substantial waves.
