# Part 2: The Archetypical Sequence Leading to Central Governments and Central Banks Going Broke

_Throughout history, central governments and central banks have repeatedly followed similar paths to financial ruin—a pattern that remains insufficiently understood despite its recurrence. This section illuminates this archetypical sequence, offering a comprehensive template of the typical case alongside analysis of the two principal variants: (1) crises involving debt denominated in currencies the country's central bank can print, and (2) those involving debt denominated in currencies beyond the central bank's printing capacity. After establishing this foundational framework, Part 3 will examine how the current Big Cycle, from 1944 to the present, has unfolded relative to this timeless template._

## Chapter 4: The Archetypical Sequence

**My examination of 65 major debt crises over the last century—with particular focus on 35 cases where central governments and/or central banks became insolvent—has yielded a comprehensive understanding of these systemic failures. What follows is the archetypical process, delving into the granular mechanics of events both preceding and following governmental financial collapse. While this section provides crucial detailed insights into how the template manifests in actual economic dynamics, readers seeking a more concise overview may focus on the bolded text and determine whether to explore the nuances further.**

Before exploring the typical sequence, we must first understand a critical factor that fundamentally shapes how these crises unfold: the distinction between hard money and fiat money systems.

### Hard Money Versus Fiat Money

**Debt crises throughout history manifest in two fundamental variants with distinct behavioral patterns. The first type—hard currency cases—occurs when governments commit to delivering money they cannot create themselves (gold, silver, or another relatively stable currency like the dollar). Historically, when acquiring these hard currencies to servic
