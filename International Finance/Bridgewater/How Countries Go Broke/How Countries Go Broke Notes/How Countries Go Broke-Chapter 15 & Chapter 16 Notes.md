I'll rewrite the chapters in a more engaging and clearer manner while preserving all the details, illustrating economic chains with mermaid diagrams, and maintaining the markdown formatting.

# Chapter 15: What My Indicators Show

## My Indicators

In assessing financial risks, I employ numerous factors, with the most crucial ones displayed in the table below. These indicators, measured across major countries as of January 2025, provide a solid foundation for evaluating central government and central bank long-term debt risks. While not comprehensive, they paint a sufficiently accurate picture of each country's financial health. Consider this table a dashboard that captures the current state of financial well-being, allowing us to evaluate risks stemming from existing and projected debt and debt service levels. The table also indicates whether a country possesses reserve currency status—a significant risk mitigator, especially when the country represents an attractive investment destination, as is currently the case for the US and its financial instruments.

By examining these indicators, you can gain a clear understanding of each country's debt risks. The United States faces substantial central government debts (a major risk) coupled with low liquid savings/reserves (offering minimal protection), yet benefits considerably from its dominant world reserve currency status (a powerful risk mitigator). However, various US policies are gradually undermining this advantage. From this analysis, it becomes evident that America's financial well-being hinges critically on maintaining its existing reserve currency status.

Japan's central government carries massive debts (a significant risk), but these are denominated in its own currency (reducing the risk) and supported by relatively substantial foreign exchange reserves (further mitigating risk).

China faces relatively large debt (a risk factor), denominated in its own currency (risk-mitigating), backed by significant reserves (also risk-mitigating), but lacks a currency
