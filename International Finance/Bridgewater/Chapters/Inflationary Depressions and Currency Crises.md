# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises

## ****Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises

In the previous section,  we looked at the archetypal [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|deflationary debt crisis]],  which we created by averaging the 21 deflationary cycles you can review in Part 3. We will now look at the archetypal [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|inflationary debt crisis]],  which we created by averaging the 27 worst cases of inflationary cycles \(also shown in Part 3\). After reviewing this template,  I encourage you to read about the hyperinflation in Germany’s [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Weimar Republic]],  which is examined in depth in Part 2,  to compare it to the archetypal case described here. Before we turn to the charts and other data,  please remember that:

- [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] and debt serve two purposes: to be 1\) [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|mediums of exchange]] and 2\) [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|store holds of wealth]]
- Debt is one person’s asset and another’s liability
- Debt is a promise to pay in a certain type of [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] \(e.g.,  dollars,  euro,  yen,  pesos,  etc.\)
- Holders of debt assets expect to convert them into money and then into goods and services down the road,  so they are very conscious of the rate of its loss of purchasing power \(i.e.,  [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]]\) relative to the compensation \(i.e.,  the interest rate\) they get for holding it
- Central banks can only produce the type of money and credit that they control \(e.g.,  [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] makes dollar denominated money and credit,  the BoJ makes Japanese yen money and credit,  etc.\)
- Through a [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|symbiotic relationship]],  over time central banks and free-market borrowers and lenders typically create bigger and bigger piles of debt assets and debt liabilities
- The bigger the pile,  the greater the challenge for central bankers to balance the opposing pressures so the pile doesn’t topple over into a deflationary depression in one direction or an inflationary depression in the other
- [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Policy makers]] \(those who control monetary and fiscal policies\) can usually balance these opposing forces in debt crises because they have a lot of power to redistribute the burdens so they are spread out,  though they can’t always balance them well
- Central banks typically relieve debt crises by “printing” a lot of the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] in which the debt is denominated,  which,  while stimulating spending on [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] assets and the economy,  also cheapens the value of the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] \(all else being equal\)
- If a [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] falls in relation to another [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] at a rate that is greater than the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]’s interest rate,  the holder of the debt in the weakening [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] will lose money. If investors expect that weakness to continue without being compensated with higher [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]],  a dangerous [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|currency dynamic]] will develop.

That last dynamic,  i.e.,  the [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|currency dynamic]],  is what produces inflationary depressions. Holders of debt denominated in the poorly returning [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] are motivated to sell it and move their assets into another [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] or a non-[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] store hold of wealth like gold. When there is a [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007–2011)|debt crisis]] and economic weakness in a country,  it is typically impossible for the central bank to raise [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] enough to compensate for the [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|currency weakness]],  so the money leaves that country and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] for safer countries. When so much money leaves the country that [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|lending dries up]],  the central bank is faced with the choice of letting the [[Credit Markets Session 1|credit markets]] tighten or [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|printing money]],  which produces a lot of it. While it is widely known that central banks manage the trade-offs between [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] and growth by changing [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] and [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] in the system,  what is not widely known is that the central bank’s trade-offs between [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] and growth are easier to manage when money is flowing into a country’s [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]/debt and more difficult to manage when it’s flowing out. That’s because if there is more demand for the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]/debt,  that will push the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]/debt prices up,  which,  all else being equal,  will push [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] down and growth up \(assuming the central bank keeps the amount of money and credit steady\); when there is less demand,  the reverse will happen. How much changing demand there is for a country’s [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]/debt will create changes in the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] versus changes in [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] will depend on how the central bank moves its levers—which I’ll cover below. For now,  suffice it to say that in times when money is flowing out of a [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  [[Real Interest Rates and Aggregate Production|real interest rates]] need to rise less if real exchange rates fall more \(and vice versa\).

Capital outflows tend to happen when an environment is inhospitable \(e.g.,  because debt,  economic,  and/or political problems exist\),  and they typically weaken the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] a lot. To make matters worse,  those who fund their activities in the country that has the weaker [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] by borrowing the stronger [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] see their debt costs soar; that drives down the weaker [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] relative to the stronger one even more. For these reasons,  **countries with the worst debt problems,  a lot of debt denominated in a foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  and a high dependence on foreign capital typically have significant [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] weaknesses. The [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|currency weakness]] is what causes [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] when there is a depression.**

Normally this all runs its course when the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] and the debt prices go down enough to make them very cheap. More specifically,  the squeeze ends when a\) the debts are defaulted on and/or enough money is created to alleviate the squeeze,  b\) the [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] requirements are reduced in some other way \(e.g.,  forbearance\) and/or c\) the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] depreciates much more than [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] picks up,  so that the country’s assets and the items it sells to the world become so competitively priced that its [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] improves. But a lot depends on politics. If the markets are allowed to run their courses,  the adjustments eventually take place and the problems are resolved,  but if the politics get so bad that productivity is thrown into a self-reinforcing downward spiral,  that spiral can go on for a long time.

### Which Countries/Currencies Are Most Vulnerable to Severe Inflationary Deleveragings or Hyperinflations?

While inflationary depressions are possible in all countries/currencies,  they are far more likely in countries that:

- *Don’t have a reserve [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]* \(so there is not a global bias to hold their [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]/debt as a store hold of wealth\)
- *Have low foreign-exchange reserves* \(the cushion to protect against capital outflows is small\)
- *Have a large foreign debt* \(so there is a vulnerability to the cost of the debt rising via increases in either [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] or the value of the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] the debtor has to deliver,  or a shortage of the availability of dollar denominated credit\)
- *Have a large and increasing budget and/or [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deficit* \(causing the need to borrow or print money to fund the deficits\)
- *Have negative [[Real Interest Rates and Aggregate Production|real interest rates]]* \(i.e.,  [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] that are significantly less than [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] rates\),  therefore inadequately compensating lenders for holding the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]/debt
- *Have a history of high [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] and negative total [[Assets|returns]] in the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]* \(increasing lack of trust in the value of the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]/debt\)

Generally speaking,  the greater the degree to which these things exist,  the greater the degree of the inflationary depression. The most iconic case is the German [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Weimar Republic]] in the early 1920s,  which is examined at length in Part 2. If you are interested in reviewing actual case studies showing the reasons why inflationary depressions happen rather than deflationary ones,  it is worth noting the differences between the Weimar case study and the US [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment 1928-1937|Great Depression]] and 2007–2011 case studies,  which are also examined in Part 2.

Can reserve-[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] countries that don’t have significant foreign-[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] debt have inflationary depressions? While they are much less likely to have inflationary contractions that are as severe,  they can have inflationary depressions,  though they emerge more slowly and later in the deleveraging process,  after a sustained and repeated overuse of stimulation to reverse deflationary deleveraging. Any country,  including one with a reserve [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  can experience some movement out of its [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  which changes the severity of the trade-off between [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] and growth described earlier. If a reserve-[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] country permits much higher [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] in order to keep growth stronger by printing lots of money,  it can further undermine demand for its [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  erode its [[How Countries Go Broke-Chapter 15 & Chapter 16|reserve currency status]] \(e.g.,  make investors view it as less of a store hold of wealth\),  and turn its deleveraging into an inflationary one.

## ****The Phases of the Classic Inflationary Debt Cycle

Classically,  inflationary deleveragings follow the ebbs and flows of money and credit through five stages that mirror the stages of deflationary deleveragings,  but that are different in important ways. Over the past few decades I have navigated through a number of inflationary deleveragings and researched many more. They transpire pretty much as deflationary deleveragings do up until the fourth stage,  the depression.

I’ll begin this section with a look at the stages of the archetypal inflationary deleveraging,  just as I did in the prior section. \(This archetype was created by averaging 27 inflationary deleveragings in which there was a lot of debt denominated in foreign currencies.\) Then I’ll compare the archetype to four specific hyperinflationary cases in order to highlight their differences.

### 1\) The Early Part of the Cycle

In the healthy upswing,  favorable [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] are a result of good [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|fundamentals]]—i.e.,  because the country is [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] and there is potential for productive [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]. At this point,  debt levels are low,  and balance sheets are healthy. That stimulates export sales and hence foreign capital,  which funds investments that produce good [[Assets|returns]] and yield productive growth.

Capital flows—both within countries and among them—are typically the most important flows to watch because they are the most volatile. As the cycle begins,  debt and incomes rise at comparable rates and both [[Class Note 1- Borrower-Lender conflicts and implied agency problems|debt and equity]] markets are strong,  which encourages investing,  often with borrowed money. The private sector,  government,  and banks start to borrow,  which makes sense for them because incomes are rising quickly,  making it easier to service the debt. These strong [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|fundamentals]] and early levering up set the country up for a boom that in turn attracts more capital.

The positive,  self-reinforcing cycle is enhanced when the demand for the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] is improving. If the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] is cheap enough to offer attractive opportunities to foreign investors \(who will typically lend to or invest in entities that can produce inexpensively in that country and sell into export markets to earn the foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to provide them with a good return\),  and/or the country sells more to foreigners than it buys from them,  a country’s [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] will become favorable—i.e.,  the demand for its [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] will be greater than its supply. This makes the central bank’s job easier—i.e.,  it can get more growth per unit of [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]]—because the positive inflows can be used to appreciate the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  to lower [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]],  and/or to increase reserves,  depending on how the central bank chooses to handle it.

At these times of early [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] strength,  some central banks choose to enter the foreign-[[Currency Swap Basics|currency exchange]] market to sell their own [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] for the incoming foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] in order to prevent it from rising \(and to prevent the adverse economic effects of its rise\). If the central bank does this,  it needs to do something with that newly acquired [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  which is to buy [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] assets denominated in that foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] \(most typically bonds\) and put them in an account called “foreign-exchange reserves.” Foreign-exchange reserves are like savings: They can be used to bridge imbalances between the amount of [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] demanded and the amount supplied by the free market in order to cushion the movements of the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] markets. They can also be used to purchase assets that might be desirable investments or offer strategic [[Assets|returns]]. The process of accumulating reserves is stimulative to the economy because it lessens the upward pressure on their own [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  which allows a country to maintain stronger export competitiveness and puts more money in the economy. Since central banks need to create more money to buy the foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  doing that increases the amount of domestic [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] funds to either buy assets \(causing asset prices to rise\) or lend out.

At this juncture,  the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]’s total return will be attractive because either a\) those who want to buy what the country has to offer need to sell their own [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] and buy the local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] or b\) the central bank will increase the supply of its own [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] and sell it for the foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  which will make the country’s assets go up when measured in its own [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]. So,  during this time when a country has a favorable [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]],  there is a net inflow of money that leads to the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] appreciating and/or the foreign-exchange reserves increasing. This influx of money stimulates the economy and causes that country’s markets to rise. Those invested in the country make money from the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] return \(through a combination of [[The Foreign Exchange Market Annotations|currency price]] changes and asset return differences\) and/or the asset appreciation. The more the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] appreciates,  the less assets will appreciate.

### 2\) The Bubble

The bubble emerges in the midst of a self-reinforcing virtuous cycle of strong [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]],  good [[Some Stylized Empirical Facts About Asset Retur|asset returns]],  and strong [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007–2011)|economic conditions]]. The capital that came in during the early upswing produced good [[Assets|returns]],  as it was invested productively and led to [[A Preview of Alternative Formulations|asset price]] appreciation,  which attracted even more capital. In the bubble phase,  the prices of the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] and/or the assets get bid up and increasingly financed by debt,  making the prices of these investments too high to produce adequate [[Assets|returns]],  but the borrowing and buying continues because prices are rising,  and so debts rise rapidly relative to incomes.

When there is a big wave of money coming into \(and/or staying in\) a country/[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  typically the exchange rate is strong,  foreign-exchange reserves increase,  and the economy booms—or in some cases the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] rises a lot and the economy grows more slowly. This upswing tends to be self-reinforcing until it is so overdone that it reverses. It is self-reinforcing because the inflows drive up the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  making it desirable to hold assets denominated in it \(and desirable to hold liabilities denominated in other currencies\),  and/or produce more money creation that causes prices to rise more.

In either case,  during these bubbles the total [[Assets|returns]] of these assets to foreigners \(i.e.,  asset prices in local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] plus the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] appreciation\) are very attractive. That plus that country’s hot economic activity encourage more foreign inflows and fewer domestic outflows. Over time,  the country becomes the hot place to invest,  and its assets become overbought so debt and stock-market bubbles emerge. Investors believe the country’s assets are a fabulous treasure to own and that anyone not in the country is missing out. Investors who were never involved with the market rush in. When the market gets fully long,  leveraged,  and overpriced,  it becomes ripe for a reversal. In the bullets here and in the ones that follow,  we show some key economic developments typically seen as the bubble inflates.

- Foreign [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] are high \(on average *around* 10 percent of GDP\)
- The central bank is accumulating foreign-exchange reserves
- The real FX is bid up and becomes overvalued on a purchasing power parity \(PPP\) basis by around 15 percent
- Stocks rally \(on average by over 20 percent for several years into their peak\)

All sorts of entities build up structurally long [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] positions because there is constant reward for doing that. Most participants are motivated to be long the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] of the country that is enjoying a sustained wave of [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] into it—though they often find themselves in this position without explicitly taking it on or fully recognizing it. For example,  foreign businesses that set up operations in the hot country might fund their activities with their own [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] \(to keep the liability in the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] that they expect will be weaker\),  but they might prefer to hold their deposits in the local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  and they might not hedge the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] exposures that come from the revenues of sales in that country. Similarly,  local businesses might borrow in the weaker foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  which the foreign bankers are eager to lend because the market is hot. There are lots of different ways that a sustained bull market will lead to multinational entities getting long that local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].

- The influx of foreign capital finances a boom in consumption
- Imports rise faster than exports,  and the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] worsens

Meanwhile,  [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] in the country creates strong growth and rising incomes,  which make borrowers in the country more creditworthy,  and make them more willing to borrow at the same time that lenders are more willing to lend to them. High export prices,  usually for [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|commodities]],  increase the country’s income and incentivize [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]].

As the bubble emerges,  there are fewer productive investments,  and at the same time there is more capital going after them. The fundamental attractiveness of the country that sparked the boom fades,  in part because the rising [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] is eroding the country’s competitiveness.

During this stage,  growth is increasingly financed by debt rather than productivity gains,  and the country typically becomes highly reliant on foreign financing. This shows up in foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] denominated debt rising. These emerging countries typically borrow primarily from abroad with debts denominated in foreign currencies because of a combination of factors—including the local [[Contemporary Financial Intermediation Notes|financial system]] not being well developed,  less faith in lending in the local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  and a smaller stock of domestic savings available to be lent out. Asset prices rise,  and the economy is strong. This creates both higher levels of spending in the economy and higher levels of obligations to pay in foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] in order to make debt-service payments. As with all debt cycles,  the positive effects come first and the negative effects come later.

- Debt burdens rise fast. Debt to GDP rises at an annual rate of about 10 percent over three years.
- Foreign-[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] debt rises \(on average to around 35 percent of total debt and to around 45 percent of GDP\).
- Typically,  the level of economic activity \(i.e.,  the GDP gap\) is very strong and growth is well above potential,  leading to tight capacity \(as reflected in a GDP gap of around \+4 percent\).

The charts below convey what happens to debt and the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] in the average of the 27 inflationary deleveraging cases \(which we call the “archetype”\). Just as I did with the deflationary deleveraging archetype charts,  I highlight each of the stages \(with the “zero” point on the charts representing the top in economic activity\). Classically,  during the bubble,  debt as a percentage of GDP rises from around 125 percent to about 150 percent,  and the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deteriorates by about 2 percent of GDP.

During the bubble,  the gap between the country’s income and its spending widens. The country requires an increasing inflow of capital to drive continued growth in spending. But levels of economic activity can remain strong at the top of the cycle only as long as continued inflows,  motivated by [[FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE|expectations]] of continued high growth,  drive up asset prices and cause the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to strengthen further. At this point,  the country is increasingly fragile and even a minor event can trigger a reversal.

Below we summarize the conditions through the upswings that led to the 27 inflationary deleveragings we looked at. We break out the cases with higher and lower levels of foreign-denominated debt and the cases that eventually had the least and most extreme economic outcomes \(as measured by most severe declines in growth and equity prices and increases in unemployment and [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]]\). As you will see,  the countries that were most externally reliant through the upswing and experienced the biggest asset bubbles ultimately experienced the most painful outcomes.

### 3\) The Top and Currency Defense

The top-reversal/[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]-defense occurs when the bubble bursts—i.e.,  when the flows that caused the bubble and the high prices of the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] level,  the high asset prices and the high debt growth rates finally become unsustainable. This sets in motion a mirror-opposite cycle from what we saw in the upswing,  in which weakening capital inflows and weakening asset prices cause deteriorating [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007–2011)|economic conditions]],  which in turn cause [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] and asset prices to weaken further. This spiral sends the country into a **[[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] crisis and an inflationary depression**.

Because at the top people are so invested in the optimistic scenario,  and because that optimism is reflected in the prices,  even a minor event can trigger a slowing of foreign capital inflows and an increase in domestic capital outflows. Though worsening trade balances typically play a role \(usually because of the high [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] level and excessive domestic consumption that led to high imports\),  adverse shifts in [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] are usually more important.

The circumstances that could set off such a crisis are akin to what might set off financial difficulties for a family or individual—a loss of income or credit tightening,  a big increase in costs \(such as rising gasoline or heating oil prices\),  or having borrowed so much that repayment becomes difficult. Any one of these shocks would create a gap between the amount of money coming in and the amount of money being spent,  which has to be closed somehow.

In the typical cycle,  the crisis arises because the unsustainable pace of capital that drove the bubble slows,  but in many cases,  there is some sort of a shock \(like a decline in oil prices for an oil producer\). Generally the causes of the top-reversal fall into a few categories:

1. 1\) *The income from selling goods and services to foreigners drops* \(e.g.,  the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] has risen to a point where it’s made the country’s exports expensive; commodity-exporting countries may suffer from a fall in [[Primary vs. Secondary Commodities|commodity prices]]\).
1. 2\) *The costs of items bought from abroad or the cost of borrowing rises*.
1. 3\) *Declines in [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] coming into the country* \(e.g.,  foreign investors reduce their net lending or net [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] into the country\). This occurs because:
1. a\) The unsustainable pace naturally slows,
1. b\) Something leads to greater worries about economic or political conditions,  or
1. c\) *A tightening of [[Lecture 7-[[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds|Risk and Return]] of Bonds#7.6 [[A Preview of Alternative Formulations|Asset price]] reactions to [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] surprises|[[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]]]] in the local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] and/or in the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] those debts are denominated in* \(or in some cases,  tightening abroad creates pressure for foreign capital to pull out of the country\).
1. 4\) A country’s own citizens or companies *want to get their money out* of their country/[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].

Weakening [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] are often the first shoe to drop in a [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] crisis. They directly cause growth to weaken because the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] and consumption they had been financing is reduced. This makes domestic borrowers seem less creditworthy,  which makes foreigners less willing to lend and provide capital. So,  the weakening is self-reinforcing.

- Growth slows relative to potential as the pace of capital inflows slows.
- Domestic capital outflows pick up a bit.
- Export earnings fall,  due to falling prices or falling quantities sold. Typically exports are flat,  no longer rising.

The shift in capital and income flows drives asset prices down and [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] up,  slowing the economic growth rates that were dependent on the inflows. This worsens the [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|fundamentals]] of companies and further drives out [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]]. The economy suffers a debt bust—asset prices fall and banks fail.

During this stage,  worry increases on the part of both asset/[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] holders and the [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]] who are trying to support the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]. Asset/[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] holders typically worry that [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]] will impose restrictions on their ability to get their money out of the country,  which encourages them to get their money out while they still can,  which further increases the [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] problem. [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Policy makers]] worry about capital outflows and the possibility of a [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] collapse. As the [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] deteriorate,  the central bank’s job becomes more difficult—i.e.,  it gets less economic growth per unit of [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] because the negative flows lead the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to depreciate,  [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] to rise,  and/or reserves to decline,  depending on how the central bank chooses to handle it.

At this stage,  central banks typically try to defend their currencies by a\) filling the [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] deficit by spending down reserves and/or b\) raising rates. These [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] defenses and managed [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines rarely work because the selling of reserves and/or the raising of [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] creates more of an opportunity for sellers,  while it doesn’t move the currencies and [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] to the levels that they need to be to bring about sustainable [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007–2011)|economic conditions]]. Let’s look at this typical defense and why it fails.

There is a critical relationship between a\) the interest rate difference and b\) the spot/forward [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] relationship. The amount the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] is expected to decline is priced into how much less the [[Forward Contracts and Forward Prices|forward price]] is below the spot price. For example,  if the market expects the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to fall by 5 percent over a year,  it will need that [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to yield a 5 percent higher interest rate. The math is even starker when depreciation is expected over short periods of time. If the market expects a 5 percent depreciation over a month,  than it will need that [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to yield a 5 percent higher interest rate over that month—and a 5 percent monthly interest is equivalent to an [[Continuously Compounding Interest|annual interest rate]] of about 80 percent10—a level that’s likely to produce a very severe economic contraction in an already weak economy. Because a small expected [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]] \(say 5 to 10 percent in a year\) would equal a large interest rate premium \(5 to 10 percent per year higher\),  this path is intolerable.

Said differently,  a managed [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] decline accompanied by falling reserves causes the market to expect continued future [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]],  which pushes up domestic [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] \(as described above\),  acting as a tightening at a time when the economy is already weak. Also,  the expectation of continued devaluation will encourage increased capital withdrawals and devaluation speculation,  widening the [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] gap and forcing the central bank to spend down more reserves to defend the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] \(or abandon the planned gradual depreciation\). Also,  a [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] defense by spending reserves will have to stop because no sensible policy maker will want to run out of such “savings.” In such [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] defenses,  [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]]—especially those defending a peg—will typically make boldly confident statements vowing to stop the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] from weakening. All of these things classically happen just before the cycle moves to its next stage,  which is letting the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] go.

It is typical during the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] defense to see the forward [[The Foreign Exchange Market Annotations|currency price]] decline ahead of the spot price. This is a consequence of the relationship between the interest rate differential and the spot/forward [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] that I discussed above. To the extent that the country tightens [[Lecture 7-[[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds|Risk and Return]] of Bonds#7.6 [[A Preview of Alternative Formulations|Asset price]] reactions to [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] surprises|[[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]]]] to try to support the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  they are just increasing the interest rate differential to artificially hold up the spot [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]. While this supports the spot,  the forward will continue to decline relative to it. As a result,  what you see is essentially a whip-like effect,  where the forward tends to lead the spot downward as the interest rate differential increases. The spot then eventually catches up after the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] is let go,  and [[The Fall of Bear Stearns Lost Opportunities Haunt Final Days of Bear Stearns; Executives Bickeredover Raising Cash Cutting Mortgages|the fall]] in the [[Arbitrage Opportunity Accounting|spot exchange rate]] allows the interest differential to narrow,  which mechanically causes the forward to rally relative to the spot.

At this point in the cycle,  capital controls are a third \(often last ditch\) lever that seldom works. They can seem attractive to [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]],  since they directly cause fewer people to take their capital out of the country. But history shows that they usually fail because a\) investors find ways to get around them and b\) because the very act of trying to trap people leads them to want to escape. The inability to get one’s money out of a country is analogous to one’s inability to get one’s money out of a bank: fear of it can lead to a run. Still,  capital controls sometimes can be a temporary fix,  though in no case are they a sustained fix.

Usually,  this [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] defense phase of the cycle is relatively brief,  in the vicinity of six months,  with reserves drawn down about 10 to 20 percent before the defense is abandoned.

### ****4\) The Depression \(Often When the Currency Is Let Go\)

As mentioned above,  a country’s inflationary deleveraging is analogous to what happens when a family has trouble making payments—with one major difference. Unlike a family,  a country can change the amount of [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] that exists,  and hence,  its value. That creates an important lever for countries to manage [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] pressures,  and it’s why the world doesn’t have one global [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]. Changing the value of the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] changes the price of a country’s goods and services for foreigners at a different rate than it does for its citizens. Think about it this way: if a family’s breadwinner lost his/her job and would have to take a 30 percent pay cut to get a new one,  that would have a devastating economic effect on the family. But when a country devalues its [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] by 30 percent,  that paycut becomes a 30 percent pay cut only relative to the rest of the world; the wages in the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] the family cares about stay the same. In other words,  [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines allow countries to offer price cuts to the rest of the world \(helping to bring in more business\) without producing domestic deflation.

So after supporting the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] in unsustainable ways \(i.e.,  expending reserves,  tightening [[Lecture 7-[[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds|Risk and Return]] of Bonds#7.6 [[A Preview of Alternative Formulations|Asset price]] reactions to [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] surprises|[[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]]]],  making very strong assurances that there will not be a devaluation of the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  and sometimes imposing foreign exchange controls\),  [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]] typically stop fighting and let the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] decline \(though they generally try to smooth its fall\).

Here is what we typically see after [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]] let the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] go:

- The [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] has a big initial depreciation,  on average declining around 30 percent in real terms
- The decline in the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] is not offset by tighter short rates,  so that the losses from holding the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] are significant \(on average,  around 30 percent in the first year\)
- Because the decline is very severe,  [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]] try to smooth it,  leading them to continue to spend down reserves \(on average,  by another 10 percent for a year into the bust\)

Central banks should not defend their currencies to the point of letting their reserves get too low or their [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] too high relative to what is good for the economy because the dangers those conditions pose are greater than the dangers of devaluation. In fact,  devaluations are stimulative for the economy and markets,  which is helpful during the economic contraction. The [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] decline tends to cause assets to rise in value measured in that weakened [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  stimulate export sales,  and help the [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] adjustment by bringing spending back in line with income. It also lowers imports \(by making them more expensive\),  which favors domestic producers,  makes assets in that [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] more competitively priced and attractive,  creates better profit margins for exported goods,  and sets the stage for the country to earn more income from abroad \(through cheaper and more [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] exports\).

But [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines are double-edged swords; how [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]] manage them greatly impacts the amount of pain the economy must endure during the adjustment. The nature of the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] decline greatly impacts how much [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] increases and how the inflationary depression plays out. In all inflationary depressions,  [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|currency weakness]] translates to higher prices for imported goods,  much of which is passed on to consumers,  resulting in a sharp rise in [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]]. A gradual and persistent [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] decline causes the market to expect continued future [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]],  which can encourage increased capital withdrawal and speculation,  widening the [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] gap. A continual devaluation also makes [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] more persistent,  feeding an [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] psychology.

That’s why it’s generally better to have a large,  one-off devaluation that gets the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to a level where there’s a two-way market for it \(i.e.,  where there isn’t broad expectation that the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] will continue to weaken so people are both buying and selling it\). This means higher [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] is less likely to be sustained. And if the one-off devaluation isn’t expected by the market \(i.e.,  it’s a surprise\),  then [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]] won’t have to spend reserves and/or allow [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] to rise to defend the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] going into the devaluation. This is why [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]] generally say they’ll continue to defend the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] right up until the moment they stop doing it.

After [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]] first let the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] go—stinging savers and creating [[FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE|expectations]]/fears of further devaluation—people push to get out of their positions in the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]. Many people had likely acquired big asset-liability mismatches,  taken on because they were profitable at the time. That makes the reversal self-sustaining,  because when the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] weakens,  the mismatches all of a sudden go from being profitable to unprofitable.

When the capital is no longer available,  the spending is forced to stop. Even those who aren’t borrowing from abroad are impacted. Since one person’s spending is another person’s income,  the effects ripple through the economy,  causing job losses and still less spending. Growth grinds to a halt. Lenders,  especially domestic banks,  have debt problems. Foreigners become even less willing to lend and provide capital.

- Typically capital inflows dry up,  falling fast \(by more than 5 percent of GDP in less than 12 months\)
- Capital outflows continue \(at a pace of -3 to -5 percent of GDP\)

Typically the pullback in capital is not offset much by the central bank [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|printing money]],  as printing risks enabling more people to get out of the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  worsening capital flight. Weaker growth causes investors to pull their money out anyway; the assets that had been seen as a fabulous treasure a short time ago now look like trash. They quickly go from overbought to oversold and prices plummet.

- Nominal short rates rise \(typically by about 20 percentage points\) and the yield curve inverts.
- Printing is limited \(1 to 2 percent of GDP,  on average\).
- Equities in local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] terms fall *\(on average by around 50%\)*. They perform even worse in foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] terms,  as the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] decline exacerbates the equity sell-off.

One of the most important asset/liability mismatches is foreign-denominated debt. As their local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] depreciates,  debtors who owe foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] debt face a rising debt burden \(in local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]\). There is not much that borrowers can do,  so they typically sell local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to pay back debts,  put on hedges,  and move more savings into foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  all of which contributes further to the cycle of downward pressure on the local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].

- [[Notes on Currency Swaps|Debt service]] rises further \(on average by more than 5 percent of GDP\) because incomes fall and foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]-denominated [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] becomes higher when measured in local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  further squeezing incomes and spending.
- FX debt burdens rise on those who borrowed in foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] \(debt-to-GDP rises on average by about 20 percent from the decline in incomes and the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]\).

The [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines also push up [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] as imports become more expensive.

- [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|Inflation]] rises \(typically by 15 percent,  peaking around 30 percent\).
- [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|Inflation]] stays elevated for a while,  on average for about two years from the top.

During this phase,  the pendulum swings from most everything looking great to most everything looking terrible. Different types of problems—debt,  economic,  political,  [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  etc.—reinforce each other. Hidden problems like fraudulent accounting and corruption typically come to the surface during such times. This bad environment discourages foreign money from coming in and encourages domestic investors to get their money out of the country.

This is when countries usually “hit the bottom.” The bottom is the mirror opposite of the bubble stage. While investors during the bubble are aggressively getting in,  investors during the catharsis are aggressively getting out. Those losing money in asset and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] positions flee from them in a panic; those who had been thinking of getting in don’t want to go near the place—so a big supply/demand imbalance occurs in which a shortage of buyers and surplus of sellers drive prices lower. This is the most severe and painful part of inflationary deleveraging,  as the downward spiral is self-reinforcing and rapid. “Hitting bottom” is typically so painful that it produces a radical metamorphosis in [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] and policies that ultimately produces the changes that are needed to turn things around. That is why I use the word “catharsis” when describing hitting bottom. In theater \(or for that matter,  in one’s own personal life\) crisis sows the seeds for change and ultimately renewal.

Because the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] has become very cheap,  spending on imports is finally cut substantially enough to restore the [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]]. That—plus,  sometimes,  international aid \(e.g.,  from the IMF,  BIS,  and/or other multinational organizations\)—creates the necessary adjustments. Often there are big political shifts,  from those who had been pursuing fundamentally bad policies to those who will pursue economically sound ones.

Here are some key economic developments that characterize this phase:

- The level of economic activity \(GDP gap\) falls a lot \(on average by about 8 percent\)
- Unemployment rises
- The bottom in activity comes after about one year,  with the trough in the GDP gap typically near -4 percent

### 5\) Normalization

The reversal and eventual return to normalcy comes when there is a balance between the supply and the demand for the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] relative to those of other currencies. While this balance is partially made via trade adjustments,  it is typically more determined by [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]],  so it primarily comes when the central bank succeeds in making it desirable to hold the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] again,  and secondarily when spending and imports have fallen sufficiently to bring about an adjustment in the [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]].

So how can [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]] keep capital in the country by making it desirable to be long—encouraging people to lend and save in the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] and not to borrow in it? Most importantly,  they need to produce a positive total return for the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] at an acceptable interest rate \(i.e.,  at an interest rate that isn’t too high for domestic conditions\). While most people,  including most [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]],  think that the best thing they can do is defend the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] during the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] defense phase,  actually the opposite is true,  because a [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] level a\) that is good for the trade balance,  b\) that produces a positive total return,  and that c\) has an interest rate that is appropriate for domestic conditions,  is a low one.

As explained earlier,  the best way to bring that about is to let the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] depreciate sharply and quickly. While that will hurt those who are long that [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  it will make it more attractive for investors who will get long after the devaluation,  because the total return on holding the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] \(i.e.,  the spot [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] appreciation plus the interest rate difference\) is more likely to be positive,  and at a sharply depreciated [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] level it won’t take an intolerably high interest rate to make the total return attractive. In other words,  the best way to ensure that investors expect positive total [[Assets|returns]] going forward at a relatively low real interest rate \(which is what the weak domestic conditions need\) is to depreciate the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] enough

Both the [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|fundamentals]] and the central bank’s willingness to control “money printing” and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] depreciations will determine whether the total return of the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] \(i.e.,  the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] changes plus interest rate differences\) will be positive or negative,  which will influence the willingness to own or be short the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]. Devaluing currencies is like using cocaine,  in that it provides short-term stimulation but is ruinous when abused. It’s very important to watch what central banks do before you decide whether or not it’s prudent to take a [[Chapter 4 - Futures: Hedging and Speculation|long position]]. If investors are burned with negative [[Assets|returns]] for too long and the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] keeps falling,  that’s frequently the break-point that determines if you’re going to have an inflationary spiral or not. The central bank’s objective should be to allow the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to get cheap enough that it can provide the needed stimulation for the economy and the [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]],  while running a tight enough policy to make the [[Assets|returns]] of owning the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] attractive. As you can see in the chart below,  [[Assets|returns]] to holding the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] for foreigners start out negative,  but then rally about a year after the devaluation.

Even if the country as a whole hasn’t hit its debt limits,  frequently,  certain entities within the country have,  and [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]] must recapitalize systemically important institutions and provide [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] in a targeted way to manage bad debts. By providing this targeted [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] \(typically by [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|printing money]]\) where needed,  they can help avoid a [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007–2011)|debt crisis]] that could be contractionary or could cause additional rounds of capital flight,  but the inflationary nature of this money printing needs to be balanced carefully.

Here is what we typically see when the country reaches the bottom:

- The collapse in imports improves the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] a lot \(on average by about 8 percent of GDP\).
- Capital inflows stop declining and stabilize.
- Capital flight abates.
- Frequently,  the country turns to the IMF or other international entities for support and a stable source of capital,  especially when its reserves are limited.
- Short rates start to come down after about a year,  but long rates continue to stay relatively elevated. After peaking,  short rates fall back to their pre-crisis levels in around two years. The decline in short rates is stimulative.
- As [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] come down,  the forward [[The Foreign Exchange Market Annotations|currency price]] rallies relative to the spot.
- As the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] stabilizes,  [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] comes down. Usually it takes nearly two years after the bottom for [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] to reach pre-crisis levels.

Of course,  these are all averages,  and the actual amounts depend on each country’s particular circumstances \(which we will look at in the next section\).

The sizable and painful decline in domestic conditions also helps to close the [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] gap by bringing down spending and imports. Through the crisis,  the average country’s imports contract by around 10 percent as growth collapses and the equity market falls by over 50 percent. Classically,  the collapse in imports brings the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] into a surplus of 2 percent of GDP,  rising from a deficit of -6 percent of GDP about 18 months into the crisis. In the earlier stages of the crisis exports play a smaller role; they actually tend to contract during the worst of the crisis \(as other countries are sometimes seeing economic slowdowns too\). They rebound in the subsequent years.

Below,  we provide a summary of what well-managed and poorly managed versions of these adjustments looks like.

**Well-Managed**

**Poorly Managed**

**Managing the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]]**

- [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Policy makers]] bluff,  conveying that they will never allow the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to weaken much. When they do devalue,  it’s a surprise.
- The devaluation is large enough that the people are no longer broadly expecting the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] weakening more \(creating a two-way market\).
- [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Policy makers]] are widely expected to allow a [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|currency weakness]],  causing more downward pressure on the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] and higher [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]].
- The initial devaluation is small,  and further devaluations are needed. The market expects this,  causing higher [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] and [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] [[FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE|expectations]].

**Closing External Imbalances**

- Tight [[Lecture 7-[[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds|Risk and Return]] of Bonds#7.6 [[A Preview of Alternative Formulations|Asset price]] reactions to [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] surprises|[[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]]]] causes domestic demand to contract in line with [[The Fall of Bear Stearns Lost Opportunities Haunt Final Days of Bear Stearns; Executives Bickeredover Raising Cash Cutting Mortgages|the fall]] in incomes.
- [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Policy makers]] create incentives for investors to stay in the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] \(i.e.,  higher [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] that compensate for risk of [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]]\).
- [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Policy makers]] favor domestic conditions,  and [[Lecture 7-[[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds|Risk and Return]] of Bonds#7.6 [[A Preview of Alternative Formulations|Asset price]] reactions to [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] surprises|[[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]]]] is too loose,  putting off domestic pain and stoking [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]].
- [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Policy makers]] attempt to stop the outflow of capital with capital controls or other restrictive measures.

**Smoothing the Downturn**

- Use reserves judiciously to smooth the withdrawal of foreign capital while working to close imbalances.
- Rely on reserve sales to maintain higher levels of spending.

**Managing Bad Debts/Defaults**

- Work through debts of entities that are over-indebted,  making up the gap with credit elsewhere.
- Allow disorderly defaults that lead to increased uncertainty and capital flight.

Typically it takes a few years for the country to recover. Investors who were burned on their investments from the last cycle are reluctant to return,  so it can take some time before capital inflows become strongly positive. But the price of domestic goods and domestic labor fell with the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  so the country is an attractive destination for foreign [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] and the capital starts to come back. Together,  higher exports and foreign direct [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] kickstart growth. If [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]] protect and recapitalize critical [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial institutions]],  the domestic financial pipelines are in place to support a recovery. The country is back to the early part of the cycle and starts a new virtuous cycle where productive [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] opportunities attract capital,  and capital drives up growth and asset prices,  which attracts more capital.

- Incomes and spending pick up \(usually after about one to two years\).
- It then takes several years \(usually about three\) from the bottom before the level of activity is back to average.
- The real FX is undervalued \(typically by around 10 percent on a PPP basis\) at the start of stabilization and stays cheap.
- Exports pick up a bit \(by 1 to 2 percent of GDP\).
- Capital inflows start to return a few years later \(on average four to five\). Equities take about the same amount of time to recover in foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] terms.

## ****The Spiral from a More Transitory Inflationary Depression to Hyperinflation

While in many cases [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]] are able to engineer a recovery in which incomes and spending pick up and [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] rates return to more typical levels \(transitory [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] crises\),  a subset of inflationary depressions do spiral into hyperinflations. Hyperinflations consist of extreme levels of [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] \(goods and services prices more than doubling every year or worse\) coupled with extreme losses of wealth and severe economic hardship. Because these cases are more common than one might think,  it is worth walking through how inflationary depressions spiral into hyperinflations.

**The most important characteristic of cases that spiral into hyperinflations is that [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]] don’t close the imbalance between external income,  external spending,  and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]],  and keep funding external spending over sustained periods of time by printing lots of money.** In some cases,  it’s not voluntary. [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|Weimar Germany]] had a crushing external [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] burden \(war reparations\) that for the most part couldn’t be defaulted on. The amount of capital that needed to flow out of the country was so great that it was all but destined that Weimar would face big [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] problems \(see our case study for more color\). In other cases,  [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|policy makers]] choose to keep [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|printing money]] to cover external spending—in effect,  aiming to prop up growth rather than bringing spending in line with income. If this is done repeatedly over years and on a large scale,  a country might face a hyperinflation that could have otherwise been avoided.

As stated earlier,  contrary to popular belief,  it’s not so easy to stop [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|printing money]] during a crisis. Stopping printing when capital is flowing out can cause an extreme tightness of [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] and often a deep economic contraction. And the longer the crisis goes on,  the harder it becomes to stop [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|printing money]]. For instance,  in [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|Weimar Germany]] there was literally a shortage of cash because the hyperinflation meant that the existing stock of money could buy less and less. \(By late October 1923,  toward the end of the crisis,  Germany’s entire 1913 stock of money would have just about gotten you a one-kilo loaf of rye bread.\) To stop printing would have meant there was so little cash that commerce would have virtually ground to a halt \(at least until they came up with an alternate [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]\). In an [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] spiral,  [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|printing money]] can seem like the prudent choice at the time—but continuing to print money time and time again feeds the [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] spiral until there is no way out.

### How the Spiral Plays Out

Over time,  as the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines and printing is used more and more,  people begin to shift their behavior and an inflationary psychology sets in. [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] declines inspire additional capital flight,  which causes an escalating feedback loop of depreciation,  [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]],  and money printing. Eventually,  the linkages that drove growth in earlier rounds decline and money printing become less effective.

**With each round of printing,  more of the printed money is transferred to real or foreign assets instead of being spent on goods and services that fuel economic activity.** Since investors that shorted cash and bought real/foreign assets were repeatedly better off than those who saved and invested domestically,  domestic [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] holders shift from investing the printed money in productive assets to real assets \(like gold\) and foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  in order to hedge [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] and a deterioration in their real wealth. Foreign investors stay away. Because the economy is weak and investors are buying real assets,  stocks suffer and no longer provide the wealth effect that drove earlier rounds of spending. The result is a [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] devaluation that doesn’t stimulate growth. This dynamic is important to inflationary deleveragings,  so we’ll walk through it in detail.

When continual [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines lead to persistent [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]],  it can become self-reinforcing in a way that nurtures [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] psychology and changes [[Runs On Money Market Mutual Funds|investor behavior]]. A key way this occurs is when [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] pressures spread to wages and produce a **wage-cost spiral**. Workers demand higher wages to compensate for their reduced purchasing power. Compelled to raise wages,  producers increase their prices to compensate. Sometimes this happens mechanically because of wage indexing—contracts in which employers agree to increase wages with [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]]. As is normal in such cases of price and wage indexing,  a vicious cycle is established: the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] depreciates,  internal prices rise,  the increase of the quantity of paper money once more lowers the value of the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  prices rise once more,  and so on.

With each successive [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] decline,  savers and investors also change their behavior. Savers,  who were burned before,  now move to protect their purchasing power. They are quicker to short cash and buy foreign and physical assets.

As [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] worsens,  bank depositors understandably want to be able to get their funds on short notice,  so they shorten their lending to banks. Deposits move to short-term checking accounts rather than longer-term savings. Investors shorten the [[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|duration]] of their lending,  or stop lending entirely,  because they are worried about risks of default or getting paid back in worthless money. During inflationary deleveragings,  average debt maturities always fall.

It’s also cheap to short cash,  as higher [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] and money printing lower [[Real Interest Rates and Aggregate Production|real interest rates]],  so the withdrawal of capital and faster borrowing cause illiquidity in the [[Contemporary Financial Intermediation Notes|financial system]]. Banks find it practically impossible to meet the demand for cash. No longer able to fulfill their contracts because of cash shortages,  businesses also suffer. At this point the choice for central banks,  who remember the benefits of the previous round of [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines,  is between extreme illiquidity and [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|printing money]] at an accelerating rate,  and the path is again obvious—i.e.,  to print. They provide [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] by [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|printing money]] to support the banks,  and often lending directly to businesses. When [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] are insufficient to compensate for future [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines,  this provision of [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] provides the funds that enable investors to continue to borrow and invest abroad and in [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] hedges \(like real assets or gold\),  which further contributes to the [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] and depreciation spiral.

Because much of the country’s debt is denominated in a foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  debt burdens rise when the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] falls,  which requires spending cuts and asset sales. While this effect was originally overcome by the stimulation of the falling [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  it becomes increasingly devastating as that effect fades and the debt burden grows. These higher debt burdens also mean foreign investors want higher [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] as compensation for the risk of default. This means that [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines and [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] often increase [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] and debt burdens,  making it even harder to stimulate through the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].

Many governments respond to rising debt burdens by raising taxes on income and wealth. With their net worths already eroding because of the bad economy and their failing investments,  the wealthy desperately try to preserve their rapidly shrinking wealth at all costs. This leads to extremely high rates of tax evasion and increases the flight of capital abroad. This is typical in deleveragings.

As growth weakens further,  the lack of foreign lending shuts down an important source of credit creation. And while there is a lot of domestic credit creation and borrowing,  this borrowing does not result in much growth because so much of it is spent abroad on foreign assets. Of the spending that does occur locally,  much of it doesn’t contribute to GDP. For example,  investors buy lots of gold,  factories,  or imports \(even rocks in the case of the [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Weimar Republic]]\!\) as [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|store holds of wealth]]. Capital investments like machinery and tools are purchased as stores of value,  not because they were needed.

It’s easy to see how these forces can create a feedback mechanism that causes [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines to escalate until people completely lose faith in the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]. Money loses its role as a store of value \(and people hold at most a few days’ reserves\). The long list of zeros also makes it an impossible unit of account. Money also breaks down as a medium of exchange,  because the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] instability makes producers unwilling to sell their products for domestic [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  and producers often demand payment in foreign currencies or barter. Because there is a shortage of foreign exchange,  illiquidity reaches its peak and demand collapses. This form of illiquidity can’t be relieved by money printing. Stores close and unemployment rises. As the economy enters hyperinflation,  it contracts rapidly because the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines that were once beneficial now just create chaos.

In addition to causing an economic contraction,  hyperinflation wipes out financial wealth as financial assets fail to keep pace with [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]] and [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]]. Hyperinflation also causes extreme wealth redistributions. Lenders see their wealth get inflated away,  as do debtor’s liabilities. Economic contraction,  extreme wealth redistributions,  and chaos create political tensions and clashes. Frequently public servants like police officers go on strike because they don’t want to work for worthless paper money. Disorder,  crime,  looting,  and violence typically reach their peak during this phase. In [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|Weimar Germany]],  the government had to respond to the disorder by issuing a “state of siege,  ” granting military authorities greater power over domestic policies such as carrying out arrests and breaking up demonstrations.

Investing during a hyperinflation has a few basic principles: get short the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  do whatever you can to get your money out of the country,  buy [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|commodities]],  and invest in commodity industries \(like gold,  coal,  and metals\). Buying equities is a mixed bag: investing in the [[Hedge Fund Strategies|stock market]] becomes a losing proposition as [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] transitions to hyperinflation. Instead of there being a high correlation between the exchange rate and the price of shares,  there is an increasing divergence between share prices and the exchange rate. So,  during this time gold becomes the preferred asset to hold,  shares are a disaster even though they rise in local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  and bonds are wiped out.

Once an inflationary deleveraging spirals into hyperinflation,  the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] never recovers its status as a store hold of wealth. Creating a new [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] with very hard backing while phasing out the old [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] is the classic path that countries follow in order to end inflationary deleveragings.
