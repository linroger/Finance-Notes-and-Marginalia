# Understanding Debt Crises and Their Management

**How Costly Is Bad Debt Relative to Not Having the Spending That the Debt Is Financing?**

Suppose that,  as a policy maker,  you decide to build a [subway system](.md) that costs $1 billion. You finance it with debt that you expect to be paid back from revenue,  but the economics turn out to be so much worse than you expected that only half of the expected revenues come in. The debt has to be written down by 50 percent. Does that mean you shouldn’t have built the subway?

Rephrased,  the question is whether the [subway system](.md) is worth $500 million more than what was initially budgeted,  or,  on an annual basis,  whether it is worth about 2 percent more per year than budgeted,  supposing the [subway system](.md) has a 25-year lifespan. Looked at this way,  you may well assess that having the [subway system](.md) at that cost is a lot better than not having the [subway system](.md).

To give you an idea of what that might mean for an economy as a whole,  really [bad debt losses](.md) have been when roughly 40 percent of a loan’s value couldn’t be paid back. Those bad loans amount to about 20 percent of all the outstanding loans,  so the losses are equal to about 8 percent of total debt. That total debt,  in turn,  is equal to about 200 percent of income (e.g.,  GDP),  so the shortfall is roughly equal to 16 percent of GDP. If that cost is “socialized” (i.e.,  borne by the society as a whole via fiscal and/or monetary policies) and spread over 15 years,  it would amount to about 1 percent per year,  which is tolerable. Of course,  if not spread out,  the costs would be intolerable.

For that reason,  **the downside risks of having a significant amount of debt depends a lot on the willingness and the ability of [policy makers](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) to spread out the losses arising from bad debts.** I have seen this in all the cases I have lived through and studied. Whether [policy makers](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) can do this depends on two factors:

1. **Whether the debt is denominated in the [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) that they control.**
1. **Whether they have influence over how creditors and debtors behave with each other.**

**Are Debt Crises Inevitable?**

Throughout history,  only a few well-disciplined countries have avoided debt crises. That’s because lending is never done perfectly and is often done badly due to how the cycle affects people’s psychology to produce bubbles and busts. While [policy makers](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) generally try to get it right,  more often than not they err on the side of being too loose with credit because the near-term rewards (faster growth) seem to justify it. It is also politically easier to allow easy credit (e.g.,  by providing guarantees,  easing monetary policies) than to have tight credit. That is the main reason we see big debt cycles.

**Why Do Debt Crises Come in Cycles?**

Whenever I start talking about cycles,  particularly big,  long-term cycles,  people’s eyebrows go up; the reactions I elicit are similar to those I’d expect if I were talking about astrology. For that reason,  I want to emphasize that I am talking about **nothing more than logically-driven series of events that recur in patterns.** In a market-based economy,  expansions and contractions in credit drive economic cycles,  which occur for perfectly logical reasons. Though the patterns are similar,  the sequences are neither pre-destined to repeat in exactly the same ways nor to take exactly the same amount of time.

**The Mechanics of [Borrowing and Spending](.md)**

To put these complicated matters into very simple terms,  you create a cycle virtually anytime you borrow money. Buying something you can’t afford means spending more than you make. You’re not just borrowing from your lender; you are borrowing from your future self. Essentially,  you are creating a time in the future in which you will need to spend less than you make so you can pay it back.

- **The Cycle Pattern:**
- The pattern of borrowing,  spending more than you make,  and then having to spend less than you make very quickly resembles a cycle.
- This is as true for a national economy as it is for an individual.
- Borrowing money sets a mechanical,  predictable series of events into motion.

**The Monopoly® Analogy**

If you understand the game of Monopoly®,  you can pretty well understand how credit cycles work on the level of a whole economy.

- **Early Game Dynamics:**
- Players have a lot of cash and only a few properties,  so it pays to convert your cash into property.
- **Progression of the Game:**
- As the game progresses and players acquire more and more houses and hotels,  more and more cash is needed to pay the rents that are charged when you land on a property that has a lot of them.
- Some players are forced to sell their property at discounted prices to raise that cash.
- **Shifting Priorities:**
- Early in the game,  “property is king” and later in the game,  “cash is king.”
- Those who play the game best understand how to hold the right mix of property and cash as the game progresses.

Now,  let’s imagine how this Monopoly® game would work if we allowed the bank to make loans and take deposits.

- **Introducing [Banking](../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) Mechanics:**
- Players would be able to borrow money to buy property.
- Rather than holding their cash idly,  they would deposit it at the bank to earn interest,  which in turn would provide the bank with more money to lend.
- Players could buy and sell properties from each other on credit (i.e.,  by promising to pay back the money with interest at a later date).

If Monopoly® were played this way,  it would provide an almost perfect model for the way our economy operates.

- **Expansion of Credit:**
- The amount of debt-financed spending on hotels would quickly grow to multiples of the amount of money in existence.
- **Emergence of Problems:**
- Down the road,  the debtors who hold those hotels will become short on the cash they need to pay their rents and service their debt.
- The bank will also get into trouble as their depositors’ rising need for cash will cause them to withdraw it,  even as more and more debtors are falling behind on their payments.
- **Potential Collapse:**
- If nothing is done to intervene,  both banks and debtors will go broke and the economy will contract.
- Over time,  as these cycles of expansion and contraction occur repeatedly,  the conditions are created for a big,  long-term [debt crisis](../Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%20(2007–2011).md).

**Self-Reinforcing Movements in Lending**

Lending naturally creates self-reinforcing upward movements that eventually reverse to create self-reinforcing downward movements that must reverse in turn.

**During the Upswings**

- **Support for Spending and [Investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md):**
- Lending supports spending and [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md),  which in turn supports incomes and asset prices.
- **Cycle of Borrowing:**
- Increased incomes and asset prices support further [borrowing and spending](.md) on goods and financial assets.
- The borrowing essentially lifts spending and incomes above the consistent productivity growth of the economy.
- **Unsustainable [Expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md):**
- Near the peak of the upward cycle,  lending is based on the expectation that the above-trend growth will continue indefinitely.
- But,  of course,  that can’t happen; eventually income will fall below the cost of the loans.

**Susceptibility of Certain Economies**

- **Economies with Debt-Financed Growth:**
- Economies whose growth is significantly supported by debt-financed building of fixed investments,  real estate,  and infrastructure are particularly susceptible to large [Forecasting](Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20[[Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting))|cyclical]] swings because the fast rates of building those long-lived assets are not sustainable.
- **Decline in Incremental Need:**
- If you need better housing and you build it,  the incremental need to build more housing naturally declines.
- **Impact on Growth:**
- As spending on housing slows down,  so does housing’s impact on growth.
- For example,  if you have been spending $10 million a year to build an office building (hiring workers,            buying steel and concrete,            etc.),            when the building is finished,            the spending will fall to $0 per year,  as will the demand for workers and construction materials.
- **Dependence on Other Demand:**
- From that point forward,  growth,  income,  and the ability to service debt will depend on other demand.
- **Typical Cycle in Emerging Economies:**
- This type of cycle—where a strong growth upswing driven by debt-financed real estate,  fixed [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md),  and infrastructure spending is followed by a downswing driven by a debt-challenged slowdown in demand—is very typical of emerging economies because they have so much building to do.

**Changes in Competitiveness**

- **Impact of Rising Incomes:**
- Contributing further to the [Forecasting](Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20[[Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting))|cyclicality]] of emerging countries’ economies are changes in their competitiveness due to relative changes in their incomes.
- **Initial Advantages:**
- Typically,  they have very cheap labor and bad infrastructure,  so they build infrastructure,  have an export boom,  and experience rising incomes.
- **Natural Slowdown:**
- But the rate of growth due to exports naturally slows as their income levels rise and their wage competitiveness relative to other countries declines.
- **Historical Examples:**
- There are many examples of these kinds of cycles (e.g.,  Japan’s experience over the last 70 years).

**The Role of Bubbles in Debt Cycles**

In “bubbles,  ” the unrealistic [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) and reckless lending result in a critical mass of bad loans.

- **Warning Signs:**
- One classic warning sign that a bubble is coming is when an increasing amount of money is being borrowed to make [debt service](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) payments,  which of course compounds the borrowers’ indebtedness.
- **Deflation of the Bubble:**
- When money and credit growth are curtailed and/or higher lending standards are imposed,  the rates of credit growth and spending slow and more [debt service](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) problems emerge.
- At this point,  the top of the upward phase of the [debt cycle](../Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%201928-1937.md) is at hand.
- **Tightening [Monetary Policy](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md):**
- Realizing that credit growth is dangerously fast,  the central banks tighten [Risk and Return](Lecture%207-[[Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds) of Bonds#7.6 [Asset price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) reactions to [monetary policy](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) surprises|[monetary policy](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md)]] to contain it,  which often accelerates the decline (though it would have happened anyway,  just a bit later).
- **Reversal of the Upward Cycle:**
- When the costs of [debt service](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) become greater than the amount that can be borrowed to finance spending,  the upward cycle reverses.
- Not only does new lending slow down,  but the pressure on debtors to make their payments is increased.
- The clearer it becomes that debtors are struggling,  the less new lending there is.
- **Economic Slowdown:**
- The slowdown in spending and [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) that results slows down income growth even further,  and asset prices decline.

**Impact on Lending Institutions**

When borrowers cannot meet their [debt service](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) obligations to lending institutions,  those lending institutions cannot meet their obligations to their own creditors.

- **[Policy Makers](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md)’ Role:**
- [Policy makers](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) must handle this by dealing with the lending institutions first.
- **Risks from Highly Leveraged Lenders:**
- The most extreme pressures are typically experienced by the lenders that are the most highly leveraged and that have the most concentrated exposures to failed borrowers.
- These lenders pose the biggest risks of creating knock-on effects for creditworthy buyers and across the economy.
- **Variety of Lenders:**
- Typically,  they are banks,  but as credit systems have grown more dynamic,  a broader set of lenders has emerged,  such as insurance companies,  non-bank trusts,  broker-dealers,  and even special purpose vehicles.

**The Two Main Long-Term Problems**

1. **Losses from Unmet [Debt Service](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) Payments:**

- When promised [debt service](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) payments can’t be made,  that can lead to either smaller periodic payments and/or the writing down of the value of the debt (i.e.,  agreeing to accept less than was owed).
- If you were expecting an annual [debt service](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) payment of 4 percent and it comes in at 2 percent or 0 percent,  there is that shortfall for each year,  whereas if the debt is marked down,  that year’s loss would be much bigger (e.g.,  50 percent).

1. **Reduction of Future Lending and Spending:**

- Even after a [debt crisis](../Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%20(2007–2011).md) is resolved,  it is unlikely that the entities that borrowed too much can generate the same level of spending in the future that they had before the crisis.
- That has implications that must be considered.

**Can Most Debt Crises Be Managed So There Aren’t Big Problems?**

Sometimes these cycles are moderate,  like bumps in the road,  and sometimes they are extreme,  ending in crashes. In this study,  we examine ones that are extreme—i.e.,  all those in the last 100 years that produced declines in real GDP of more than 3 percent.

Based on my examinations of them and the ways the levers available to [policy makers](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) work,  I believe that it is possible for [policy makers](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) to manage them well in almost every case that the debts are denominated in a country’s own [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). That is because the flexibility that [policy makers](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) have allows them to spread out the harmful consequences in such ways that big debt problems aren’t really big problems.

Most of the really terrible economic problems that debt crises have caused occurred before [policy makers](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) took steps to spread them out. Even the biggest debt crises in history (e.g.,  the 1930s [Great Depression](../Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%201928-1937.md)) were gotten past once the right adjustments were made.

From my examination of these cases,  the biggest risks are not from the debts themselves but from:

- **a) The failure of [policy makers](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) to do the right things,  due to a lack of knowledge and/or lack of authority.**
- **b) The political consequences of making adjustments that hurt some people in the process of helping others.**

It is from a desire to help reduce these risks that I have written this study.

**Important Considerations**

Having said that,  I want to reiterate that:

1. **When debts are denominated in foreign currencies rather than one’s own [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  it is much harder for a country’s [policy makers](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) to do the sorts of things that spread out the debt problems.**
1. **The fact that debt crises can be well-managed does not mean that they are not extremely costly to some people.**

**The key to handling debt crises well lies in [policy makers](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md)’ knowing how to use their levers well and having the authority that they need to do so,  knowing at what rate per year the burdens will have to be spread out,  and who will benefit and who will suffer and in what degree,  so that the political and other consequences are acceptable.**

**The Four Types of Policy Levers**

There are four types of levers that [policy makers](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) can pull to bring debt and [debt service](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) levels down relative to the income and [cash flow](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) levels that are required to service them:

1. **Austerity (i.e.,  spending less).**
1. **Debt defaults/restructurings.**
1. **The central bank “[printing money](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md)” and making purchases (or providing guarantees).**
1. **Transfers of money and credit from those who have more than they need to those who have less.**

**Impacts on the Economy**

- **Inflationary and Stimulative Levers:**
- Some are inflationary and stimulate growth (e.g.,  “[printing money](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md)”).
- **Deflationary Levers:**
- Others are deflationary and help reduce debt burdens (e.g.,  austerity and defaults).

**The key to creating a “beautiful deleveraging” (a reduction in debt/income ratios accompanied by acceptable [inflation](Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and growth rates) lies in striking the right balance between them.** In this happy scenario,  debt-to-income ratios decline at the same time that economic activity and financial asset prices improve,  gradually bringing the nominal growth rate of incomes back above the nominal interest rate.

**Political Challenges**

These levers shift around who benefits and who suffers,  and over what amount of time. [Policy makers](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) are put in the politically difficult position of having to make those choices. As a result,  they are rarely appreciated,  even when they handle the [debt crisis](../Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%20(2007–2011).md) well.

**The Template for the Archetypal Long-Term/[Big Debt Cycle](../How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke%20Introduction%20&%20Chapter%201.md)**

The template that follows is based on my examination of 48 big debt cycles,  which include all of the cases that led to real GDP falling by more than 3 percent in large countries (which is what I will call a depression).

**Classification of Debt Crises**

For clarity,  I divided the affected countries into two groups:

1. **Countries without significant foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt and without inflationary depressions.**
1. **Countries with significant foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt and with inflationary depressions.**

Since there was about a 75 percent correlation between the amounts of their foreign debts and the amounts of [inflation](Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) that they experienced (which is not surprising,  since having a lot of their debts denominated in foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) was a cause of their depressions being inflationary),  it made sense to group those that had more foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt with those that had inflationary depressions.

**Understanding Debt Crises**

Typically,  debt crises occur because debt and [debt service](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) costs rise faster than the incomes that are needed to service them,  causing a deleveraging.

- **Limitations of Central Banks:**
- While the central bank can alleviate typical debt crises by lowering real and [nominal interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md),  severe debt crises (i.e.,  depressions) occur when this is no longer possible.
- **Accumulation of Short-Term Cycles:**
- Classically,  a lot of [short-term debt](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/When%20Safe%20Proved%20Risky%20Commercial%20Paper%20During%20the%20Financial%20Crisis%20of%202007%202009.md) cycles (i.e.,  business cycles) add up to a long-term [debt cycle](../Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%201928-1937.md),  because each short-term [Forecasting](Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20[[Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting))|cyclical]] high and each short-term [Forecasting](Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20[[Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting))|cyclical]] low is higher in its debt-to-income ratio than the one before it,  until the interest rate reductions that helped fuel the expansion in debt can no longer continue.
- **Visual Representation:**
- The chart below shows the debt and [debt service](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) burden (both principal and interest) in the US since 1910.
- You will note how the interest payments remain flat or go down even when the debt goes up,  so that the rise in [debt service](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) costs is not as great as the rise in debt.
- That is because the central bank (in this case,  the Federal Reserve) lowers [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) to keep the debt-financed expansion going until they can’t do it any more (because the interest rate hits 0 percent).
- When that happens,  the deleveraging begins.

**Limitations of Data Representation**

While the chart gives a good general picture,  I should make clear that it is inadequate in two respects:

1. **Lack of Detail on Entities:**

- It doesn’t convey the differences between the various entities that make up these total numbers,  which are very important to understand.

1. **Exclusion of Other Liabilities:**

- It just shows what is called debt,  so it doesn’t reflect liabilities such as pension and health care obligations,  which are much larger.

Having this more granular perspective is very important in gauging a country’s vulnerabilities,  though for the most part such issues are beyond the scope of this book.

**Our Examination of the Cycle**

In developing the template,  we will focus on the period leading up to the depression,  the depression period itself,  and the deleveraging period that follows the bottom of the depression.

**Types of [Big Debt Crises](Principles%20Part%20II.md)**

As there are two broad types of [big debt crises](Principles%20Part%20II.md)—deflationary ones and inflationary ones (largely depending on whether a country has a lot of foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt or not)—we will examine them separately.

**Statistical Basis**

The statistics reflected in the charts of the phases were derived by averaging 21 [deflationary debt cycle](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/The%20Mechanics%20of%20the%20Deflationary%20Debt%20Cycle.md) cases and 27 [inflationary debt cycle](../Chapters/Part%201%20The%20Archetypal%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle.md) cases,  starting five years before the bottom of the depression and continuing for seven years after it.

**Comparison with [Short-Term Debt](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/When%20Safe%20Proved%20Risky%20Commercial%20Paper%20During%20the%20Financial%20Crisis%20of%202007%202009.md) Cycles**

Notably,  long-term debt cycles appear similar in many ways to [short-term debt](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/When%20Safe%20Proved%20Risky%20Commercial%20Paper%20During%20the%20Financial%20Crisis%20of%202007%202009.md) cycles,  except that they are more extreme,  both because the debt burdens are higher and the monetary policies that can address them are less effective.

- **Short-Term Cycles:**
- For the most part,  [short-term debt](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/When%20Safe%20Proved%20Risky%20Commercial%20Paper%20During%20the%20Financial%20Crisis%20of%202007%202009.md) cycles produce bumps—mini-booms and recessions.
- **Long-Term Cycles:**
- Big long-term ones produce big booms and busts.
- Over the last century,  the US has gone through a long-term [debt crisis](../Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%20(2007–2011).md) twice—once during the boom of the 1920s and the [Great Depression](../Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%201928-1937.md) of the 1930s,  and again during the boom of the early 2000s and the [financial crisis](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) starting in 2008.

**Dynamics of the [Short-Term Debt](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/When%20Safe%20Proved%20Risky%20Commercial%20Paper%20During%20the%20Financial%20Crisis%20of%202007%202009.md) Cycle**

In the [short-term debt](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/When%20Safe%20Proved%20Risky%20Commercial%20Paper%20During%20the%20Financial%20Crisis%20of%202007%202009.md) cycle,  spending is constrained only by the willingness of lenders and borrowers to provide and receive credit.

- **Economic Expansion:**
- When credit is easily available,  there’s an economic expansion.
- **Recession:**
- When credit isn’t easily available,  there’s a recession.
- **Role of Central Banks:**
- The availability of credit is controlled primarily by the central bank.
- The central bank is generally able to bring the economy out of a recession by easing rates to stimulate the cycle anew.
- **Cumulative Debt Growth:**
- Over time,  each bottom and top of the cycle finishes with more economic activity than the previous cycle,  and with more debt.
- People have an inclination to borrow and spend more instead of paying back debt.
- It’s human nature; as a result,  over long periods of time,  debts rise faster than incomes.
- This creates the long-term [debt cycle](../Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%201928-1937.md).

**Dynamics of the Long-Term [Debt Cycle](../Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%201928-1937.md)**

During the upswing of the long-term [debt cycle](../Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%201928-1937.md),  lenders extend credit freely even as people become more indebted.

- **Self-Reinforcing Upside:**
- The process is self-reinforcing on the upside—rising spending generates rising incomes and rising net worths,  which raises borrowers’ capacities to borrow,  which allows more buying and spending,  etc.
- **Risk Appetite:**
- Most everyone is willing to take on more risk.
- New types of [financial intermediaries](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Financial%20Intermediation%20as%20Delegated%20Monitoring.md) and new types of [financial instruments](../../../Financial%20Instruments/A%20Practical%20Guide%20for%20Actuaries%20and%20other%20Business%20Professionals..md) develop that are outside the supervision and protection of regulatory authorities.
- That puts them in a competitively attractive position to offer higher [returns](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md),  take on more [leverage](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md),  and make loans that have greater [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) or [credit risk](../../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md).
- **Appearance of Prosperity:**
- With credit plentiful,  borrowers typically spend more than is sustainable,  giving them the appearance of being prosperous.
- In turn,  lenders,  who are enjoying the good times,  are more complacent than they should be.
- **Approaching the Limits:**
- Debts can’t continue to rise faster than the money and income that is necessary to service them forever,  so they are headed toward a debt problem.

**The Downward Spiral**

When the limits of debt growth relative to income growth are reached,  the process works in reverse.

- **[Asset Price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) Declines:**
- Asset prices fall,  debtors have problems servicing their debts,  and investors get scared and cautious,  which leads them to sell,  or not roll over,  their loans.
- **[Liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) Problems:**
- This,  in turn,  leads to [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) problems,  which means that people cut back on their spending.
- **Declining Incomes:**
- Since one person’s spending is another person’s income,  incomes begin to go down,  which makes people even less creditworthy.
- **Further [Asset Price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) Falls:**
- Asset prices fall,  further squeezing banks,  while debt repayments continue to rise,  making spending drop even further.
- **Economic Contraction:**
- The [stock market](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) crashes and social tensions rise along with unemployment,  as credit and cash-starved companies reduce their expenses.
- **Vicious Cycle:**
- The whole thing starts to feed on itself the other way,  becoming a vicious,  self-reinforcing contraction that’s not easily corrected.
- **Need for Debt Reduction:**
- Debt burdens have simply become too big and need to be reduced.

**Limitations of [Monetary Policy](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md)**

Unlike in recessions,  when monetary policies can be eased by lowering [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and increasing [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md),  which in turn increase the capacities and incentives to lend,  [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) can’t be lowered in depressions.

- **Zero Interest Rate Bound:**
- They are already at or near zero,  and [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md)/money can’t be increased by ordinary measures.

**Historical Perspective on Debt Cycles**

This is the dynamic that creates long-term debt cycles. It has existed for as long as there has been credit,  going back to before Roman times.

**Ancient Recognition**

- **Year of Jubilee:**
- Even the Old Testament described the need to wipe out debt once every 50 years,  which was called the Year of Jubilee.
- **Recurring Patterns:**
- Like most dramas,  this one both arises and transpires in ways that have reoccurred throughout history.

**Dual Purpose of Money**

Remember that money serves two purposes: it is a medium of exchange and a store hold of wealth.

- **Serving Two Masters:**
- Because it has two purposes,  it serves two masters:

1. **Those who want to obtain it for “life’s necessities,  ” usually by working for it.**
1. **Those who have stored wealth tied to its value.**

- **Historical Classifications:**
- Throughout history,  these two groups have been called different things—e.g.,  the first group has been called workers,  the proletariat,  and “the have-nots,  ” and the second group has been called capitalists,  investors,  and “the haves.”
- For simplicity,  we will call the first group proletariat-workers and the second group capitalists-investors.

**Interactions Between Groups**

- **Earning Methods:**
- Proletariat-workers earn their money by selling their time.
- Capitalists-investors earn their money by “lending” others the use of their money in exchange for either:
- a) A promise to repay an amount of money that is greater than the loan (which is a debt instrument).
- b) A piece of ownership in the business (which we call “equity” or “stocks”) or a piece of another asset (e.g.,  real estate).
- **Major Players:**
- These two groups,  along with the government (which sets the rules),  are the major players in this drama.

**The Need for Deleveraging**

One person’s financial assets are another’s financial liabilities (i.e.,  promises to deliver money).

- **Imbalance of Claims and Money:**
- When the claims on financial assets are too high relative to the money available to meet them,  a big deleveraging must occur.
- **Breakdown of Free-Market Credit System:**
- Then the free-market credit system that finances spending ceases to work well,  and typically works in reverse via a deleveraging.
- **Government Intervention:**
- Necessitating the government to intervene in a big way as the central bank becomes a big buyer of debt (i.e.,  [lender of last resort](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/The%20Only%20Game%20in%20Town%20Walter%20Bagehot.md)) and the central government becomes a redistributor of spending and wealth.

- At such times,  there needs to be a [Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy](Class%20Slide%204-[[Class%20Slide%204-Restructuring%20Debt%20Outside%20Bankruptcy)|[Debt Restructuring](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Class%20Slide%204-Restructuring%20Debt%20Outside%20Bankruptcy.md) ]] in which claims on future spending (i.e.,  debt) are reduced relative to what they are claims on (i.e.,  money).

**Historical Resolutions**

- **Recurring Imbalances:**
- This fundamental imbalance between the size of the claims on money (debt) and the supply of money (i.e.,  the [cash flow](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) that is needed to service the debt) has occurred many times in history.
- **Resolution Methods:**
- It has always been resolved via some combination of the four levers previously described.
- **Social Impact:**
- The process is painful for all of the players,  sometimes so much so that it causes a battle between the proletariat-workers and the capitalists-investors.
- **Extreme Measures:**
- It can get so bad that lending is impaired or even outlawed.
- **Historical Prohibitions:**
- Historians say that the problems that arose from credit creation were why usury (lending money for interest) was considered a sin in both Catholicism and Islam.

**Types of Depressions: Deflationary vs. Inflationary**

In this study,  we will examine big debt cycles that produce [big debt crises](Principles%20Part%20II.md),  exploring how they work and how to deal with them well. But before we begin,  I want to clarify the differences between the two main types: deflationary and inflationary depressions.

**Deflationary Depressions**

- **Policy Response Limitations:**
- In deflationary depressions,  [policy makers](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) respond to the initial economic contraction by lowering [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).
- But when [interest rates](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) reach about 0 percent,  that lever is no longer an effective way to stimulate the economy.
- **Dominance of Austerity:**
- [Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy](Class%20Slide%204-[[Class%20Slide%204-Restructuring%20Debt%20Outside%20Bankruptcy)|[Debt Restructuring](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Class%20Slide%204-Restructuring%20Debt%20Outside%20Bankruptcy.md) ]] and austerity dominate,  without being balanced by adequate stimulation (especially money printing and [currency depreciation](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises%201.md)).
- **Rising Debt Burdens:**
- In this phase,  debt burdens (debt and [debt service](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) as a percent of income) rise because incomes fall faster than restructuring.
- Debt paydowns reduce the debt stock,  and many borrowers are required to rack up still more debts to cover those higher interest costs.
- **Characteristics:**
- Deflationary depressions typically occur in countries where most of the unsustainable debt was financed domestically in local [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).
- The eventual debt bust produces forced selling and defaults,  but not a [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) or a [balance of payments](../../The%20Balance%20of%20Payments.md) problem.

**Inflationary Depressions**

- **Reliance on Foreign Capital:**
- Inflationary depressions classically occur in countries that are reliant on foreign [capital flows](../../Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md).
- They have built up a significant amount of debt denominated in foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) that can’t be monetized (i.e.,  bought by money printed by the central bank).
- **Capital Withdrawal Effects:**
- When those foreign [capital flows](../../Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) slow,  credit creation turns into credit contraction.
- **[Currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) Declines and [Inflation](Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md):**
- In an inflationary deleveraging,  capital withdrawal dries up lending and [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) at the same time that [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) declines produce [inflation](Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md).
- **Management Challenges:**
- Inflationary depressions in which a lot of debt is denominated in foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) are especially difficult to manage because [policy makers](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md)’ abilities to spread out the pain are more limited.

By understanding these dynamics,  we can better comprehend how debt crises develop and what tools are available to [policy makers](Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) to manage them effectively.
