# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1

## Introduction
- **Previous Section Recap**
  - Discussed the archetypal [deflationary debt crisis](Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md).
  - Created by averaging 21 deflationary cycles.
- **Current Focus**
  - Examining the archetypal [inflationary debt crisis](Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md).
  - Created by averaging 27 worst cases of inflationary cycles.
- **Further Reading**
  - Hyperinflation in Germany’s [Weimar Republic](Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) (Part 2).

## Fundamental Concepts
- **[Currency and Debt Functions](.md)**
  - Serve as [mediums of exchange](Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md).
  - Act as stores of wealth.
- **Debt Dynamics**
  - Debt is an asset for one party and a liability for another.
  - Represents a promise to pay in a specific [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).
- **[Inflation](../../Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and [Interest Rates](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md)**
  - Holders of debt assets are concerned with [inflation](../../Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) vs. interest rate compensation.
  - Central banks produce money and credit in their respective currencies.
- **Debt Accumulation**
  - Central banks and market participants create increasing piles of debt.
  - Balancing these piles is crucial to avoid deflationary or inflationary depressions.
- **[Policy Makers](Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md)' Role**
  - Control monetary and fiscal policies to balance opposing forces in debt crises.
  - Central banks often print [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) to relieve debt crises,  affecting [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) value.

## Currency Dynamics and Inflationary Depressions
- **[Currency Weakness](Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md)**
  - If a [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) depreciates faster than its interest rate,  debt holders lose money.
  - Investors may sell weak [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) assets for stronger currencies or non-[currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) assets like gold.
- **Central Bank Challenges**
  - Raising [interest rates](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) to compensate for [currency weakness](Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) is often impossible during crises.
  - Money outflows can lead to credit market tightening or increased money printing.
- **Trade-offs in [Inflation](../../Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and Growth**
  - Central banks manage [inflation](../../Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and growth by adjusting [interest rates](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and [liquidity](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md).
  - Demand for [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)/debt affects [inflation](../../Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and growth dynamics.
- **Capital Outflows**
  - Occur in inhospitable environments (debt,  economic,  political issues).
  - Weaken the [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) further,  increasing debt costs for those borrowing in stronger currencies.

## Vulnerability to Inflationary Deleveragings
- **Factors Increasing Vulnerability**
  - Lack of [reserve currency status](../../../How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke-Chapter%2015%20&%20Chapter%2016.md).
  - Low foreign-exchange reserves.
  - Large foreign debt.
  - Large budget/[current account](../../../../Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) deficits.
  - Negative [real interest rates](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Aggregate%20Production.md).
  - History of high [inflation](../../Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and negative [returns](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md).
- **Iconic Case Study**
  - German [Weimar Republic](Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) in the early 1920s.
- **Reserve-[Currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) Countries**
  - Less likely to experience severe inflationary contractions.
  - Can still face inflationary depressions with excessive monetary stimulation.

## Phases of the Classic Inflationary Debt Cycle
- **[Overview](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Overview%20of%20Financial%20Markets.md)**
  - Inflationary deleveragings follow five stages,  similar to deflationary ones but differ in key aspects.

### 1) The Early Part of the Cycle
- **Healthy Upswing**
  - Favorable [capital flows](../../../../Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) due to [competitive](../../../../Globalization/Chapter%203-Comparative%20Advantage,%20Competitiveness,%20and%20the%20Terms%20of%20Trade.md) [fundamentals](../../../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md).
  - Low debt levels and healthy balance sheets stimulate growth.
- **Capital Flows**
  - Volatile but crucial for economic health.
  - Debt and incomes rise at comparable rates,  encouraging [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).
- **[Currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) Demand**
  - Strong [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) demand improves [balance of payments](../../../../The%20Balance%20of%20Payments.md).
  - Central banks may intervene to manage [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) appreciation.
- **Foreign-Exchange Reserves**
  - Accumulated to cushion [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) market movements.
  - Stimulate the economy by maintaining export competitiveness.

### 2) The Bubble
- **Emergence of the Bubble**
  - Self-reinforcing cycle of [capital flows](../../../../Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md),  [asset returns](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%201%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Overview/Some%20Stylized%20Empirical%20Facts%20About%20Asset%20Retur.md),  and [economic conditions](../../../Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%20(2007–2011).md).
  - Asset prices rise,  often financed by debt,  leading to overvaluation.
- **[Currency and Asset Dynamics](.md)**
  - Strong exchange rates and increasing reserves boost the economy.
  - Attractive [returns](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) encourage more inflows,  creating bubbles in debt and stock markets.

## Conclusion
- **Inflationary Depressions**
  - Result from complex interactions between [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) dynamics,  debt,  and economic policies.
  - Understanding these phases and vulnerabilities is crucial for managing economic stability.

  - Stimulate the economy by maintaining export competitiveness.

### 2) The Bubble
- **Emergence of the Bubble**
  - Self-reinforcing cycle of [capital flows](../../../../Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md),  [asset returns](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%201%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Overview/Some%20Stylized%20Empirical%20Facts%20About%20Asset%20Retur.md),  and [economic conditions](../../../Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%20(2007–2011).md).

- **[Investor Sentiment](Lecture%204-%20[[Lecture%204-%20Investor%20Sentiment)|[investor sentiment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%204-%20Investor%20Sentiment.md)]]**
  - Investors believe the country’s assets are a fabulous treasure to own.
  - New investors rush in,  fearing they are missing out.
- **Market Conditions**
  - Market becomes fully long,  leveraged,  and overpriced,  ripe for reversal.
  - Foreign [capital flows](../../../../Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) are high (around 10% of GDP on average).
  - Central bank accumulates foreign-exchange reserves.
  - Real FX becomes overvalued by around 15% on a PPP basis.
  - Stocks rally by over 20% for several years into their peak.
- **[Currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) Positions**

  - Participants are motivated to be long the [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) due to sustained [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) waves.
- **Foreign and Local Business Dynamics**
  - Foreign businesses may fund activities in their own [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) but hold deposits in local [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).
  - Local businesses might borrow in weaker foreign [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  encouraged by eager foreign bankers.
- **Economic Growth and [Investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)**
  - Influx of foreign capital finances a consumption boom.
  - Imports rise faster than exports,  worsening the [current account](../../../../Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md).
  - High export prices increase income and incentivize [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).
- **Debt and Economic Activity**
  - Debt burdens rise fast,  with debt to GDP increasing at about 10% annually over three years.
  - Foreign-[currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt rises to around 35% of total debt and 45% of GDP.
  - Economic activity is strong,  with GDP gap around +4%.
- **Bubble Dynamics**
  - Debt as a percentage of GDP rises from around 125% to about 150%.
  - Current account deteriorates by about 2% of GDP.
  - Economic activity remains strong due to continued capital inflows.

### 3) The Top and Currency Defense
- **Bubble Burst**
  - Occurs when flows that caused the bubble become unsustainable.
  - Sets in motion a cycle of weakening capital inflows and asset prices.
- **[Balance of Payments](../../../../The%20Balance%20of%20Payments.md) Crisis**
  - Triggered by minor events due to high optimism and [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).
  - Adverse shifts in [capital flows](../../../../Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) are more important than trade balances.
- **Crisis Triggers**
  - Income from exports drops due to high [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) or falling [commodity prices](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Primary%20vs.%20Secondary%20Commodities.md).
  - Costs of imports or borrowing rise.
  - Declines in [capital flows](../../../../Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) due to economic or political concerns.
- **Capital Outflows**
  - Domestic entities seek to move money out of the country.
  - Weakening [capital flows](../../../../Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) directly cause growth to weaken.
- **[Economic Impact](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Fewer%20Or%20Even%20None.md)**
  - Growth slows,  domestic capital outflows increase.
  - Export earnings fall,  leading to [asset price](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) declines and bank failures.
- **Policy Maker Challenges**
  - Worry about capital outflows and [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) collapse.
  - Central banks attempt to defend [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) by spending reserves or raising rates.
- **[Currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) Defense Failures**
  - Managed [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) declines rarely work due to [market expectations](../../../../../Clippings/Forward%20Rate.md).
  - Forward [currency price](../../../../The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) declines ahead of the spot price.
- **Capital Controls**
  - Often a last resort but usually fail due to investor circumvention.
  - Can temporarily fix issues but not sustain them.

### 4) The Depression (Often When the Currency Is Let Go)
- **Inflationary Deleveraging**
  - Analogous to a family struggling with payments.
  - Major difference is the scale and impact on national economies.
- **Economic Contraction**
  - Severe economic contraction due to high [interest rates](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and [currency depreciation](.md).

  - Previous discussions focused on deflationary debt crises.
  - Current focus is on inflationary debt crises,  using historical data from 27 worst cases.
- **Purpose of Study**
  - Understand the dynamics of inflationary depressions.
  - Explore the role of [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) devaluation in economic adjustments.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Currency and Debt Functions
- **Medium of Exchange and Store of Wealth**
  - [Currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) and debt serve as essential tools in [economic transactions](../../../../The%20Balance%20of%20Payments.md).
  - They facilitate trade and act as a measure of value over time.

### Debt Dynamics
- **Asset and Liability**
  - Debt represents a promise to pay,  creating obligations and assets.
  - Balancing these obligations is crucial to economic stability.

### Inflation and Interest Rates
- **Impact on Debt Holders**
  - [Inflation](../../Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) affects the real value of debt,  influencing interest rate [expectations](../../../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md).
  - Central banks manage money supply to stabilize [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) value.

### Debt Accumulation
- **Role of Central Banks**
  - Central banks and market participants create debt,  impacting economic cycles.
  - Proper management is essential to prevent economic depressions.

### Policy Makers' Role
- **Monetary and Fiscal Policies**
  - [Policy makers](Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) use these tools to balance economic forces.
  - [Currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) printing can relieve debt crises but may devalue [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).

## Currency Dynamics and Inflationary Depressions

### Currency Weakness
- **Depreciation and [Investor Behavior](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Runs%20On%20Money%20Market%20Mutual%20Funds.md)**
  - Rapid [currency depreciation](.md) leads to losses for debt holders.
  - Investors may shift to stronger currencies or tangible assets like gold.

### Central Bank Challenges
- **Interest Rate Adjustments**
  - Raising rates to counteract [currency weakness](Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) can be difficult.
  - Money outflows may tighten [credit markets](../../../../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%201.md) or necessitate more money printing.

### Trade-offs in Inflation and Growth
- **Balancing Act**
  - Central banks adjust [interest rates](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and [liquidity](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) to manage [inflation](../../Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and growth.
  - [Currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) demand influences these dynamics.

### Capital Outflows
- **Economic and Political Factors**
  - Unfavorable conditions can lead to capital flight.
  - This weakens the [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) and increases debt costs for foreign [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) borrowers.

## Vulnerability to Inflationary Deleveragings

### Factors Increasing Vulnerability
- **Economic Indicators**
  - Lack of [reserve currency status](../../../How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke-Chapter%2015%20&%20Chapter%2016.md),  low reserves,  and large foreign debt increase risk.
  - Budget deficits,  negative [real interest rates](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Aggregate%20Production.md),  and [inflation](../../Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) history are also factors.

### Iconic Case Study
- **[Weimar Republic](Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md)**
  - A historical example of severe inflationary contraction.

### Reserve-Currency Countries
- **Relative Stability**
  - Less prone to severe contractions but not immune to inflationary depressions.

## Phases of the Classic Inflationary Debt Cycle

### 1) The Early Part of the Cycle
- **Healthy Upswing**
  - [competitive](../../../../Globalization/Chapter%203-Comparative%20Advantage,%20Competitiveness,%20and%20the%20Terms%20of%20Trade.md) [fundamentals](../../../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md) attract [capital flows](../../../../Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md).
  - Low debt levels and strong balance sheets promote growth.
- **Capital Flows and [Currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) Demand**
  - Volatile but essential for economic health.
  - Strong [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) demand improves [balance of payments](../../../../The%20Balance%20of%20Payments.md).
- **Foreign-Exchange Reserves**
  - Accumulated to stabilize [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) markets and stimulate the economy.

### 2) The Bubble
- **Emergence and Dynamics**
  - Self-reinforcing cycle of [capital flows](../../../../Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) and [asset returns](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%201%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Overview/Some%20Stylized%20Empirical%20Facts%20About%20Asset%20Retur.md).
  - Asset prices rise,  often financed by debt,  leading to overvaluation.
- **[Investor Sentiment](Lecture%204-%20[[Lecture%204-%20Investor%20Sentiment)|[investor sentiment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%204-%20Investor%20Sentiment.md)]] and Market Conditions**
  - High optimism leads to overbought markets.
  - Foreign capital inflows and [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) positions become unsustainable.
- **Economic Growth and Debt**
  - Influx of capital finances consumption booms.
  - Rising debt burdens and deteriorating current accounts.

### 3) The Top and Currency Defense
- **Bubble Burst and Crisis Triggers**
  - Unsustainable [capital flows](../../../../Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) lead to [balance of payments](../../../../The%20Balance%20of%20Payments.md) crises.
  - Minor events can trigger significant economic shifts.
- **Capital Outflows and [Economic Impact](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Fewer%20Or%20Even%20None.md)**
  - Domestic capital seeks safety abroad,  weakening growth.
  - [Policy makers](Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) struggle to defend [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  often unsuccessfully.
- **[Currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) Defense Failures**
  - Managed declines rarely succeed; capital controls often fail.

### 4) The Depression (Currency Let Go)
- **Inflationary Deleveraging**
  - Severe economic contraction due to high [interest rates](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and [currency depreciation](.md).
- **Economic Contraction and Policy Challenges**
  - Growth slows,  job losses increase,  and spending declines.
  - Central banks face challenges in managing [inflation](../../Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and growth.
- **[Currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) Decline and [Inflation](../../Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)**
  - [Currency weakness](Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) leads to higher import prices and [inflation](../../Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md).
  - Persistent declines encourage capital withdrawal and speculation.

### 5) Normalization
- **Return to Balance**
  - Balance achieved through trade adjustments and [capital flows](../../../../Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md).
  - Central banks aim to make [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) holdings desirable again.
- **Policy Maker Strategies**
  - Produce positive total [returns](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) for [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) holders.
  - Allow [currency depreciation](.md) to stimulate the economy.
- **Economic Developments**
  - Collapse in imports improves [current account](../../../../Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md).
  - Capital inflows stabilize,  and [inflation](../../Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) decreases over time.

## Conclusion
- **Inflationary Depressions**
  - Result from complex interactions between [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) dynamics,  debt,  and policies.
  - Understanding these phases and vulnerabilities is crucial for economic stability.
- **Well-Managed vs. Poorly Managed Adjustments**
  - Effective management involves surprise devaluations and creating a two-way market.
  - Poor management leads to continued [currency weakness](Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) and economic pain.

## Closing External Imbalances

### Tight Monetary Policy
- **Domestic Demand Contraction**
  - Tight [Risk and Return](Lecture%207-[[Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds) of Bonds#7.6 [Asset price](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) reactions to [monetary policy](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) surprises|[monetary policy](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md)]] leads to reduced domestic demand.
  - Aligns with falling incomes to stabilize the economy.
- **Incentives for Investors**
  - Higher [interest rates](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) are used to retain investors in the [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).
  - Compensate for the risk of [currency depreciation](.md).
- **Policy Maker Preferences**
  - Favor domestic conditions with loose [Risk and Return](Lecture%207-[[Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds) of Bonds#7.6 [Asset price](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) reactions to [monetary policy](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) surprises|[monetary policy](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md)]].
  - Delay domestic pain,  potentially stoking [inflation](../../Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md).
- **Capital Controls**
  - Implemented to prevent capital outflows.
  - Restrictive measures may include capital controls.

### Smoothing the Downturn
- **Use of Reserves**
  - Reserves are used to manage foreign capital withdrawal.
  - Aim to maintain higher spending levels.

### Managing Bad Debts/Defaults
- **[Debt Management](../../Understanding%20Debt%20Crises%20and%20Their%20Management.md) Strategies**
  - Address over-indebted entities by providing alternative credit.
  - Allow disorderly defaults,  increasing uncertainty and capital flight.
- **Recovery Timeline**
  - Recovery typically takes a few years.
  - Initial reluctance from investors due to past losses.

## Recovery and New Economic Cycle

### Attracting Foreign Investment
- **[Currency Depreciation](.md) Benefits**
  - Lower domestic goods and labor prices attract foreign [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).
  - Capital inflows resume,  boosting exports and growth.
- **Financial Institution Support**
  - Recapitalizing critical [financial institutions](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) aids recovery.
  - Supports a new cycle of productive [investment](../../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and growth.

### Economic Growth and Capital Inflows
- **Incomes and Spending**
  - Incomes and spending increase within one to two years.
  - Full recovery to average activity levels takes about three years.
- **[Currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) Valuation**
  - Real FX remains undervalued,  aiding export growth.
  - Capital inflows return gradually over four to five years.
- **Equity Market Recovery**
  - Equities recover in foreign [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) terms over a similar timeframe.

## The Spiral from Inflationary Depression to Hyperinflation

### Characteristics of Hyperinflation
- **Policy Maker Actions**
  - Failure to close external imbalances leads to hyperinflation.
  - Sustained money printing to fund external spending exacerbates the issue.
- **Historical Example: [Weimar Germany](.md)**
  - External [debt service](../../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) burdens led to inevitable [inflation](../../Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) problems.
  - [Policy makers](Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises.md) chose money printing over spending cuts.

### Inflationary Spiral Dynamics
- **[Currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) Decline and [Inflation](../../Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) Psychology**
  - [Currency depreciation](.md) leads to capital flight and [inflation](../../Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md).
  - Inflationary psychology sets in,  altering economic behavior.
- **Wage-Cost Spiral**
  - Workers demand higher wages,  leading to increased prices.
  - Wage indexing can exacerbate the cycle.
- **[Investor Behavior](../../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Runs%20On%20Money%20Market%20Mutual%20Funds.md)**
  - Shift from domestic investments to real and foreign assets.
  - Savers and investors protect purchasing power by [shorting](../../../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Short%20Selling.md) cash.

### Consequences of Hyperinflation
- **Economic and Social Impact**

- **Creditworthiness and Capital Markets**
  - A country's ability to borrow depends on its creditworthiness and capital [market development](../../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Variance%20Swaps.md).
  - Local [currency](../../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) debt market soundness is crucial.
- **Non-Financial Resources**
