# Inflationary Debt Crisis Lecture Notes

## Introduction to Inflationary Debt Crises

1. **[[Overview of Financial Markets|Overview]] of Inflationary Debt Crises**
   - Inflationary debt crises are characterized by the devaluation of [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] and rising [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]].
   - These crises are distinct from deflationary debt crises,  which involve falling prices and economic contraction.
   - The archetypal [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|inflationary debt crisis]] is derived from averaging 27 significant historical inflationary cycles.

1. **Comparison with Historical Cases**
   - The [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Weimar Republic]]'s hyperinflation is a notable historical example.
   - Studying such cases provides insights into the dynamics of inflationary crises.

## Fundamental Concepts

1. **[[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|Currency and Debt Functions]]**
   - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] and debt serve as:
	 - [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Mediums of exchange]].
	 - Stores of wealth.
   - Debt represents both an asset and a liability.
	 - It is a promise to pay in a specific [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] (e.g.,  dollars,  euros).

1. **[[Inflationary Debt Crisis Lecture Notes|Debt Holders' Expectations]]**
   - Debt holders expect to convert debt into money and subsequently into goods and services.
   - They are sensitive to:
	 - [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|Inflation]] rates affecting purchasing power.
	 - [[Interest Rate Quotations|Interest rates]] as compensation for holding debt.

1. **Central Banks' Role**
   - Central banks produce money and credit in their respective currencies.
   - They work symbiotically with borrowers and lenders to manage debt levels.
   - The challenge is to prevent the debt pile from leading to either deflationary or inflationary depressions.

## Policy Makers and Central Banks

1. **Balancing Opposing Forces**
   - [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Policy makers]] have significant power to redistribute burdens during debt crises.
   - Central banks often print [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to relieve debt crises,  stimulating spending but devaluing the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].

1. **[[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Dynamics**
   - If a [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] depreciates faster than its interest rate,  debt holders incur losses.
   - This dynamic can lead to inflationary depressions.

## Investor Behavior and Currency Dynamics

1. **Investor Reactions to [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Currency Weakness]]**
   - Investors may sell debt in a weakening [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] and move assets to stronger currencies or non-[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] stores of wealth (e.g.,  gold).

1. **Central Bank Dilemmas**
   - In times of economic weakness,  central banks struggle to raise [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] enough to counteract [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]].
   - This can lead to capital flight,  where money leaves the country for safer investments.

1. **Central Bank Responses**
   - Central banks face a choice between allowing [[Credit Markets Session 1|credit markets]] to tighten or printing more money.
   - [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Printing money]] can exacerbate inflationary pressures.

## Managing Inflation and Growth

1. **Trade-offs in [[The Economist Regime Change|Monetary Policy]]**
   - Central banks manage [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] and growth by adjusting [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] and [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]].
   - These trade-offs are easier when money flows into a country's [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]/debt.
   - They become more challenging when money flows out,  leading to potential inflationary depressions.

## Conclusion

1. **Understanding Inflationary Depressions**
   - Inflationary depressions result from complex interactions between [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] dynamics,  [[Runs On Money Market Mutual Funds|investor behavior]],  and central bank policies.
   - Effective management requires balancing inflationary pressures with economic growth objectives.

# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Dynamics

## Demand for Currency and Debt

1. **Impact of Demand on [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]]/Debt**
   - Increased demand for a country's [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]/debt:
	 - Pushes [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]/debt prices up.
	 - Leads to lower [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] and higher growth,  assuming stable money and credit supply.
   - Decreased demand has the opposite effect:
	 - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]]/debt prices fall.
	 - [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|Inflation]] rises and growth slows.

1. **Central Bank's Role in Managing Demand**
   - Central banks influence [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] and [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] through policy levers.
   - The balance between [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]] and interest rate adjustments is crucial.
   - In times of capital outflow:
	 - [[Real Interest Rates and Aggregate Production|Real interest rates]] need to rise less if real exchange rates fall more.

## Capital Outflows and Currency Weakness

1. **Causes of Capital Outflows**
   - Occur in inhospitable environments:
	 - Economic,  debt,  or political issues.
   - Lead to significant [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]].

1. **Consequences of [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Currency Weakness]]**
   - Increases debt costs for those borrowing in stronger currencies.
   - Further weakens the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] relative to stronger ones.
   - Countries with severe debt problems and foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] debt are most vulnerable.

## Inflationary Depressions and Currency Weakness

1. **Mechanism of [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|Inflation]] in Depressions**
   - [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Currency weakness]] leads to [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] during depressions.
   - The cycle ends when:
	 - Debts are defaulted or money is created to ease the squeeze.
	 - [[Notes on Currency Swaps|Debt service]] requirements are reduced (e.g.,  forbearance).
	 - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] depreciates more than [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]],  improving competitiveness.

1. **Role of Politics in Economic Adjustments**
   - Political factors can hinder or facilitate economic adjustments.
   - Severe political issues can lead to prolonged [[How the Eggheads Cracked|economic downturns]].

## Vulnerability to Inflationary Deleveragings

1. **Characteristics of Vulnerable Countries**
   - Lack of a reserve [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].
   - Low foreign-exchange reserves.
   - Large foreign debt.
   - Large and increasing budget/[[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deficits.
   - Negative [[Real Interest Rates and Aggregate Production|real interest rates]].
   - History of high [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] and negative [[Assets|returns]].

1. **Iconic Case Studies**
   - The [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Weimar Republic]] in the 1920s is a classic example.
   - Differences between Weimar,  the US [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment 1928-1937|Great Depression]],  and 2007–2011 are explored in further studies.

## Reserve-Currency Countries and Inflationary Depressions

1. **Potential for Inflationary Depressions**
   - Less likely in reserve-[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] countries without significant foreign-[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] debt.
   - Can occur after prolonged overuse of economic stimulation.
   - Typically emerge later in the deleveraging process.

## Conclusion

1. **Understanding Inflationary Depressions**
   - Result from complex interactions between [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] dynamics,  [[Runs On Money Market Mutual Funds|investor behavior]],  and central bank policies.
   - Effective management requires balancing inflationary pressures with economic growth objectives.
   - Political stability is crucial for successful economic adjustments.

# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Dynamics

## Reserve-Currency Countries and Inflationary Depressions

1. **Potential for Inflationary Depressions in Reserve-[[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Countries**
   - Even reserve-[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] countries can experience capital outflows.
	 - This affects the trade-off between [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] and growth.
   - Allowing higher [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] to maintain growth can:
	 - Undermine demand for the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].
	 - Erode [[How Countries Go Broke-Chapter 15 & Chapter 16|reserve currency status]].
	 - Transform deleveraging into an inflationary one.

## The Phases of the Classic Inflationary Debt Cycle

1. **[[Overview of Financial Markets|Overview]] of [[Part 1 The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle|Inflationary Debt Cycle]]**
   - Inflationary deleveragings follow five stages,  similar to deflationary ones but with key differences.
   - The archetype is based on 27 historical inflationary deleveragings with foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] debt.
   - Comparison with hyperinflationary cases highlights differences.

1. **Stages of Inflationary Deleveraging**
   - The cycle mirrors deflationary deleveragings until the depression stage.

### 1) The Early Part of the Cycle

1. **Healthy Upswing**
   - Favorable [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] due to strong [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|fundamentals]].
	 - Competitiveness and potential for productive [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]].
   - Low debt levels and healthy balance sheets.
	 - Stimulates export sales and attracts foreign capital.
	 - Funds investments yielding productive growth.

1. **Capital Flows and Economic Growth**
   - Capital flows are volatile and crucial to monitor.
   - Early cycle characteristics:
	 - Debt and incomes rise at comparable rates.
	 - Strong [[Class Note 1- Borrower-Lender conflicts and implied agency problems|debt and equity]] markets encourage [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]].
	 - Borrowing by private sector,  government,  and banks is rational due to rising incomes.

1. **Positive,  Self-Reinforcing Cycle**
   - Improved [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] demand enhances the cycle.
	 - Attractive opportunities for foreign investors.
	 - Favorable [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] due to export surplus.
   - Central bank benefits:
	 - More growth per unit of [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]].
	 - Options to appreciate [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  lower [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]],  or increase reserves.

1. **Central Bank Interventions**
   - Some central banks intervene in foreign exchange markets.
	 - Sell domestic [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] for foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to prevent appreciation.
   - Use acquired foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to buy [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] assets (e.g.,  bonds).
	 - Stored in foreign-exchange reserves.
	 - Reserves act as savings to cushion [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] market movements.

By understanding these phases and dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of inflationary depressions and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] dynamics.

# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Dynamics

## Reserve Accumulation and Economic Stimulation

1. **Strategic Use of Reserves**
   - Central banks can use reserves to purchase desirable [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] assets.
   - These assets may offer strategic [[Assets|returns]] or enhance economic stability.

1. **Economic Stimulation through Reserve Accumulation**
   - Accumulating reserves reduces upward pressure on the domestic [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].
	 - This maintains export competitiveness.
	 - It injects more money into the economy.

1. **Mechanism of Reserve Accumulation**
   - Central banks create more domestic [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to buy foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].
	 - This increases the domestic money supply.
	 - Funds can be used to buy assets,  causing asset prices to rise.
	 - Alternatively,  funds can be lent out,  stimulating economic activity.

1. **Attractiveness of [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] [[Assets|Returns]]**
   - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] [[Assets|returns]] become attractive due to:
	 - Foreign buyers needing to exchange their [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] for the local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].
	 - Central banks increasing the supply of domestic [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  boosting asset prices in local terms.

1. **Impact of Favorable [[The Balance of Payments|Balance of Payments]]**
   - A favorable [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] leads to:
	 - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] appreciation and/or increased foreign-exchange reserves.
	 - Economic stimulation and rising markets.
	 - Investors benefiting from [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] [[Assets|returns]] and asset appreciation.

1. **[[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Appreciation vs. Asset Appreciation**
   - As the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] appreciates,  asset appreciation may slow down.
   - The balance between [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] and [[Some Stylized Empirical Facts About Asset Retur|asset returns]] is crucial for investors.

## The Bubble Phase

1. **Emergence of the Bubble**
   - Bubbles form during virtuous cycles of strong [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] and [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007–2011)|economic conditions]].
   - Initial capital inflows produce good [[Assets|returns]],  attracting more capital.

1. **Characteristics of the Bubble Phase**
   - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] and asset prices are bid up,  often financed by debt.
   - Prices become too high to yield adequate [[Assets|returns]],  yet borrowing continues.
   - Debts rise rapidly relative to incomes.

1. **Self-Reinforcing Nature of Bubbles**
   - Inflows strengthen the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  making local assets desirable.
   - Money creation leads to rising prices,  further attracting [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]].
   - Total [[Assets|returns]] for foreign investors (asset prices + [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] appreciation) are attractive.

1. **Economic and Market Dynamics**
   - The country becomes a hot [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] destination.
   - Assets become overbought,  leading to debt and stock-market bubbles.
   - Investors rush in,  fearing missing out on lucrative opportunities.

1. **Indicators of an Inflating Bubble**
   - High foreign [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]],  averaging around 10% of GDP.
   - Central bank accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves.
   - Real FX becomes overvalued by approximately 15% on a PPP basis.
   - Stock markets rally,  often over 20% annually leading to the peak.

1. **Risks of a Fully Long and Leveraged Market**
   - When markets are fully long,  leveraged,  and overpriced,  they are ripe for reversal.
   - The cycle of inflows and rising prices can reverse,  leading to potential downturns.

By understanding these phases and dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of inflationary depressions and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] dynamics.

# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Dynamics

## Motivations and Positions in Currency Markets

1. **Participants' Motivations to Be Long in [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]]**
   - Most participants are motivated to be long the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] of a country experiencing a sustained [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] wave.
   - This position is often taken implicitly or without full recognition.

1. **Foreign Businesses' [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Strategies**
   - Foreign businesses setting up operations in a booming country may:
	 - Fund activities with their own [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to maintain liabilities in a potentially weaker [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].
	 - Prefer to hold deposits in the local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].
	 - Avoid [[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|hedging]] [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] exposures from local sales revenues.

1. **Local Businesses' Borrowing Practices**
   - Local businesses might borrow in weaker foreign currencies.
   - Foreign bankers are eager to lend due to the hot market conditions.

1. **Mechanisms Leading to Long Positions in Local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]]**
   - Sustained bull markets lead multinational entities to long positions in local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] through various channels:
	 - Influx of foreign capital finances a consumption boom.
	 - Imports rise faster than exports,  worsening the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]].

## Economic Growth and Investment Dynamics

1. **[[An Asset Allocation Primer|Investment]] and Growth Dynamics**
   - [[An Asset Allocation Primer|Investment]] in the country leads to strong growth and rising incomes.
   - Borrowers become more creditworthy,  and lenders are more willing to lend.

1. **Role of Export Prices**
   - High export prices,  often for [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|commodities]],  increase national income and incentivize [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]].

1. **Emergence of the Bubble**
   - As the bubble emerges,  fewer productive investments are available.
   - More capital chases these limited opportunities.

1. **Erosion of Competitiveness**
   - Rising [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] erodes the country's competitiveness.
   - Growth increasingly relies on debt rather than productivity gains.
   - The country becomes reliant on foreign financing.

## Foreign Currency Debt and Economic Indicators

1. **Foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Debt Dynamics**
   - Foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]-denominated debt rises.
   - Emerging countries often borrow abroad in foreign currencies due to:
	 - Underdeveloped local financial systems.
	 - Less faith in local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] lending.
	 - Limited domestic savings for lending.

1. **Asset Prices and Economic Strength**
   - Asset prices rise,  and the economy remains strong.
   - This leads to higher spending and obligations to pay foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] debt.

1. **[[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment 1928-1937|Debt Cycle]] Dynamics**
   - Positive effects of debt cycles appear first,  followed by negative effects.
   - Debt burdens rise rapidly.

1. **Debt and GDP Indicators**
   - Debt to GDP rises at about 10% annually over three years.
   - Foreign-[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] debt averages around 35% of total debt and 45% of GDP.
   - Economic activity is strong,  with GDP growth above potential,  leading to tight capacity.

## Archetype of Inflationary Deleveraging

1. **Archetype Charts and Economic Activity**
   - Charts illustrate debt and [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] trends in 27 inflationary deleveraging cases.
   - The "zero" point on charts represents the peak in economic activity.

1. **Bubble Phase Characteristics**
   - During the bubble,  debt as a percentage of GDP rises from 125% to 150%.
   - The [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deteriorates by about 2% of GDP.

1. **Income and Spending Gap**
   - The gap between the country's income and spending widens.
   - Increasing capital inflows are needed to sustain growth in spending.

1. **Fragility at the Cycle's Peak**
   - Economic activity remains strong at the cycle's peak due to continued inflows.
   - [[FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE|Expectations]] of high growth drive asset prices and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] strength.
   - The country becomes fragile,  and minor events can trigger reversals.

## Summary of Conditions Leading to Inflationary Deleveragings

1. **Conditions Through Economic Upswings**
   - The conditions leading to the 27 inflationary deleveragings include:
	 - Strong capital inflows.
	 - Rising asset prices and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] appreciation.
	 - Increasing reliance on foreign financing.
	 - Growing debt burdens and economic fragility.

By understanding these dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of inflationary depressions and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] dynamics.

# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Dynamics

## Case Analysis: Foreign-Denominated Debt and Economic Outcomes

1. **Differentiation of Cases**
   - Cases are categorized based on:
	 - Levels of foreign-denominated debt.
	 - Severity of economic outcomes.
	   - Measured by declines in growth and equity prices.
	   - Increases in unemployment and [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]].

1. **Correlation with Economic Pain**
   - Countries with high external reliance and significant asset bubbles:
	 - Experienced the most severe [[How the Eggheads Cracked|economic downturns]].
	 - Suffered from extreme declines in growth and equity prices.
	 - Faced sharp increases in unemployment and [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]].

## The Top and Currency Defense

1. **Bubble Burst and Reversal**
   - The top-reversal/[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]-defense phase begins when:
	 - The bubble bursts.
	 - High [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] levels,  asset prices,  and debt growth rates become unsustainable.

1. **Cycle Reversal Dynamics**
   - A mirror-opposite cycle from the upswing is set in motion:
	 - Weakening capital inflows and asset prices.
	 - Deteriorating [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007–2011)|economic conditions]].
	 - Further weakening of [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] and asset prices.

1. **[[The Balance of Payments|Balance of Payments]] Crisis and Inflationary Depression**
   - The spiral leads to:
	 - A [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] crisis.
	 - An inflationary depression.

1. **Triggering Events**
   - Optimism at the top makes the economy vulnerable to minor events:
	 - Slowing foreign capital inflows.
	 - Increasing domestic capital outflows.

1. **Role of Trade Balances and Capital Flows**
   - Worsening trade balances contribute to the crisis:
	 - High [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] levels and excessive domestic consumption lead to high imports.
   - Adverse shifts in [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] are more critical.

## Causes of Top-Reversal

1. **Income and Credit Shocks**
   - Similar to financial difficulties faced by families or individuals:
	 - Loss of income or credit tightening.
	 - Big increases in costs (e.g.,  rising gasoline or heating oil prices).
	 - Difficulty in repaying borrowed amounts.

1. **Typical Crisis Cycle**
   - Crisis arises from the unsustainable pace of capital inflows slowing.
   - Often triggered by a shock (e.g.,  decline in oil prices for an oil producer).

1. **Categories of Causes**
   - **Income Drops from Exports**
	 - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] appreciation makes exports expensive.
	 - Commodity-exporting countries suffer from falling [[Primary vs. Secondary Commodities|commodity prices]].
   - **Rising Costs of Imports or Borrowing**
   - **Declines in Capital Inflows**
	 - Foreign investors reduce net lending or [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]].
	 - Causes include:
	   - Natural slowing of unsustainable pace.
	   - Economic or political concerns.
	   - Tightening of [[Lecture 7-[[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds|Risk and Return]] of Bonds#7.6 [[A Preview of Alternative Formulations|Asset price]] reactions to [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] surprises|[[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]]]] locally or abroad.
   - **Domestic Capital Flight**
	 - Citizens or companies seek to move money out of the country/[[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].

## Balance of Payments Crisis Dynamics

1. **Initial Weakening of Capital Flows**
   - Often the first sign of a [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] crisis.
   - Directly causes growth to weaken:
	 - Reduced [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] and consumption financing.

1. **Self-Reinforcing Weakening**
   - Domestic borrowers appear less creditworthy.
   - Foreigners become less willing to lend and provide capital.

1. **Economic Consequences**
   - Growth slows relative to potential as capital inflows slow.
   - Domestic capital outflows increase.
   - Export earnings fall due to:
	 - Falling prices.
	 - Decreased quantities sold.

By understanding these dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of inflationary depressions and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] dynamics.

# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Dynamics

## Economic Slowdown and Capital Outflows

1. **Stagnation in Exports**
   - Exports typically plateau,  ceasing to rise.
   - This stagnation is a precursor to economic slowdown.

1. **Impact on Capital and Income Flows**
   - Shifts in capital and income flows lead to:
	 - Decline in asset prices.
	 - Increase in [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]].
   - These changes slow economic growth,  which was previously bolstered by capital inflows.

1. **Deterioration of Company [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|Fundamentals]]**
   - Worsening [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|fundamentals]] of companies drive further capital outflows.
   - This creates a negative feedback loop,  exacerbating economic challenges.

## Debt Bust and Banking Failures

1. **Onset of a Debt Bust**
   - The economy experiences a debt bust characterized by:
	 - Falling asset prices.
	 - Bank failures.

1. **Increased Anxiety Among Stakeholders**
   - Asset and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] holders worry about potential restrictions on capital movement.
   - [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Policy makers]] are concerned about capital outflows and potential [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] collapse.

1. **[[The Balance of Payments|Balance of Payments]] Deterioration**
   - As the [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] worsens,  central banks face increased challenges:
	 - [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|Currency depreciation]].
	 - Rising [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]].
	 - Declining reserves.

## Central Bank Currency Defense Strategies

1. **Typical [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Defense Measures**
   - Central banks attempt to defend currencies by:
	 - Spending down reserves to fill the [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] deficit.
	 - Raising [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]].

1. **Ineffectiveness of [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Defenses**
   - These measures often fail because:
	 - Selling reserves and raising [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] create opportunities for sellers.
	 - They do not achieve the necessary [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] and interest rate levels for sustainable [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007–2011)|economic conditions]].

1. **Critical Relationship in [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Markets**
   - The relationship between interest rate differences and spot/forward [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] is crucial.
   - Expected [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]] is reflected in the [[Forward Contracts and Forward Prices|forward price]] being lower than the spot price.

## Interest Rate and Currency Depreciation Dynamics

1. **Interest Rate Adjustments and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] [[FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE|Expectations]]**
   - If the market expects a 5% [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]] over a year,  the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] must yield a 5% higher interest rate.
   - Short-term depreciation [[FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE|expectations]] require even higher interest rate adjustments.

1. **[[The Economist Fewer Or Even None|Economic Impact]] of High [[Interest Rate Quotations|Interest Rates]]**
   - High [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]],  necessary to counteract expected depreciation,  can severely contract an already weak economy.
   - A 5% monthly interest rate equates to an annual rate of about 80%,  which is unsustainable.

1. **Consequences of Managed [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Decline**
   - Managed [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines with falling reserves lead to [[FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE|expectations]] of continued depreciation.
   - This pushes up domestic [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]],  tightening the economy further.

## Capital Withdrawals and Speculation

1. **Increased Capital Withdrawals**
   - [[FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE|Expectations]] of continued devaluation encourage capital withdrawals and speculation.
   - This widens the [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] gap.

1. **Central Bank Reserve Spending**
   - Central banks are forced to spend more reserves to defend the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].
   - Eventually,  reserve spending must stop to avoid depleting savings.

1. **Policy Maker Responses**
   - [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Policy makers]] often make confident statements to reassure markets.
   - These actions typically precede the next stage of the cycle: letting the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] float.

## Forward Currency Pricing and Monetary Policy

1. **Forward [[The Foreign Exchange Market Annotations|Currency Price]] Dynamics**
   - During [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] defense,  forward [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] prices often decline ahead of [[Contango And Backwardation In Arbitrage-Free Futures-Markets|spot prices]].
   - This reflects the interest rate differential and spot/forward [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] relationship.

1. **[[The Economist Regime Change|Monetary Policy]] Tightening**
   - Tightening [[Lecture 7-[[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds|Risk and Return]] of Bonds#7.6 [[A Preview of Alternative Formulations|Asset price]] reactions to [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] surprises|[[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]]]] to support the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] increases the interest rate differential.
   - This artificially holds up the spot [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] but exacerbates economic weakness.

By understanding these dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of inflationary depressions and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] dynamics.

# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Dynamics

## Currency Defense and Forward Currency Pricing

1. **Forward [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|Pricing]] Dynamics**
   - Forward [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] prices often decline ahead of [[Contango And Backwardation In Arbitrage-Free Futures-Markets|spot prices]] during [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] defense.
   - This reflects the interest rate differential and spot/forward [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] relationship.

1. **Whip-like Effect in [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Markets**
   - The forward tends to lead the spot downward as the interest rate differential increases.
   - The spot eventually catches up after the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] is let go.
   - [[The Fall of Bear Stearns Lost Opportunities Haunt Final Days of Bear Stearns; Executives Bickeredover Raising Cash Cutting Mortgages|The fall]] in the [[Arbitrage Opportunity Accounting|spot exchange rate]] allows the interest differential to narrow.
   - This mechanically causes the forward to rally relative to the spot.

1. **Role of Capital Controls**
   - Capital controls are a third,  often last-ditch lever that seldom works.
   - They can seem attractive to policymakers as they directly reduce capital outflows.
   - However,  they usually fail because:
	 - Investors find ways to circumvent them.
	 - [[The Dodd Frank Act and Its Impact|The act]] of trying to trap capital leads to increased desire to escape.
   - The inability to move money out of a country is analogous to a [[Bank Runs Deposit Insurance and Liquidity|bank run]].
   - Capital controls can be a temporary fix but not a sustained solution.

1. **[[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|Duration]] of [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Defense Phase**
   - This phase is typically brief,  lasting around six months.
   - Reserves are drawn down by about 10 to 20 percent before the defense is abandoned.

## The Depression Phase (Often When the Currency Is Let Go)

1. **Analogy to Family Financial Troubles**
   - A country's inflationary deleveraging is analogous to a family struggling with payments.
   - Unlike a family,  a country can change the amount of [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] that exists,  affecting its value.
   - This creates a lever for managing [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] pressures.

1. **Impact of [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Devaluation**
   - Devaluation changes the price of a country's goods and services for foreigners.
   - It allows countries to offer price cuts to the rest of the world without domestic deflation.
   - A 30 percent [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] devaluation equates to a 30 percent pay cut relative to the world,  not domestically.

1. **[[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Policy Makers]]' Response to [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Pressures**
   - After unsustainable [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] support (e.g.,  expending reserves,  tightening [[Lecture 7-[[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds|Risk and Return]] of Bonds#7.6 [[A Preview of Alternative Formulations|Asset price]] reactions to [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] surprises|[[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]]]],  imposing controls),  policymakers typically let the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] decline.
   - They generally try to smooth its fall.

1. **Typical Outcomes After [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Is Let Go**
   - The [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] experiences a significant initial depreciation,  averaging around 30 percent in real terms.
   - The decline is not offset by tighter short rates,  leading to significant losses from holding the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] (around 30 percent in the first year).
   - Policymakers attempt to smooth the decline by continuing to spend down reserves (by another 10 percent for a year into the bust).

1. **Central Banks' Strategy in [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Defense**
   - Central banks should avoid defending currencies to the point of depleting reserves or raising [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] excessively.
   - The dangers of low reserves and high [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] outweigh the dangers of devaluation.
   - Devaluations are stimulative for the economy and markets,  which is beneficial during economic contraction.

By understanding these dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of inflationary depressions and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] dynamics.

# Currency Decline and Economic Adjustments

## Effects of Currency Decline

1. **Asset Valuation and Export Stimulation**
   - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] decline tends to increase the value of assets when measured in the weakened [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].
   - It stimulates export sales by making goods cheaper for foreign buyers.
   - Helps [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] adjustment by aligning spending with income.

1. **Impact on Imports and Domestic Production**
   - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] decline makes imports more expensive,  reducing their volume.
   - This shift favors domestic producers by increasing demand for locally produced goods.
   - Assets in the weakened [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] become more competitively priced and attractive to investors.

1. **Profit Margins and Export Competitiveness**
   - Exported goods benefit from better profit margins due to lower production costs in foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] terms.
   - Sets the stage for increased income from abroad through more [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] exports.

## Double-Edged Nature of Currency Declines

1. **Policy Management and Economic Pain**
   - The way policymakers manage [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines significantly affects the economic adjustment's severity.
   - Poor management can exacerbate economic pain during the adjustment period.

1. **Inflationary Impact of [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Declines**
   - [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Currency weakness]] leads to higher prices for imported goods,  contributing to [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]].
   - Much of the increased cost is passed on to consumers,  resulting in a sharp rise in [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]].

1. **Gradual vs. One-Off Devaluation**
   - Gradual and persistent [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines lead to [[FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE|expectations]] of continued depreciation.
	 - Encourages capital withdrawal and speculation,  widening the [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] gap.
	 - Makes [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] more persistent,  feeding an [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] psychology.
   - A large,  one-off devaluation is generally preferable.
	 - Establishes a two-way market for the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  reducing [[FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE|expectations]] of further weakening.
	 - Higher [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] is less likely to be sustained.

## Policy Maker Strategies and Market Reactions

1. **Surprise Devaluation Benefits**
   - If a one-off devaluation is unexpected,  policymakers avoid spending reserves or raising [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] to defend the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].
   - This strategy is why policymakers often claim they will defend the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] until they stop doing so.

1. **Post-Devaluation Dynamics**
   - After letting the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] go,  savers are stung,  creating [[FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE|expectations]] and fears of further devaluation.
   - People rush to exit their positions in the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  leading to self-sustaining reversals.

1. **Asset-Liability Mismatches**
   - Many had acquired mismatches that were profitable but become unprofitable when the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] weakens.
   - The reversal forces spending to stop as capital becomes unavailable.

## Economic Ripple Effects

1. **Impact on Spending and Income**
   - The cessation of spending affects income,  causing job losses and reduced spending.
   - Economic growth grinds to a halt.

1. **Debt Problems and Capital Inflows**
   - Domestic banks face debt issues,  and foreigners become less willing to lend.
   - Capital inflows dry up,  falling by more than 5% of GDP in less than 12 months.
   - Capital outflows continue at a pace of -3 to -5% of GDP.

1. **Central Bank Printing Limitations**
   - Central banks are cautious about [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|printing money]],  as it risks worsening capital flight.
   - Printing is limited to 1-2% of GDP on average.

## Market Reactions and Asset Performance

1. **[[Runs On Money Market Mutual Funds|Investor Behavior]] and Asset Valuation**
   - Weaker growth prompts investors to withdraw funds,  turning previously valuable assets into liabilities.
   - Assets quickly transition from overbought to oversold,  causing prices to plummet.

1. **[[Interest Rate Quotations|Interest Rates]] and Yield Curve**
   - Nominal short rates rise,  typically by about 20 percentage points,  and the yield curve inverts.

1. **Equity Market Performance**
   - Equities in local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] terms fall by around 50% on average.
   - Perform worse in foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] terms due to [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] decline exacerbating the equity sell-off.

## Foreign-Denominated Debt Mismatches

1. **Significance of Foreign-Denominated Debt**
   - One of the most critical asset/liability mismatches is foreign-denominated debt.
   - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] decline increases the burden of foreign-denominated debt,  exacerbating economic challenges.

By understanding these dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines and their impact on inflationary depressions.

# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Dynamics

## Rising Debt Burden Due to Currency Depreciation

1. **Impact on Debtors with Foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Debt**
   - As the local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] depreciates,  the debt burden for those owing foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] debt increases when measured in local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].
   - Debtors typically respond by:
	 - Selling local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to repay debts.
	 - Putting on hedges to protect against further depreciation.
	 - Moving savings into foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].
   - These actions contribute to further downward pressure on the local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].

1. **Consequences of Rising [[Notes on Currency Swaps|Debt Service]]**
   - [[Notes on Currency Swaps|Debt service]] costs rise significantly,  often exceeding 5% of GDP.
	 - This is due to falling incomes and increased foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]-denominated [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] in local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] terms.
   - The squeeze on incomes and spending intensifies.

1. **Foreign Exchange (FX) Debt Burdens**
   - FX debt burdens increase for those who borrowed in foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].
	 - Debt-to-GDP ratios rise by about 20% due to declining incomes and [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]].

## Inflationary Pressures from Currency Decline

1. **[[War Economies and Hyperinflation|Inflation]] Dynamics**
   - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] declines lead to higher import costs,  driving up [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]].
   - [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|Inflation]] typically rises by 15%,  peaking around 30%.
   - Elevated [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] persists for about two years from the peak.

1. **Economic and Political Reinforcement**
   - Various problems—debt,  economic,  political,  [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]—reinforce each other.
   - Hidden issues like fraudulent accounting and corruption often surface during such times.

## Hitting the Bottom: The Catharsis Phase

1. **[[Runs On Money Market Mutual Funds|Investor Behavior]] and Market Dynamics**
   - The environment discourages foreign [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] and encourages domestic capital flight.
   - The bottom is the opposite of the bubble stage,  where investors aggressively exit positions.
   - Panic selling leads to a supply/demand imbalance,  driving prices lower.

1. **Severity of the Downward Spiral**
   - This phase is the most severe and painful part of inflationary deleveraging.
   - The self-reinforcing downward spiral is rapid and intense.

1. **Catharsis and Economic Renewal**
   - "Hitting bottom" is so painful that it triggers radical changes in [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] and policies.
   - This crisis sows the seeds for change and renewal,  akin to a catharsis in theater or personal life.

## Economic Adjustments and Recovery

1. **Restoration of [[The Balance of Payments|Balance of Payments]]**
   - The [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]'s cheapness leads to substantial cuts in import spending,  restoring [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]].
   - International aid (e.g.,  from the IMF,  BIS) may assist in necessary adjustments.

1. **Political and Economic Shifts**
   - Significant political shifts often occur,  moving from poor policies to sound economic strategies.
   - Key economic developments include:
	 - A significant fall in economic activity (GDP gap) by about 8%.
	 - Rising unemployment.
	 - The bottom in activity occurs after about one year,  with the GDP gap trough near -4%.

## Normalization and Return to Stability

1. **Achieving [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Balance**
   - Normalization occurs when there is a balance between [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] supply and demand relative to other currencies.
   - This balance is achieved through trade adjustments and,  more importantly,  [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]].

1. **Policy Maker Strategies for [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Stability**
   - To retain capital,  policymakers must make it desirable to hold the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].
   - They need to ensure a positive total return for the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] at an acceptable interest rate.
	 - The interest rate should not be too high for domestic conditions.

By understanding these dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of inflationary depressions and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] dynamics,  ultimately leading to economic stabilization and recovery.

# Currency Defense and Economic Strategy

## The Currency Defense Phase

1. **Common Misconceptions**
   - Many believe defending the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] is the best strategy during the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] defense phase.
   - However,  allowing the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to depreciate sharply and quickly is often more beneficial.

1. **Benefits of [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|Currency Depreciation]]**
   - A lower [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] level can:
	 - Improve the trade balance.
	 - Produce a positive total return.
	 - Align [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] with domestic conditions.

1. **Investor Attraction Post-Devaluation**
   - Depreciation makes the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] more attractive to investors:
	 - Total [[Assets|returns]] (spot [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] appreciation + interest rate difference) are likely positive.
	 - A sharply depreciated [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] level requires a lower interest rate to attract investors.

## Ensuring Positive Total Returns

1. **Depreciation Strategy**
   - Depreciating the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] enough ensures positive total [[Assets|returns]] at a relatively low real interest rate.
   - This is crucial for weak domestic conditions.

1. **Influence of [[The Balance of Payments|Balance of Payments]] and Central Bank Policies**
   - [[The Balance of Payments|Balance of payments]] [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|fundamentals]] and central bank actions determine [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] [[Assets|returns]].
   - These factors influence investor willingness to own or short the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].

1. **Risks of [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Devaluation**
   - Devaluing currencies is akin to using cocaine:
	 - Provides short-term stimulation.
	 - Can be ruinous if abused.

1. **Central Bank's Role**
   - Central banks must balance [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]] with tight policies to make [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] ownership attractive.
   - Monitoring central bank actions is crucial before taking long positions.

## Avoiding Inflationary Spirals

1. **Investor Confidence and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Stability**
   - Prolonged negative [[Assets|returns]] and continuous [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] decline can lead to inflationary spirals.
   - Central banks should aim for a [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] level that stimulates the economy and balances payments.

1. **Chart Analysis**
   - [[Assets|Returns]] to holding the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] for foreigners start negative but improve about a year post-devaluation.

## Managing Debt and Liquidity

1. **Debt Limits and Systemic Institutions**
   - Even if a country hasn't hit its debt limits,  certain entities may have.
   - Policymakers must recapitalize important institutions and provide targeted [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]].

1. **Targeted [[Bank Runs Deposit Insurance and Liquidity|Liquidity Provision]]**
   - [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|Printing money]] to provide [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] can prevent a [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007–2011)|debt crisis]] and manage capital flight.
   - The inflationary impact of money printing must be carefully balanced.

## Economic Recovery and Stabilization

1. **Indicators of Economic Bottoming**
   - Import collapse improves the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] by about 8% of GDP.
   - Capital inflows stabilize,  and capital flight abates.
   - Countries often seek IMF or international support when reserves are low.

1. **Interest Rate Adjustments**
   - Short rates decrease after about a year,  while long rates remain elevated.
   - Short rates return to pre-crisis levels in around two years,  stimulating the economy.

1. **[[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] and [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|Inflation]] Dynamics**
   - As [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] fall,  the forward [[The Foreign Exchange Market Annotations|currency price]] rallies relative to the spot.
   - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] stabilization leads to reduced [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]],  reaching pre-crisis levels in about two years.

1. **[[The Balance of Payments|Balance of Payments]] Adjustment**
   - Decline in domestic conditions helps close the [[The Balance of Payments|balance of payments]] gap by reducing spending and imports.

## Conclusion

1. **Strategic [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Management**
   - Effective [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] management involves allowing depreciation to stimulate the economy while maintaining attractive [[Assets|returns]].
   - Policymakers must balance short-term stimulation with long-term stability to avoid inflationary spirals.

1. **Tailored Approaches**
   - While these are general trends,  specific strategies depend on each country's unique circumstances.

# Inflationary Depressions and Economic Adjustments

## Economic Contraction and Current Account Adjustments

1. **Import Contraction and Economic Collapse**
   - During a crisis,  the average country's imports contract by approximately 10%.
   - This contraction is a result of collapsing economic growth and a significant equity market decline,  often exceeding 50%.

1. **Current Account Surplus Emergence**
   - The collapse in imports typically shifts the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] from a deficit to a surplus.
	 - Surplus of 2% of GDP from a deficit of -6% of GDP.
	 - This shift occurs about 18 months into the crisis.

1. **Role of Exports in Economic Recovery**
   - In the early crisis stages,  exports play a minor role and may contract.
	 - Other countries may also experience economic slowdowns.
   - Exports tend to rebound in subsequent years,  aiding recovery.

## Managing Economic Adjustments: Well-Managed vs. Poorly Managed

### Well-Managed Adjustments

1. **[[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Management**
   - Policymakers bluff about not allowing significant [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] weakening.
   - When devaluation occurs,  it is a surprise and large enough to create a two-way market.
	 - This reduces [[FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE|expectations]] of further [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] weakening.

1. **Closing External Imbalances**
   - Tight [[Lecture 7-[[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds|Risk and Return]] of Bonds#7.6 [[A Preview of Alternative Formulations|Asset price]] reactions to [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] surprises|[[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]]]] aligns domestic demand with falling incomes.
   - Incentives are created for investors to remain in the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].
	 - Higher [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] compensate for [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]] risks.

1. **Smoothing the Downturn**
   - Reserves are used judiciously to manage foreign capital withdrawal.
   - Efforts are made to close external imbalances.

1. **Managing Bad Debts/Defaults**
   - Over-indebted entities work through debts,  with credit gaps filled elsewhere.

### Poorly Managed Adjustments

1. **[[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Management**
   - Policymakers are expected to allow [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises|currency weakness]],  increasing downward pressure.
   - Initial devaluation is small,  leading to further devaluations.
	 - This expectation causes higher [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] and [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]].

1. **Closing External Imbalances**
   - Loose [[Lecture 7-[[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds|Risk and Return]] of Bonds#7.6 [[A Preview of Alternative Formulations|Asset price]] reactions to [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] surprises|[[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]]]] favors domestic conditions,  delaying necessary adjustments.
   - Capital controls or restrictive measures are used to stop capital outflows.

1. **Smoothing the Downturn**
   - Reliance on reserve sales maintains higher spending levels.

1. **Managing Bad Debts/Defaults**
   - Disorderly defaults increase uncertainty and capital flight.

## Recovery and Economic Renewal

1. **Recovery Timeline**
   - Recovery typically takes a few years,  with initial reluctance from burned investors.
   - Domestic goods and labor become attractive due to [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]].
   - Higher exports and foreign direct [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] stimulate growth.

1. **Financial Institution Support**
   - Protecting and recapitalizing critical [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial institutions]] supports recovery.
   - Domestic financial pipelines are crucial for economic stabilization.

1. **Cycle Renewal**
   - The country enters a new virtuous cycle with productive [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] opportunities.
   - Capital inflows drive growth and asset prices,  attracting more capital.

1. **Economic Indicators of Recovery**
   - Incomes and spending pick up after one to two years.
   - Full activity recovery takes about three years from the bottom.
   - Real FX remains undervalued,  aiding export competitiveness.
   - Capital inflows and equity recovery occur over four to five years.

## The Spiral from Transitory Inflationary Depression to Hyperinflation

1. **Potential for Hyperinflation**
   - While many recoveries are engineered successfully,  some inflationary depressions spiral into hyperinflation.
   - This occurs when policy mismanagement exacerbates economic imbalances.

1. **Factors Leading to Hyperinflation**
   - Persistent negative [[Assets|returns]] and continuous [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] decline.
   - Inadequate policy responses to stabilize the economy and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].

By understanding these dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of inflationary depressions and economic adjustments,  ultimately leading to stabilization and recovery.

# Hyperinflations and Inflationary Spirals

## Introduction to Hyperinflations

1. **Definition and Characteristics**
   - Hyperinflations involve extreme [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] levels,  where prices of goods and services more than double annually.
   - They are coupled with severe economic hardship and significant losses of wealth.

1. **Prevalence and Importance**
   - Hyperinflations are more common than often perceived.
   - Understanding the transition from inflationary depressions to hyperinflations is crucial for economic policy and stability.

## Causes of Hyperinflations

1. **Policy Failures and Imbalances**
   - The primary cause is the failure of policymakers to address imbalances between external income,  spending,  and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]].
   - Persistent money printing to fund external spending exacerbates the situation.

1. **Involuntary and Voluntary Money Printing**
   - In some cases,  such as [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|Weimar Germany]],  external debt obligations (e.g.,  war reparations) necessitate money printing.
   - In other cases,  policymakers choose to print money to sustain growth rather than align spending with income.

1. **Consequences of Sustained Money Printing**
   - Prolonged and large-scale money printing can lead to hyperinflation.
   - Stopping money printing during a crisis can cause [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] shortages and economic contraction.

## Case Study: Weimar Germany

1. **External Debt Burden**
   - [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|Weimar Germany]] faced a crushing external [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] burden due to war reparations.
   - Defaulting on these obligations was largely not an option.

1. **Capital Outflows and [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|Inflation]]**
   - The required capital outflows were so significant that [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] problems were inevitable.
   - The case study of [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|Weimar Germany]] provides detailed insights into these dynamics.

1. **Shortage of Cash and [[The Economist Fewer Or Even None|Economic Impact]]**
   - Hyperinflation led to a cash shortage,  severely impacting commerce.
   - By late October 1923,  the entire 1913 money stock could barely purchase a loaf of bread.

## Dynamics of the Inflationary Spiral

1. **[[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Decline and [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|Inflation]] Psychology**
   - As the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines and money printing increases,  inflationary psychology sets in.
   - [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|Currency depreciation]] leads to capital flight,  creating a feedback loop of [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] and money printing.

1. **Diminishing Effectiveness of Money Printing**
   - Over time,  money printing becomes less effective in stimulating growth.
   - More printed money is diverted to real or foreign assets rather than productive investments.

1. **Shift in [[Runs On Money Market Mutual Funds|Investor Behavior]]**
   - Investors prefer real assets (e.g.,  gold) and foreign currencies to hedge against [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]].
   - Domestic [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] holders move away from investing in productive assets.

1. **Impact on Economic Growth**
   - The economy weakens as stocks suffer and no longer drive spending.
   - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] devaluation fails to stimulate growth,  exacerbating the economic downturn.

## Self-Reinforcing Inflation Dynamics

1. **Persistent [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|Inflation]] and [[Runs On Money Market Mutual Funds|Investor Behavior]]**
   - Continual [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines lead to persistent [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]],  reinforcing [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] psychology.
   - Investors' behavior shifts,  further fueling the [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] spiral.

1. **Wage-Cost Spiral**
   - [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|Inflation]] pressures spread to wages,  creating a wage-cost spiral.
   - Workers demand higher wages to maintain purchasing power,  further driving [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]].

## Conclusion

1. **Understanding Hyperinflations**
   - Hyperinflations result from complex interactions between policy failures,  [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] dynamics,  and [[Runs On Money Market Mutual Funds|investor behavior]].
   - Effective management requires addressing imbalances and avoiding excessive money printing.

1. **Lessons from Historical Cases**
   - Historical examples like [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|Weimar Germany]] provide valuable insights into the causes and dynamics of hyperinflations.
   - Policymakers must learn from these cases to prevent similar economic crises in the future.

# Inflationary Spirals and Economic Dynamics

## Wage-Price Spiral and Currency Depreciation

1. **Compelled Wage Increases and Price Adjustments**
   - Producers raise prices to offset increased wage costs.
   - Wage indexing contracts exacerbate this cycle by automatically adjusting wages with [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]].

1. **Vicious Cycle of [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|Inflation]] and [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|Currency Depreciation]]**
   - [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|Currency depreciation]] leads to rising internal prices.
   - Increased money supply further devalues the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  perpetuating the cycle.
   - Each [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] decline prompts behavioral changes in savers and investors.

1. **Behavioral Shifts in Savers and Investors**
   - Savers,  having experienced losses,  seek to protect purchasing power.
	 - They short cash and invest in foreign and physical assets.
   - [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|Inflation]] prompts bank depositors to demand quick access to funds.
	 - Deposits shift to short-term accounts,  reducing lending durations.

1. **Investor Concerns and Lending Practices**
   - Investors shorten lending durations or cease lending due to default risks.
   - Average debt maturities decrease during inflationary deleveragings.

## Financial System Illiquidity and Central Bank Responses

1. **Capital Withdrawal and Financial Illiquidity**
   - High [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] and money printing lower [[Real Interest Rates and Aggregate Production|real interest rates]],  making it cheap to short cash.
   - Capital withdrawal and rapid borrowing lead to [[Contemporary Financial Intermediation Notes|financial system]] illiquidity.
   - Banks struggle to meet cash demands,  and businesses face contract fulfillment issues.

1. **Central Bank Dilemma: Illiquidity vs. Money Printing**
   - Central banks choose between extreme illiquidity and accelerated money printing.
   - They opt to print money,  providing [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] to support banks and businesses.

1. **Consequences of [[Bank Runs Deposit Insurance and Liquidity|Liquidity Provision]]**
   - [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|Liquidity]] enables continued borrowing and [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] abroad,  fueling [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] and depreciation.
   - Investors seek [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] hedges like real assets or gold.

## Foreign Currency Debt and Rising Debt Burdens

1. **Impact of [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|Currency Depreciation]] on Foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Debt**
   - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] falls increase debt burdens,  necessitating spending cuts and asset sales.
   - Initial stimulation from [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]] fades,  exacerbating debt burdens.

1. **Foreign Investor Demands and [[Notes on Currency Swaps|Debt Service]]**
   - Higher debt burdens lead foreign investors to demand higher [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]].
   - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] declines and [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] increase [[Notes on Currency Swaps|debt service]] costs,  complicating economic stimulation.

## Government Responses and Capital Flight

1. **Tax Increases and Wealth Preservation**
   - Governments raise taxes on income and wealth to address rising debt burdens.
   - Wealthy individuals,  facing eroding net worths,  engage in tax evasion and capital flight.

1. **Credit Creation and Economic Growth**
   - Weakening growth and lack of foreign lending hinder credit creation.
   - Domestic borrowing does not spur growth,  as funds are spent on foreign assets.

1. **Local Spending and GDP Contribution**
   - Local spending often does not contribute to GDP.
   - Investments in gold,  factories,  or imports serve as wealth stores rather than productive assets.

## Feedback Mechanisms and Loss of Currency Faith

1. **Escalating [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|Inflation]] and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Declines**
   - Feedback mechanisms intensify [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] and [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] declines.
   - People lose faith in the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] as a store of value,  holding minimal reserves.

1. **Conclusion: Understanding Inflationary Spirals**
   - Inflationary spirals result from complex interactions between wage-[[Chapter 47 - Asset Price Dynamics|price dynamics]],  [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]],  and [[Runs On Money Market Mutual Funds|investor behavior]].
   - Effective management requires addressing these feedback loops to restore economic stability.

# Hyperinflation and Economic Breakdown

## Breakdown of Money as a Unit of Account

1. **Challenges with [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] as a Unit of Account**
   - Hyperinflation leads to excessively long lists of zeros in [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] values.
   - This makes the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] impractical for accounting purposes.

1. **[[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Instability and Medium of Exchange**
   - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] instability discourages producers from accepting domestic [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].
   - Producers often demand payment in foreign currencies or barter.

1. **Shortage of Foreign Exchange and Illiquidity**
   - Foreign exchange shortages exacerbate illiquidity.
   - Demand collapses as [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] loses its function as a medium of exchange.

1. **Limitations of Money Printing**
   - Money printing cannot alleviate this form of illiquidity.
   - Economic activity grinds to a halt,  leading to store closures and rising unemployment.

## Economic Contraction and Hyperinflation

1. **Rapid Economic Contraction**
   - Hyperinflation causes the economy to contract rapidly.
   - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] declines,  once beneficial,  now create chaos.

1. **Impact on Financial Wealth**
   - Hyperinflation erodes financial wealth as assets fail to keep pace with [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]].
   - Financial assets lose value relative to [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]].

1. **Extreme Wealth Redistributions**
   - Lenders' wealth is inflated away,  as are debtors' liabilities.
   - Wealth redistribution leads to economic and social upheaval.

## Political and Social Consequences

1. **Political Tensions and Clashes**
   - Economic contraction and wealth redistribution create political tensions.
   - Public servants,  like police officers,  may strike due to worthless wages.

1. **Disorder and Violence**
   - Disorder,  crime,  looting,  and violence peak during hyperinflation.
   - In [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|Weimar Germany]],  the government declared a "state of siege" to restore order.

## Investment Strategies During Hyperinflation

1. **Basic [[China Investment Corporation (CIC)|Investment Principles]]**
   - Short the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] and move money out of the country.
   - Invest in [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|commodities]] and commodity industries (e.g.,  gold,  coal,  metals).

1. **Equities and Bonds**
   - Investing in equities becomes risky as [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] transitions to hyperinflation.
   - Share prices and exchange rates diverge,  making equities a poor [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]].
   - Bonds are wiped out due to [[Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises 1|currency depreciation]].

1. **Preferred Assets**
   - Gold becomes the preferred asset to hold during hyperinflation.
   - Shares,  despite rising in local [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  are disastrous investments.

## Resolution of Hyperinflation

1. **[[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]]'s Loss of Status**
   - Once hyperinflation occurs,  the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] loses its status as a store of wealth.
   - Recovery requires creating a new [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] with strong backing.

1. **Classic Path to Ending Hyperinflation**
   - Countries typically phase out the old [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] and introduce a new one.
   - The new [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] must have very hard backing to restore confidence.

By understanding these dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of hyperinflation and its impact on the economy and society.
