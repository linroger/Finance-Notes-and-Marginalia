Chapter 4: The Last 500 Years Part 1: The Big Cycles of the Dutch and British Empires and Their Currencies

## **Chapter 4: The Last 500 Years Part 1: The Big Cycles of the Dutch and British Empires and Their Currencies**

In Chapter 1 ("The Big Picture in a Tiny Nutshell"), I looked at the archetypical rises and declines of empires and their reserve currencies and the various types of powers that they gained and lost, and in Chapter 2 ("The Big Cycle of Money, Credit, Debt, and Economic Activity") and its appendix ("The Changing Value of Money") I reviewed the big money, credit, and debt cycles. In this chapter, I will review **the rises and declines of the Dutch, British, and American empires and their reserve currencies and will touch on the rise of the Chinese empire.** 

**While the evolution of empires and currencies is one continuous story that started before there was recorded history, in this chapter I am going to pick up the story around the year 1600. My objective is simply to put where we are in perspective of history and bring us up to date.** I will begin by very briefly reviewing what the Big Cycle looks like and then scan through the last 500 years to show these Big Cycles playing out before examining more closely the declines of the Dutch and British empires and their reserve currencies. Then I will show how the decline of the British empire and the pound **evolved into the rise of the US empire and US dollar and I will take a glimpse at the emergence of the Chinese empire and the Chinese renminbi.**

**That will bring us up to the present and prepare us to try to think about what will come next.** 

## **The Big Cycle of the Life of an Empire**

**Just as there is a human life cycle that typically lasts about 80 years (give or take) and no two are exactly the same but most are similar, there is an analogous empire life cycle that has its own typical patterns.** For example, for most of us, during the first phase of life we are under our parents' guidance and learn in school until we are about 18
