Chapter 2: The Big Cycle of Money, Credit, Debt, and Economic Activity

# **Chapter 2: The Big Cycle of Money, Credit, Debt, and Economic Activity**

Because **what most people and their countries want the most is wealth and power, and because money and credit are the biggest single influence on how wealth and power rise and decline, if you don't understand how money and credit work, you can't understand the biggest driver of politics within and between countries so you can't understand how the world order works. And if you don't understand how the world order works, you can't understand what's coming at you.** 

For example, if you don't understand how the Roaring '20s led to a debt bubble and a big wealth gap, and how the bursting of that debt bubble led to the 1930-33 depression, and how the depression and wealth gap led to conflicts over wealth all around the world, you can't understand the forces that led to Franklin D. Roosevelt being elected president. You also wouldn't understand why, soon after his inauguration in 1933, he announced a new plan in which the central government and the Federal Reserve would together provide a lot of money and credit, a change that was similar to things happening in other countries at the same time and similar to what is happening now. Without understanding money and credit, you wouldn't understand why these things changed the world order nor would you understand what happened next (i.e., the war, how it was won and lost, and why the new world order was created as it was in 1945), and you won't be able to understand what is happening now or imagine the future. However, by seeing many of these cases and understanding the mechanics behind them, you will be able to better

understand what is happening now and what is likely to happen in the future.

In doing this study, I spoke with several of the world's most renowned historians and political practitioners, including current and former heads of state, foreign ministers, finance ministers, and central bankers. In our exploratio
