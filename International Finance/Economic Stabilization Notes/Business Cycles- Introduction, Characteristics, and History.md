# Business Cycles: Introduction, Characteristics, and History

## Introduction

Although the U.S. economy has exhibited growth in real GDP of about 3% per year
on average over the 75 years since World War II, fluctuations in economic
activity around the trend are common. Indeed, fluctuations continuously occur not
only for entire economies but for individuals and industries as well.

For example, in the case of individuals, economic activity fluctuates between
night and day and between periods of employment and non-employment.

In the case of industries, economic activity fluctuates (i) with the seasons: for
example, construction activity slows during winter months and the education
industry scales way back during the summer months (ii) with shifts in underlying
industry supply and demand factors: for example, increased oil prices raise an
input price of certain manufacturers leading to production cutbacks; fear of
getting seriously ill by going out to stores during the early stages of the COVID
pandemic greatly reduced demand for products sold at retailers.

In the case of the entire economy, there are recessions and expansions—i.e.,
business cycles. These are associated with fluctuations in aggregate output,
income, and employment and even can influence political election outcomes. We
will focus primarily on macroeconomic fluctuations in this course.

But do people care about fluctuations in economic activity and in well-being or
utility? People buy private health, auto, and home insurance and thus reveal that
they do not like negative fluctuations (such as bad health, auto accidents, and
house fires) in their wellbeing. They also do not like fluctuations both in the
downward and upward directions. Indeed, people pay to get advice and training to
prevent their weight from increasing or decreasing by much. Also, people pay to
avoid the impact on well-being of large swings in temperature by installing
heating/cooling systems in their houses or by buying different wardrobes for
summer and winter. This leads to the question—examined in module 3—of how much
people would pay to avoid the effects of business cycle fluctuations in income,
employment, and consumption (and hence, utility). If they would pay a lot, and
given that private insurance against macroeconomic fluctuations generally is
unavailable, then there may well be a role for macroeconomic fiscal and monetary
policies to help stabilize the economy. One would hope that there is strong
justification given an abundance of empirical evidence that U.S. monetary and
fiscal policies each in fact respond vigorously to macroeconomic fluctuations.

## Business Cycle Characteristics

In 1959, Arthur Burns—former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and a towering
figure in the analysis of business cycles—predicted, if not the end of business
cycles in the United States, at least that "the business cycle is unlikely to be
as disturbing or troublesome to our children as it once was to our fathers." How
has his prediction turned out? And for that matter, what exactly is a business
cycle? We examine these issues.

**Definition:**

Business cycles are a type of fluctuation found in the aggregate economic
activity of nations. A cycle consists of expansions occurring at about the same
time in many economic activities, followed by similarly general recessions,
contractions, and revivals which merge into the expansion phase of the next
cycle; this sequence of changes is recurrent but not periodic; in duration
business cycles vary from more than 1 year to ten or twelve years. (Arthur Burns
and Wesley Mitchell, Measuring Business Cycles, 1946)

**Aggregate economic activity.** Cycles are defined broadly as fluctuations in
"aggregate economic activity" rather than as fluctuations in a single variable,
although the single variable, real GDP, usually is the main focus of attention.

**Expansions and contractions.** Start by thinking of a business cycle as a sine
wave with an upward slope reflecting underlying growth in the economy (we will
relax the idea of the cycle being a sine wave—i.e., being periodic—shortly). The
period of time during which aggregate economic activity is falling significantly
across a broad segment of the economy is a contraction or recession.

After reaching the low point of the contraction, the trough (T), activity begins
to increase. The period of time during which activity grows is an expansion or a
boom. After reaching the high point of the expansion, the peak (P), activity
begins to decline. The entire sequence measured from peak to peak or from trough
to trough is a business cycle. This suggests that cycles are temporary deviations
from the economy's normal growth path.

Peaks and troughs are known as turning points. There is no simple formula that
tells us when a peak or trough has been reached. A conventional definition found
in the press that a recession has occurred when there are two consecutive
quarters of negative real GDP growth is not widely accepted by economists because
real GDP is only one of many possible indicators of aggregate activity. The NBER
Business Cycle Dating Committee retrospectively determines the "official" dating
of peaks and troughs. They consider both the depth of the decline in economic
activity as well as its duration. Real GDP (and the corresponding income side
measure, Gross Domestic Income) is the most important piece of data but the NBER
also makes use of data on real personal income (less transfers), payroll and
household measures of employment, aggregate hours of work, industrial production,
and real manufacturing wholesale and retail sales.

The recession resulting from the financial crisis in 2008 illustrates the
difficulty of choosing business-cycle turning points. The various key data series
all reached peaks at some time between late 2007 and mid-2008. For example, GDP
rose in 2007:Q4, fell in 2008:Q1, rose in 2008:Q2 and then declined for the next
four quarters; so when did the recession begin? (The situation is complicated by
the fact that GDP data are revised frequently; indeed, GDP declined in 2007:Q4
using preliminary estimates.)

The NBER eventually decided that the recession began in December 2007, chiefly on
the grounds that employment and industrial production began to decline around
that time. The recession lasted until June 2009.

## Comovement

An important feature of business cycles is that many economic variables tend to
move together, although not all variables display the same degree of sensitivity.
Different categorizations of economic variables:

- **Procyclical**: Positively correlated with the cycle—high in booms, low in
  recessions.
- **Countercyclical**: Negatively correlated with the cycle—low in booms, high
  in recessions.
- **Acyclical**: Not systematically related to the cycle.

We also describe the timing of a variable's turning points relative to the
turning points of the business cycle:

- **Leading**: The variable tends to move ahead of aggregate economic
  activity—it is helpful in forecasting.
- **Lagging**: The variable tends to follow aggregate economic activity.
- **Coincident**: The variable tends to move at the same time as aggregate
  economic activity.

For example, the Conference Board compiles a Composite Index of 10 Leading
Economic Indicators that is highly procyclical and has turning points that tend
to precede business-cycle turning points. The 10 indicators (some after
adjustments) in this measure are:

1. Average weekly hours (manufacturing)
2. Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance
3. Manufacturers' new orders, consumer goods and materials
4. ISM new order index
5. Manufacturers' new orders, non-defense capital goods ex aircraft orders
6. Building permits, new private housing units
7. Stock prices, 500 common stocks
8. Leading Credit index
9. Interest rate spread, 10-year Treasury bonds less federal funds
10. Average consumer expectations for economic conditions

Stock prices turn out to be one of the most sensitive indexes for forecasting
business cycle turning points. But as Nobel Prize winner Paul Samuelson once
observed, "Wall street indexes predicted nine of the last five recessions."

## Persistence and Time Varying Volatility

Another significant feature of business cycles is that they show a certain degree
of persistence:

- If the economy is in a recession this quarter, it tends to remain in a
  recession the following quarter.
- If the economy is in an expansion this quarter, it tends to remain in an
  expansion the following quarter.

Persistence explains why economists and the media place such heavy emphasis on
changes in the growth rate of real GDP. When output growth slows, it may be a
signal of more weakness to come; when growth speeds up, it may signal a boom.

Business-cycle volatility appears to have fallen considerably over the past
century. Real GDP was a lot more volatile a hundred years ago than it is today.
Economic volatility dropped even further in the mid-1980s, which led observers to
declare the arrival of the "Great Moderation." That term appeared to be ironic
after the recent Great Recession, but volatility since the recession has returned
to low values.

Whether or not the economy was really all that more stable in the eighties and
the nineties has important policy implications. If policy makers have finally
gotten a handle on the causes of severe recessions, then it is less likely that
we will suffer through another depression or a decade of stagflation. But if the
Great Moderation was an accident having little to do with good planning and wise
policy, then crises may recur with little warning.

Several explanations have been offered for why volatility may have fallen:

1. **Good luck**: If supply shocks have been milder than in the past.
2. **Improved macroeconomic policy and use of automatic stabilizers**
3. **Structural changes** associated with better inventory management or the
   shift from manufacturing to services.

## International Business Cycles

Business cycles are remarkably similar across countries, especially for countries
with strong economic or financial links, with output and inflation generally
moving in the same direction. On the other hand, there are also a fair amount of
idiosyncratic or country-specific shocks. The increased amount of international
mobility of goods and financial assets is thought to have increased the
synchronization of business cycles across economies. The COVID pandemic in 2020 is
a vivid example of a synchronized global recession.

## Business Cycle History

To give you a sense of what recessions are like, it may be helpful to briefly
consider postwar business-cycle history. What were the causes? How did policy
makers respond? What brought each recession to a halt?
