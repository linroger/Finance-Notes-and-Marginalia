# Foreign Exchange Reserves
## What Are Foreign Exchange Reserves?

[Foreign exchange reserves](Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia.md) are assets that are denominated in a foreign [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) held by a central bank. These reserves are used to back liabilities and influence [Risk and Return](Lecture%207-[[Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds) of Bonds#7.6 [Asset price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) reactions to [monetary policy](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) surprises|[monetary policy](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md)]].

[Foreign exchange reserves](Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia.md) can include [banknotes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/banknote.asp),  deposits,  bonds,  [treasury bills](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp),  and other government securities. These assets serve many purposes but are most significantly held to ensure that a central government agency has backup funds if their national [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) rapidly devalues or becomes entirely insolvent.

## How Foreign Exchange Reserves Work

It is a common practice in countries around the world for a central bank to hold a significant amount of reserves in its [foreign exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forex.asp). Most of these reserves are held in the U.S. dollar since it is the most traded [currency]([Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md).asp) in the world. It is not uncommon for the [foreign exchange reserves](Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia.md) to be made up of the British pound (GBP),  the euro (EUR),  the Chinese yuan (CNY) or the Japanese yen (JPY) as well0.\1

Economists assert that it is prudent to hold [foreign exchange reserves](Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia.md) in a [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) that is not directly linked to a country’s own [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  in order to provide a barrier should there be a market shock0.\1 However,  this practice has become more difficult as currencies have become increasingly intertwined as global trading has become easier.

[Foreign exchange reserves](Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia.md) are not only used to back liabilities but also influence [Risk and Return](Lecture%207-[[Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds) of Bonds#7.6 [Asset price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) reactions to [monetary policy](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) surprises|[monetary policy](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md)]]﻿.

## Example of Foreign Exchange Reserves

The world's largest current foreign exchange reserve holder is China,  a country holding more than $3 trillion of its assets in a foreign currency0.\1 Most of its reserves are held in the U.S. dollar. Such an arrangement makes [international trade](../../Globalization/Chapter%202-The%20Principle%20Of%20Comparative%20Advantage.md) easier to execute since most of the trading takes place using the U.S. dollar0.\1

Saudi Arabia also holds considerable [foreign exchange reserves](Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia.md),  as the country relies mainly on the export of its vast oil reserves. If oil prices begin to rapidly drop,  the country's economy could suffer. It keeps large amounts of foreign funds in reserves to act as a cushion should this happen0.\1

U.S. [foreign exchange reserves](Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia.md) totaled over $244 billion as of the last week of July 2024.5

Russia’s [foreign exchange reserves](Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia.md) are held mostly in U.S. dollars,  much like the rest of the world,  but the country also keeps some of its reserves in gold. Since gold is a commodity with an underlying value,  the risk in relying on gold in the event of a Russian economic decline is that the value of gold will not be significant enough to support the country’s needs. As of February 2022,  Russia's [foreign exchange reserves](Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia.md) totaled some $630 billion0.\1 However,  sanctions imposed by the European Union (EU),  the U.S.,  and other nations in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 rendered most of those reserves inaccessible to the central bank0.\1

Another danger of using gold as a reserve is that the asset is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it. During an economic crash,  that would put the power of determining the value of the [gold](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/08/invest-in-gold.asp) reserve,  and therefore Russia’s financial fallback,  into the hands of the entity willing to purchase it.

## How Much in U.S. Treasuries Does China Hold?

As of May 2024,  China held $768.3 billion in U.S. [Treasury securities](../../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Front%20Matter/US%20Markets.md),  making it the second-largest foreign holder of U.S. debt after Japan0.\1

## Who Has the Largest Foreign Exchange Reserves in the World?

According to an [analysis of [foreign exchange reserves](Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia.md)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/033115/10-countries-biggest-forex-reserves.asp),  China has the largest foreign exchange reserve in the world,  holding over $3.6 trillion. Japan came in second,         holding $1.3 trillion,  and Switzerland followed with $890 billion.

## How Much Money Total Is Held in Foreign Exchange Reserve?

According to the latest available data,  the total value of all [foreign exchange reserves](Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia.md) equaled nearly $12.35 trillion dollars in the first quarter of 2024.9 That number represents a slight increase from the same period in 2023.

## The Bottom Line

[Foreign exchange reserves](Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia.md) are foreign-denominated assets held by a central bank for the purpose of [backing liabilities](.md) and influencing [Risk and Return](Lecture%207-[[Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds) of Bonds#7.6 [Asset price](../../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) reactions to [monetary policy](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) surprises|[monetary policy](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md)]].

[Foreign exchange reserves](Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia.md) can take many forms,  including cash and bonds. They can provide a buffer in times of crisis,  should a country's own [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) lose value.

China currently holds the world's biggest foreign exchange reserve.
