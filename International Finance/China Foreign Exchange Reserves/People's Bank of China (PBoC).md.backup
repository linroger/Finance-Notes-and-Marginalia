## History of the PBoC

The PBoC was established on Dec. 1,     1948,     and is responsible for [Risk and Return]([Lecture%207-[[Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds) of Bonds#7.6 [Asset price](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) reactions to [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) surprises|[monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md)]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp) and fiscal regulation in Mainland China. The PBoC is one of the largest central banks in the world,  with over $3 trillion in [foreign exchange reserves]([Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange-reserves.asp). The Huabei Bank,  the Beihai Bank,  and the Xibei Farmer Bank were consolidated to form the PBoC after the Chinese Communist Party's victory and the creation of the People's Republic of China0.\1

In September 1983,  the State Council decided that the PBoC should become the central bank. The bank's first headquarters were in Shijiazhuang,     Hebei,     and were later moved to Beijing in 1949. Between 1950 and 1978,  the PBoC was the only bank in the nation and oversaw both central [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) and commercial [banking](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) operations. All other banks within mainland China,  such as the Bank of China,     were either divisions of the PBoC or did not accept deposits0.\1

## Responsibilities of the PBoC

The PBoC is responsible for drafting laws and regulations for its financial functions,  including implementing [Risk and Return](Lecture%207-[[Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds) of Bonds#7.6 [Asset price](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) reactions to [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) surprises|[monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md)]] to maintain [financial stability](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md) and economic growth in China. Additional responsibilities involve setting [interest rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md),  regulating [financial markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md),  issuing the Renminbi [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) for circulation,  regulating interbank lending and the interbank [bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp) market,  managing [Financial Instruments]([[A%20Practical%20Guide%20for%20Actuaries%20and%20other%20Business%20Professionals.)/Lecture Notes/Teaching Note 1- Forward Rates Agreement/Foreign Exchange Quoting Conventions.md|foreign exchange]],  and recording foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) transactions0.\1

Public companies in China are funded by the PBoC. Funding for companies was previously provided through [grant](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grant.asp) transfers by the state. The State-Owned Bank,  under the direct supervision of the PBoC,  manages grant transfer operations. The bank is run by a board of directors. The PBoC is run by Governor Yi Gang,  five deputy governors,  and a chief inspector0.\1

The PBoC has several regional branches,  some of which are located in Tianjin,  Shenyang,  Shanghai,  Nanjing,  Jinan,  Wuhan,  Guangzhou,  Chengdu,  and Xi'an. In addition,  there are operations offices in Beijing and Chongqing and many municipal sub-branches throughout the country0.\1

## PBoC Financial Position

As part of its annual financial statement reporting,  Yuan Changneng,  Deputy Governor of the [People's Bank of China]([[People's%20Bank%20of%20China%20(PBoC)) (PBoC)|[People's Bank of China](.md)]],  delivered an address highlighting the PBOC's actions and achievements in 2022 and its plans for 2023. He emphasized the PBOC's commitment to implementing decisions and policies of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council under the strong leadership of Comrade Xi Jinping.

One of the major points from his presentation was the PBOC lowered the required reserve ratio twice in 2022,  injecting over one trillion RMB into the real economy. The central bank also provided [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) through various channels,  creating a favorable environment for macroeconomic stability. Key indicators like the broad money supply (M2) and RMB loans demonstrated stable and accelerated growth0.\1

In 2022,  the PBOC introduced targeted [Risk and Return](Lecture%207-[[Lecture%207-Risk%20and%20Return%20of%20Bonds) of Bonds#7.6 [Asset price](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) reactions to [monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) surprises|[monetary policy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md)]] instruments to support distressed groups and key areas in the real economy. It prioritized lending to the manufacturing industry,  technology-based SMEs,  innovative companies,  and micro and small businesses. This support helped stabilize the national economy,  with notable growth in these areas0.\1

Last,  despite interest rate hikes in major European and American economies,  the PBOC continued its reform of the loan prime rate,  lowering it in 2022. This contributed to a decrease in the overall [financing cost](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) for the real economy. The weighted average interest rate on newly issued corporate loans dropped,  and a market-oriented mechanism for deposit rates was established to stabilize bank liability costs0.\1
