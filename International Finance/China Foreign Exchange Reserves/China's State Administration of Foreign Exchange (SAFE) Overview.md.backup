## Understanding China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange

China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange was created in 1979 in the nation's capital,  Beijing,  where it is headquartered0.\1﻿ The agency operated independently until 1998,  when the Chinese government brought it under the control of the [People's Bank of China]([[[People's%20Bank%20of%20China%20(PBoC)) (PBoC)|[People's Bank of China](People's%20Bank%20of%20China%20(PBoC).md)]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peoples-bank-china-pboc.asp) (PBOC). The government's move was to boost the image and influence of the PBOC as a central bank0.\1﻿

SAFE has a series of administrative offices or [branches](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/branch-office.asp),  central sub-branches,  and sub-branches set up in different provinces and cities across China,  which report directly to the federal government. There are a total of 36 branches,  309 central sub-branches,  and 517 sub-branches in the agency's network0.\1﻿

The agency is administered at the state level and is made up of seven departments,  which oversee its primary functions0.\1﻿ These main responsibilities include:

- Drafting policies and [regulations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulation-i.asp) related to foreign reserves and foreign exchanges
- Supervising and inspecting [forex](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forex.asp) transactions
- Managing China's forex,    gold reserves,  and foreign [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) [assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp)6﻿﻿7

SAFE is also involved in the study and implementation of policy measures for the advancement of the convertibility of the country's official national [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  the [renminbi](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/c/cny-china-yuan-renminbi.asp) (CNY/RMB)0.\1﻿ The significance of an adjustment in the [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)'s value to the [global economy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Fewer%20Or%20Even%20None.md),  along with China's huge [forex reserves](Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia/Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves.md),  makes the agency an increasingly important player in international forex and [financial markets]([Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-market.asp).

The terms renminbi and yuan are often used interchangeably to describe China's [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)—where renminbi refers to the actual name of the [currency](../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) and yuan is the unit of account for the country's [financial system](../../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md).
