# The Balance of Payments

# CHAPTER 2 NOTES: THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

[BALANCE OF PAYMENTS](CHAPTER%202%20THE%20[[The%20Balance%20of%20Payments) Annotations]]

## WHAT IS THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS?

The [balance of payments](.md) is a statistical record of all the [economic transactions](.md) between residents of the reporting country and residents of the rest of the world during a given time period.

### RESIDENTS AND NON-RESIDENTS

A resident comprises individuals,  households,  firms,  and the public authorities.

There are some issues defining residents:

- Multinational corporations are by definition resident in more than one country. For [balance of payments](.md) reporting,  the subsidiaries of a multinational are treated as being a resident in the country in which they are located,  even if their shares are not actually owned by domestic residents.
- International organizations such as the IMF,  World Bank,  United Nations,  European Commission,  etc.,  are treated as being foreign residents even though they may be located in the reporting country. For example,  the IMF is treated as a foreign resident even though it is located in Washington DC.

The criterion for a transaction to be included in the [balance of payments](.md) is that it must involve a transaction between a resident of the reporting country and a resident of the rest of the world. Purchases and sales between residents of the same country are excluded.

## COLLECTION,  REPORTING,  AND PRESENTATION OF STATISTICS

The [balance of payments](.md) statistics record all transactions between domestic and foreign residents,  including:

- Purchases or sales of goods
- Services
- Financial assets such as bonds,  equities,  and [banking](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) transactions

## BALANCE OF PAYMENTS ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTS

- Each receipt of [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) from non-residents is recorded as a **credit**.
- Each payment to non-residents is recorded as a **debit**.

The three main accounts are:

- **Current account**: Records income flows.
- **[Capital and financial account](.md)**: Records changes in assets and liabilities of the private sector and non-central bank public sector.
- **Settlements account**: Records changes in central bank assets and liabilities.

### THE TRADE BALANCE

Trade Balance = Exports of goods - Imports of goods

### THE CURRENT ACCOUNT

Current Account = Trade Balance + Exports of services + Interest,  dividends received + Unilateral receipts - Imports of services - Interest,  dividends paid - Unilateral payments

### THE BASIC BALANCE

Basic Balance = Current Account Balance + Balance on long-term [capital and financial account](.md)

### THE OFFICIAL SETTLEMENTS BALANCE

Settlements Balance = Current Account Balance + Balance on [capital and financial account](.md) + Statistical error (Recorded with the opposite sign to the sum of the above)

## OVERVIEW OF THE SUB-ACCOUNTS

**The trade balance** is also called the visible balance,  as it represents exports/imports of physically visible goods.

**The [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) balance** brings together the trade balance and invisible balance,  covering services trade,  [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) income flows,  and unilateral transfers.

**The [capital and financial account](.md)** records financial and capital transactions into/out of the country,  distinguishing between private/public sector and short/long-term flows.

**The settlements account** shows any transactions by the central bank,  including changes in [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) reserves and IMF borrowing/lending.

## RECORDING TRANSACTIONS IN THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

There are 5 types of cross-border transactions:

1. Exchange of goods/services for financial assets
1. Exchange of goods/services for other goods/services (barter)
1. Exchange of financial items for other financial items
1. Transfer of goods/services without quid pro quo (e.g. aid)
1. Transfer of financial assets without quid pro quo (e.g. remittances)

## INTERPRETING KEY BALANCES

**The [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md)** is very important - a surplus means the country earns more than it spends.

**The basic balance** was important under fixed exchange rates for bringing together stable elements. But deficits/surpluses can be benign or problematic depending on the circumstances.

**The settlements account** shows pressure on the monetary authorities under fixed exchange rates. It is less relevant under floating rates.

## THE NET INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION AND BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

The **net international [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) position (NIIP)** is the difference between a country’s external financial assets and liabilities.

Current account deficits typically worsen the NIIP by increasing liabilities to or reducing assets versus foreigners. Surpluses improve the NIIP by increasing assets or reducing liabilities.

But the NIIP is also affected by:

- Valuation changes in external assets/liabilities (e.g. changes in stock/bond prices)
- Exchange rate fluctuations

So a country’s NIIP depends on flows ([current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md)) and stocks (valuation/exchange [rate changes](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md)).

## SOME OPEN ECONOMY IDENTITIES

A key macroeconomic identity is:
$$**(X - M) = (S - I) + (T - G)**$$

The [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) balance equals private sector savings minus [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) plus the government budget balance.

This implies a [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) deficit must be financed by private sector dissaving and/or a government budget deficit.

There is a counterpart flow in the financial account to finance the [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) imbalance.

## OPEN ECONOMY MULTIPLIERS

In an open economy,  GDP differs from a closed economy because:

- Exports (X) are an additional injection
- Imports (M) are an additional leakage

Open economy multipliers show the magnified impact of an initial change in exports or government spending on eventual GDP based on induced consumption effects.

## The IMF and Credit Facilities

The IMF aims to promote international monetary cooperation and trade growth. A key function was to support the fixed exchange rate system by providing short-term credit to countries facing temporary [balance of payments](.md) problems. This avoided the need for them to deflate their economies just to maintain their peg.

When the IMF was created,  each member was allocated a **quota** related to its economic importance. Part of the quota was placed in reserve assets (gold) and part in the member’s own [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) with the Fund. This provided a pool of resources that could be lent out.

Countries facing payment difficulties could draw on their quota,  up to 125% in total via automatic and conditional credit tranches. The conditions aimed to improve the [balance of payments](.md). Repayment was required over 3-5 years.

This facility helped countries experiencing transitory external shocks to maintain employment and trade without resorting to devaluation.

## CHAPTER 2: THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

Deficits may lead the government to raise [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) or reduce public expenditure in order to reduce expenditure on imports. Indeed,  for a country with a fixed exchange rate and persistent deficits,  there could be a speculative attack on the country,  forcing it to devalue its [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). Alternatively,  deficits may lead to calls for protection against foreign imports or capital controls to defend the exchange rate. 

### 2.2: WHAT IS THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS?

The [balance of payments](.md) is a statistical record of all the [economic transactions](.md) between residents of the reporting country and residents of the rest of the world during a given time period.

A key definition that needs to be resolved at the outset is that of a domestic and foreign resident.

The term ‘residents’ comprises individuals,  households,  firms,  and the public authorities. There are some problems that arise with respect to the definition of a resident; for example,  multinational corporations are by definition resident in more than one country. For the purposes of [balance of payments](.md) reporting,  the subsidiaries of a multinational are treated as being a resident in the country in which they are located,  even if their shares are not actually owned by domestic residents. Another problem concerns the treatment of international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF),  the World Bank,  the United Nations,  the European Commission,  and so forth. These institutions are treated as being foreign residents even though they may actually be located in the reporting country. For example,  although the IMF is located in Washington,  contributions by the US government to the Fund are included in the US [balance of payments](.md) statistics because they are regarded as transactions with a foreign resident. Tourists are regarded as being foreign residents if they stay in the reporting country for less than a year. The criterion for a transaction to be included in the [balance of payments](.md) is that it must involve a transaction between a resident of the reporting country and a resident of the rest of the world. Purchases and sales between residents of the same country are excluded.

### 2.3 COLLECTION,  REPORTING,  AND PRESENTATION OF THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS STATISTICS

The [balance of payments](.md) statistics record all of the transactions between domestic and foreign residents,  be they purchases or sales of goods,  services,  or financial assets such as bonds,  equities,  and [banking](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) transactions. 

### 2.4 BALANCE OF PAYMENTS ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTS

Each receipt of [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) from residents of the rest of the world is recorded as a credit item (a plus in the accounts),  while each payment to residents of the rest of the world is recorded as a debit (a minus in the accounts).

The [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) items refer to income flows,  the [capital and financial account](.md) records changes in the assets and liabilities of the private sector and non-central-bank public sector,  and the settlements account records any changes in assets and liabilities of the central bank.

### 2.5 AN OVERVIEW OF THE SUB-ACCOUNTS IN THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

The trade balance

The trade balance is sometimes referred to as the visible balance because it represents the difference between receipts for exports of goods and expenditure on imports of goods,  which can be visibly seen crossing frontiers. The receipts for exports are recorded as a credit in the [balance of payments](.md),  while the payment for imports is recorded as a debit. When the trade balance is in surplus,  this means that the country has earned more from its exports of goods than it has paid for its imports of goods. The [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) balance is the sum of the visible trade balance and the invisible balance. The invisible balance shows the difference between revenue received for exports of services and payments made for imports of services,  such as shipping,  tourism,  insurance,  and [banking](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md). In addition,  receipts and payments of interest,  dividends,  and profits are recorded in the invisible balance because they represent the rewards for [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in overseas companies,  bonds,  and equity,  while payments reflect the rewards to foreign residents for their [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in the domestic economy. As such,  they are receipts and payments for the services of capital that earn and cost the country income,  just as do exports and imports. There is an item referred to as 'unilateral transfers' included in the invisible balance; these are payments or receipts for which there is no corresponding quid pro quo. Examples of such transactions are migrant workers' remittances to their families back home,  the payment of pensions to foreign residents,  and foreign aid. Such receipts and payments represent a redistribution of income between domestic and foreign residents. Unilateral payments can be viewed as a fall in domestic income due to payments to foreigners and so are recorded as a debit,  while unilateral receipts can be viewed as an increase in income due to receipts from foreigners and consequently are recorded as a credit.

The [capital and financial account](.md)

The [capital and financial account](.md) records transactions concerning the movement of capital into and out of the country. Capital comes into the country by borrowing,  sales of overseas assets,  and [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in the country by foreigners. These items are referred to as 'capital inflows' and are recorded as credit items in the [balance of payments](.md). Capital inflows are,  in effect,  a decrease in the country's holding of foreign assets or an increase in liabilities to foreigners. Capital inflows are recorded as pluses,  and the easiest way to understand why they are pluses is to think of foreign borrowing as the export of an IOU. Similarly,  [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) by foreign residents in the domestic economy can be thought of as the export of equity or bonds,  while sales of overseas investments to foreigners is an export of those investments to foreigners. Conversely,  capital leaves the country due to lending,  buying of overseas assets,  and purchases of domestic assets owned by foreign residents. These items represent capital outflows and are recorded as debits in the capital account. Capital outflows are,  in effect,  an increase in the country's holding of foreign assets or a decrease in liabilities to foreigners. These items are recorded as debits as they represent the purchase of an IOU from foreigners,  the purchase of foreign bonds or equity,  and the purchase of investments in the foreign economy. Items in the [capital and financial account](.md) are normally distinguished according to whether they originate from the private or public sector and whether they are of a short-term or long-term nature. The summation of the capital inflows and outflows as recorded in the financial account gives the financial account balance.

Settlements balance

The settlements balance shows transactions (if any occur) undertaken by the central bank. There are two key items that are recorded in the settlements account: (i) rises and falls in [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) reserves; (ii) borrowing funds or repayments of loans to international organizations such as the IMF. A central bank normally holds a stock of reserves made up of [foreign currency assets](China%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves/Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves%20-%20Wikipedia/Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves.md),  principally US Treasury bonds (the US authorities hold mainly euro and yen Treasury bonds). Such reserves are held primarily to enable the central bank to purchase its [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) should it wish to prevent it from depreciating. If a central bank intervenes in the [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) market to purchase its [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  then its [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) reserves fall,  and this is recorded as a plus in the settlements account. Conversely,  if a central bank intervenes in the [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) market to sell its [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  then its [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) reserves rise,  and this is recorded as a minus in the settlements account.

Reserves increase when the authorities have been purchasing the foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) because the domestic [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) is strong. This implies that the other items in the [balance of payments](.md) are in surplus,  so reserve increases have to be recorded as a debit to ensure overall balance. Conversely,  reserves fall when the authorities have been supporting a [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) that is weak,  that is,  all other items sum to a deficit,  so reserve falls must be recorded as a plus to ensure overall balance. 

If a country has to borrow funds from the IMF,  then this is an increase in its liabilities and is recorded as a plus in the settlements account. Conversely,  when a country pays back the loan to the IMF,  then this is a reduction in its liabilities and is recorded as a minus in its settlements account.

### 2.6 RECORDING OF TRANSACTIONS IN THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

There are basically five types of [economic transactions](.md) that can take place between domestic and foreign residents:

1. An exchange of goods/services in return for a financial asset.
1. An exchange of goods/services in return for other goods/services. Such trade is known as barter or countertrade.
1. An exchange of a financial item in return for a financial item.
1. A transfer of goods or services with no corresponding quid pro quo (for example,  military and food aid).
1. A transfer of financial assets with no corresponding quid pro quo (for example,  migrant workers' remittances to their families abroad or a money gift). 

The trade account and [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md)

Since the [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) balance is concerned with both visible and invisible items,  it is generally considered to be the more important of the two accounts. What really makes a [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) surplus or deficit important is that a surplus means that the country as a whole is earning more than it is spending and,  as such,  is increasing its stock of claims on the rest of the world or is reducing its indebtedness; while a deficit means that the country as a whole is spending more than it is earning and is therefore reducing its net claims on the rest of the world or is increasing its indebtedness.

The basic balance

The basic balance was considered to be particularly important during the 1950s and 1960s period of fixed exchange rates because it was viewed as bringing together the stable elements in the [balance of payments](.md). It was argued that any significant change in the basic balance must be a sign of a fundamental change in the direction of the [balance of payments](.md). The more volatile elements such as short-term [capital flows](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) and changes in official reserves were regarded as below-the-line items. Although a worsening of the basic balance is supposed to be a sign of a worsening economic situation,  having an overall basic balance deficit is not necessarily a bad thing. For example,  a country may have a [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) deficit that is reinforced by a large long-term capital outflow so that the basic balance is in a large deficit. However,  the capital outflow will yield future profits,  dividends,  and interest receipts that will help to generate future surpluses on the [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md). Conversely,  a surplus in the basic balance is not necessarily a good thing. A [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) deficit which is more than covered by a net long-term capital inflow so that the basic balance is in surplus could be open to two interpretations. It might be argued that because the country is able to borrow over the long run,  there is nothing to worry about,  since the country is regarded as viable by those foreigners who are prepared to lend money over the long run to the country. Another interpretation could argue that the basic balance surplus is a problem because the long-term borrowing will lead to future interest,  profits,  and [dividend payments](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) which will worsen the [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) deficit. 

A country that has a [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) deficit but is a net recipient of FDI could be interpreted as a sign of confidence in the long-term prospects of the economy: the FDI will increase the country’s capital stock and future export earnings. On the other hand,  a country with a [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) deficit and net FDI outflows could be interpreted as a sign of a struggling economy in which [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) opportunities lie abroad rather than at home. Some countries,  such as China,  seem to have a virtuous circle whereby a surplus in the [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) and a positive net FDI inflow leads to an increase in their [net exports](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) in the future. The settlements balance

The [official settlements balance](.md) focuses on the operations that the monetary authorities have to undertake to finance any combined imbalance in the sum of the [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) and financial account. With the settlements concept,  the autonomous items are all the current and financial and capital account transactions including errors,  while the accommodating items are those transactions that the monetary authorities have undertaken as indicated by the settlements balance. The [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) and capital account items are all regarded as being induced by independent households,  firms,  and central and local government and are regarded as the autonomous items. If the sum of the current and capital accounts is negative,  the country can be regarded as being in deficit as this has to be financed by the authorities drawing on their reserves of foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  borrowing from foreign monetary authorities,  or the IMF. The official settlements concept of a surplus or deficit is not as relevant to countries that have floating exchange rates as it is to those with fixed exchange rates. This is because if exchange rates are left to float freely,  the [official settlements balance](.md) will tend to zero because the central authorities neither purchase nor sell their [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  and so there will be no changes in their reserves. If the sales of a [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) exceed the purchases,  then the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) will depreciate; if sales are less than purchases,  the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) appreciates. The settlements concept is,  however,  very important under fixed exchange rates because it shows the amount of pressure on the authorities to devalue or revalue the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). Under a fixed exchange rate system,  a country that is running an official settlements deficit will find that sales of its [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) exceed purchases,  and to avert a devaluation of the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  authorities have to sell reserves of foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) to purchase the home [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). On the other hand,  under floating exchange rates and no intervention,  the [official settlements balance](.md) automatically tends to zero as the authorities do not buy or sell the home [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  since it is left to appreciate or depreciate. Even in a fixed exchange rate regime,  the settlements concept ignores the fact that the authorities have other instruments available with which to defend the exchange rate,  such as capital controls and [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md). Also,  it does not reveal the real threat to the domestic [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) and official reserves represented by the liquid liabilities held by domestic and foreign residents that might switch suddenly out of the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). Although in 1973 the major industrialized countries switched from a fixed to a [floating exchange rate system](China%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves/Currency%20Appreciation%20and%20Depreciation.md),  many developing countries continue to peg their exchange rate to the US dollar and consequently attach much significance to the settlements balance. Indeed,  to the extent that industrialized countries continue to intervene in the [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) market to influence the value of their currencies,  the settlements balance retains some significance,  and news about changes in the reserves of the authorities is of interest to [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) dealers as a guide to the amount of official intervention in the [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) market. 

### 2.8 THE NET INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION AND THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

When a country invests abroad in foreign bonds,  equities,  and money market securities,  it is increasing its holding of external financial assets. On the other hand,  when foreigners purchase domestic bonds,  equities,  and domestic money market securities,  these financial investments are liabilities of the domestic residents to the foreign residents. The difference between a country’s ownership of foreign financial assets and its financial liabilities to foreign residents is known as its net international [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) position (NIIP). If the external financial assets are greater than the external financial liabilities,  then the NIIP of the country will be positive,  and the country is a net creditor nation. If,  however,  the liabilities are greater than the assets,  then the NIIP of the country is negative,  and it is a net debtor. If a country runs a [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) deficit,  then this will mean it has to be financed by either [selling assets](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%206/Week%206%20Assignment%20Review.md) to foreigners or borrowing the funds,  which will worsen its NIIP position by making it less positive or more negative,  other things being equal. On the other hand,  if a country runs a [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) surplus,  then it earns more than it spends as a country and so thereby lends money to the rest of the world and/or repays debts it owes to the rest of the world,  so increasing its assets and/or decreasing its liabilities,  thus making its NIIP less negative or more positive,  other things being equal. Such a country’s [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) deficit/surplus can,   over time,  have a significant impact on its NIIP position.

However,  the NIIP is also affected by things other than the [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md). One of the other major determinants is valuation changes in the external financial assets and liabilities of the country. For example,  if foreign stock markets and foreign bonds held by the domestic residents rise in value,  then the NIIP position improves,  while if they fall in value,  the NIIP deteriorates. Similarly,  a fall in the valuation of domestic financial securities held by foreign residents will improve the NIIP,  while rises in their value lead to a deterioration in the NIIP. The other factor that heavily influences the NIIP is fluctuations in the exchange rate. Consider the case of the United States. It has a negative NIIP since the value of its foreign assets measured in US dollars is less than the value of its liabilities as measured in US dollars. If the US dollar depreciates by 10%,  then its foreign assets become worth more,  measured in US dollars,  while its liabilities are not directly affected by [the fall](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Fall%20of%20Bear%20Stearns%20Lost%20Opportunities%20Haunt%20Final%20Days%20of%20Bear%20Stearns;%20Executives%20Bickeredover%20Raising%20Cash%20Cutting%20Mortgages.md) in the dollar,  and this therefore improves its NIIP,  while an appreciation reduces the value of foreign financial assets,  as measured in US dollars,  so leading to a deterioration in the US NIIP. Of course,  for foreign economies such as Japan and China,  a depreciation of the dollar will mean an appreciation of their currencies,  which reduces the value of their claims on the United States when measured in yen and renminbi,  so leading to a deterioration in their NIIP positions as measured in yen and renminbi.

Countries that tend to run persistent [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) surpluses such as Germany,  China,  and Japan are all creditor nations as measured by their NIIPs. This makes sense,  as countries that run persistent deficits have to finance the deficits by selling foreign assets and increasing their liabilities,  while countries that run persistent surpluses increase their foreign assets by lending and/or are able to reduce their liabilities to foreign residents.

At any point in time,  the United States’ NIIP figure is affected by three factors: (1) the size of the US [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) – a [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) deficit means the NIIP will worsen by the amount of the [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) deficit since it needs to borrow the equivalent sum from foreign residents; (2) changes in the local [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) values of US assets and liabilities,  for example,  the value of foreign stocks and bonds held by US residents (US assets) and the value of US stocks and bonds held by foreign residents (US liabilities) – if US holdings of foreign stocks and bonds rise in price more than foreign holdings of US stocks and bonds,  this helps to improve the United States’ NIIP; and (3) changes in the dollar exchange rate,  for example,  a depreciation of the dollar against the euro will raise the dollar value of US residents’ holdings of euro-denominated assets and thereby help improve the United States’ NIIP.

Any incipient run on the dollar would be offset by foreign central banks accumulating dollar reserves in order to prevent their currencies from appreciating,  because to do otherwise would impose a loss on their countries’ international mercantile competitiveness.

Several mechanisms could lead to an eventual correction of the US [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) deficit: (1) a rise in real US [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md),  which would lead to more private savings and less private [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md),  with an accompanying slowdown in the US economy and net imports; (2) a depreciation of the dollar in real trade-weighted terms.

which over time should increase US exports and decrease imports; (3) a decrease in the US budget deficit via a mixture of tax rises and/or a decrease in government expenditure,  which would again slow the US economy and decrease imports; and (4) an increase in economic growth rates in countries and regions like Japan,  Europe,  and Asia,  which would increase the demand for US exports. One advantage that the USA does have over many other countries is that its external debt is denominated in its own [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md),  unlike typical emerging market economies that often have much of their external debt denominated in foreign currencies; hence,  it can always print the money to service and redeem its debts,  for example,  US Treasury bonds held by foreign central banks. In this sense,  the USA has a large advantage over most emerging market economies: a rapid depreciation of the dollar would not increase the real cost to the United States of servicing its debt,  whereas [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) crises in emerging markets leading to the depreciation of their currencies against the dollar have had major adverse consequences for many of their companies and banks that had dollar-denominated debts. There are clearly significant risks to foreign holders of US assets,  such as the Bank of Japan and the People’s Bank of China,  that have large holdings of US securities and who would suffer substantial losses if US [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) rise and/or the dollar depreciates.

### 2.10 SOME OPEN ECONOMY IDENTITIES

In an open economy,  gross domestic product (GDP) differs from that of a closed economy because there is an additional injection – export expenditure,  which represents foreign expenditure on domestically produced goods. There is also an additional leakage – expenditure on imports,  which represents domestic expenditure on foreign goods and raises foreign national income. The identity for an open economy is given by:

Y CIGX M

If we deduct taxation T from the right-hand side of equation (2.1),  we have:

Y_{d} =C+I +G+XMT

Where Yd is disposable income. If we denote private savings as S = Yd – C,  we can rearrange equation (2.2) to obtain:

(X  M) Current account balance (S  I) Netsaving/ dissaving of the private sector  (T  G)  Government deficit / surplus

Equation (2.3) is an important identity: it says that a [current account](Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md) deficit has a counterpart in either private dissaving,  that is,  private [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) exceeding private saving and/or in a government deficit,  that is,  government expenditure exceeding government taxation revenue.

Equation (2.3) can be rearranged to yield:

IGX STM

## 2.11 OPEN ECONOMY MULTIPLIERS

John Maynard Keynes,  in his classic work The General Theory of Employment,  Interest,  and Money,  published in 1936,  pioneered the use of multiplier analysis to examine the effects of changes in government expenditure and [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) on output and employment.

The assumptions underlying basic multiplier analysis are: (1) both domestic prices and the exchange rate are fixed; (2) the economy is operating at less than full employment,  so that increases in demand result in an expansion of output; and (3) the authorities adjust the money supply to changes in money demand by pegging the domestic interest rate. This latter assumption is important: increases in output that lead to a rise in money demand would,  with a fixed money supply,  lead to a rise in the domestic interest rate – it is assumed that the authorities passively expand the money stock to meet any increase in money demand so that [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) do not have to change. There is no [inflation](Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) resulting from the money supply expansion because it is merely a response to the increase in money demand.

Keynesian analysis proceeds to make assumptions concerning the determinants of the various components of national income. Government expenditure and exports are assumed to be exogenous,  government expenditure being determined independently by political decision,  and exports by foreign expenditure decisions and foreign income. We now introduce taxes into the picture. The simplest way to do this is to assume that taxes are proportional to income: T = tY

where t is the marginal rate of taxation. income,  that is,  the national income less taxes,  i.e. $(1 – t)Y$
$$C = C_a + c(1–t)Y$$

where Ca is autonomous consumption and c is the marginal propensity to consume,  that is,  the fraction of any increase in disposable income that is spent on consumption. 

[!Note]

Box 7.2 The [carry trade](../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) does not make sense according to UIP=

In a [carry trade](../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md),  investors borrow money in a low-interest-rate [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) and place it into a higher-interest-rate [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) in the hope that the latter will either appreciate or not depreciate more than the interest rate differential,  enabling an excess return to be made. The [carry trade](../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) has been increasingly used in recent years by [hedge funds](../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md),  speculators,  and banks despite the fact that UIP theory suggests that it will not produce excess [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) in the long run. Remember,  the UIP condition predicts that over the long run,  the low-interest-rate [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) will on average appreciate by the interest rate differential so as to make the [carry trade](../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) a break-even strategy. Nonetheless,  if UIP does not hold,  then the [carry trade](../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) might work in the short run or even for several years (just as it can also fail at both time horizons). The [carry trade](../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) will prove unprofitable if the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) with the high interest rate depreciates by an amount greater than the interest rate differential over the relevant time horizon. A simple example of the [carry trade](../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) will suffice. Imagine the yen/euro rate is 100 yen per euro,  and the Japanese interest rate is 1%,  and the euro interest rate is 5%. A hedge fund might decide to borrow 10 million yen for one year,  knowing it will have to pay back 10,  100,  000 yen in a year’s time. The hedge fund then sells the yen in the spot market to gain €100,  000,  which will earn 5% in euros and so become €105,  000. So long as the euro has not depreciated to below 96.19 yen/€1,  then the [carry trade](../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) will be profitable. For example,  if the euro actually appreciates to 110 yen/€1,  then the hedge fund will make 1,  450,  000 yen profit (or €13,  181.82). Even if the exchange rate remains at 100 yen/€1,  the hedge fund will be able to convert the €105,  000 and obtain 10,  500,  000 yen and so make a 400,  000 yen profit (or €4,  000). The [carry trade strategy](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Interest%20Rates,%20Carry%20Trades,%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) will break even if the euro depreciates approximately 4% to 96.19 yen/€1 when €105,  000 converts to 10,  100,  000 yen,  which is just sufficient to repay the borrowed 10,  000,  000 yen plus 100,  000 yen interest. However,  there are risks with the [carry trade](../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md). The real danger is if the yen appreciates by substantially more than 4%. Say the yen were to appreciate sharply to 80 yen per euro by the end of the year. In this case,  the €105,  000 will be worth 8,  400,  000 yen,  leaving the hedge fund with a shortfall (loss) of 1,  700,  000 yen of the required 10,  100,  000 yen that it needs to repay,  which is the euro equivalent loss of €21,  250. The various scenarios are depicted in Figure 7.2. According to UIP,  on average,  we can expect the Japanese yen to appreciate to 96.19 so that the expected profit from the [carry trade](../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) is zero. The [carry trade](../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md),  therefore,  implies that markets on average lead to a depreciation of the high-interest-rate [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) less than would be predicted by the interest differential. During the early part of this century,  the [carry trade](../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) proved to be very profitable as the yen–euro rate started at 100 yen/€1 and moved all the way to 170 yen/ €1,  even though the European interest rate was above that of Japan through the period,  as depicted in Figure 7.3. However,  in July 2008,  there was a very abrupt depreciation of the euro from 170 yen/€1 to 115 yen/€1 in the space of just three months,  so that anyone doing the [carry trade](../Clippings/Currency%20Carry%20Trade.md) at that point would have lost very substantially in a very short space of time.

### The IMF and credit facilities

The IMF was set up with its general objective being to oversee and promote international monetary cooperation and the growth of world trade. To these ends,  one of the principal tasks of the Fund was to ensure the smooth functioning of the fixed exchange rate system – in particular,  minimizing the need for countries to devalue and revalue their currencies by providing them with credit facilities with which to finance temporary [balance of payments](.md) deficits. One of the major problems envisaged with the fixed exchange rate system was that countries facing a temporary [balance of payments](.md) deficit would be forced to deflate their economies if they wished to maintain their exchange rate parity. As most governments had committed themselves to the maintenance of full employment,  such a scenario was not particularly appealing. To avert this,  a credit mechanism was set up to provide support for countries facing transitory [balance of payments](.md) problems. Avoidance of deflationary policies was viewed as helpful in maintaining the volume of world trade. Under the [credit facility](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Oaktree%20and%20the%20Restructuring%20of%20Cit%20Group%20(b).md),  each member of the IMF was allocated a quota,  the size of the quota being related to its economic importance as reflected in the size of its subscription to the Fund. A country had to place one-quarter of its quota in reserve assets (mainly gold) and the remaining three-quarters in its own [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) with the Fund. This gave the IMF a stock of funds which could be lent to countries facing [balance of payments](.md) difficulties. A country facing difficulty could draw upon its quota should it need to do so. A country was automatically entitled to the first 25% of its quota,  known as its gold tranche,  and a further four tranches of 25%,  known as credit tranches,  which could be drawn providing the country agreed to conditions set by the IMF which became increasingly austere with each tranche that was drawn. Thus,  in total,  a country could draw a maximum of 125% of its quota. The conditions attached to the latter tranches are known as ‘IMF conditionality’ and generally constitute a set of measures designed to improve a country’s [balance of payments](.md). The IMF commenced operations in March 1947 with the total sum of initial quotas available at$8.8 billion. When drawing upon the IMF resources,  a member purchases reserve assets (usually dollars) in exchange for further deposits of its [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). The Fund decides what assets and currencies the drawing country receives on the basis of the composition of its own resources. As a rule,  any borrowing from the Fund has to be repaid over a period of three to five years. When repaying the Fund,  a country buys back its [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) with foreign reserves.
