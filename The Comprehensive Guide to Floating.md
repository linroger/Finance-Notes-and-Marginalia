# The Comprehensive Guide to Floating-Rate Notes: From Theory to Practice
## Executive Abstract
Floating-Rate Notes (FRNs) represent a fundamental innovation in fixed income markets, offering variable coupons that reset periodically based on reference rates plus a quoted spread. This primer develops a rigorous analytical framework for understanding, pricing, and managing FRNs in today's post-LIBOR environment. FRNs' defining characteristic—minimal price sensitivity to interest rate movements—has made them increasingly valuable tools for balance sheet management, particularly during monetary policy uncertainty. The transition from LIBOR to risk-free rates like SOFR has fundamentally transformed the FRN landscape, requiring practitioners to adapt pricing methodologies, risk metrics, and trading strategies. Understanding these instruments' unique properties allows investors to capitalize on their distinct risk-return profile while enabling issuers to optimize funding strategies across different market environments.
## 1. Foundational Framework: FRN Structure and Mechanics
FRNs differ fundamentally from fixed-rate bonds by offering coupons that periodically reset based on a reference rate. This reset mechanism creates their distinctive interest rate risk profile.
### Cash Flow Mechanics and Reset Dynamics
The cash flow structure of a typical FRN follows a pattern illustrated in this sequence diagram:

    Note over Issuer, Investor: FRN Issuance (t=0)

    Reference_Rate-->>Issuer: Reset Rate (SOFR₁)
    Note right of Issuer: Determine Coupon Rate = SOFR₁ + Quoted Spread

    Issuer->>Investor: Pay Coupon (SOFR₁ + Quoted Spread)

    Note over Issuer, Reference_Rate, Investor: Second Coupon Period
    Reference_Rate-->>Issuer: Reset Rate (SOFR₂)
    Note right of Issuer: Determine Coupon Rate = SOFR₂ + Quoted Spread

    Note over Issuer, Reference_Rate, Investor: Second Coupon Payment (t=2)
    Issuer->>Investor: Pay Coupon (SOFR₂ + Quoted Spread)

    Note over Issuer, Reference_Rate, Investor: ...additional periods...

    Note over Issuer, Reference_Rate, Investor: Final Coupon Period
    Reference_Rate-->>Issuer: Reset Rate (SOFRₙ)
    Note right of Issuer: Determine Coupon Rate = SOFRₙ + Quoted Spread

    Note over Issuer, Reference_Rate, Investor: Maturity (t=n)
    Issuer->>Investor: Pay Final Coupon (SOFRₙ + Quoted Spread)
    Issuer->>Investor: Return Principal Amount
```

For a standard FRN, the coupon payment at time $T_i$ is determined by:
$$C_i = FV \cdot [R(T_{i-1}) + s] \cdot \tau_i$$
where:
- $FV$ is the face value
- $R(T_{i-1})$ is the reference rate observed at time $T_{i-1}$
- $s$ is the quoted spread
- $\tau_i = T_i - T_{i-1}$ is the length of the coupon period in years
### Reference Rate Evolution
Reference rates for FRNs have undergone significant evolution over time:
1. **Historical LIBOR dominance**: For decades, LIBOR served as the primary benchmark for FRNs, offering forward-looking term structure but limited transaction backing.
2. **Transition to risk-free rates**: Following LIBOR manipulation scandals, markets have shifted to transaction-based alternatives:
   - SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) in the U.S.
   - €STR (Euro Short-Term Rate) in Europe
   - SONIA (Sterling Overnight Index Average) in the UK
   - TONA (Tokyo Overnight Average Rate) in Japan
3. **Compounding methodologies**: Unlike LIBOR's forward-looking nature, many new RFRs require compounding methodologies:
   - Simple averaging
   - Compounding in arrears
   - Compounding in advance
   - Term rate structures (e.g., CME Term SOFR)
This reference rate transition fundamentally alters FRN mechanics and creates challenges for pricing existing instruments.
### FRN Variants and Embedded Features
While basic FRNs follow the structure described above, market innovation has created several important variants:
1. **Capped and floored FRNs**: These include upper and/or lower bounds on the coupon, providing protection against extreme interest rate movements.
2. **Range accrual FRNs**: Coupons accrue only when the reference rate falls within a specified range.
3. **Callable/puttable FRNs**: These include early redemption options for the issuer or investor.
4. **Step-up FRNs**: The spread increases at predetermined future dates.
5. **Sustainability-linked FRNs**: Coupons adjust based on the issuer's achievement of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) targets.
Each variant introduces additional complexity for valuation and risk management.
## 2. Analytical Pricing: Risk-Neutral Framework
The foundation for FRN pricing rests on risk-neutral valuation, which equates the instrument's price to the expected present value of future cash flows under the risk-neutral measure.
### Risk-Neutral Valuation Principles
Under the risk-neutral measure $\mathbb{Q}$, the price $V(T_0)$ of a financial instrument at time $T_0$ is given by:
$$V(T_0) = \mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}_{T_0}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{N} CF_i \cdot P(T_0, T_i)\right]$$
where:
- $CF_i$ represents the cash flow at time $T_i$
- $P(T_0, T_i)$ is the discount factor at time $T_0$ for a cash flow at time $T_i$
- $\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}_{T_0}[\cdot]$ denotes the expectation conditional on information available at time $T_0$ under the risk-neutral measure $\mathbb{Q}$
The risk-neutral measure ensures that, when discounted at the risk-free rate, asset prices are martingales.
### Forward Rates and Discount Factors Relationship
The relationship between discount factors and forward rates forms the cornerstone of FRN pricing. The forward rate $F(T_0; T_1, T_2)$ can be derived from discount factors as:
$$F(T_0; T_1, T_2) = \frac{1}{T_2 - T_1} \left(\frac{P(T_0, T_1)}{P(T_0, T_2)} - 1\right)$$
For standard periods of length $\tau$, this simplifies to:
$$F(T_0; T_1, T_2) = \frac{1}{\tau} \left(\frac{P(T_0, T_1)}{P(T_0, T_2)} - 1\right)$$
Conversely:
$$P(T_0, T_2) = \frac{P(T_0, T_1)}{1 + F(T_0; T_1, T_2) \cdot (T_2 - T_1)}$$
### Derivation of the FRN Pricing Formula
For an FRN with face value $FV$, quoted spread $s$, and payment dates $T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_N$, the price at time $T_0$ is:
$$V(T_0) = \mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}_{T_0}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{N} FV \cdot [R(T_{i-1}) + s] \cdot \tau_i \cdot P(T_0, T_i) + FV \cdot P(T_0, T_N)\right]$$
Under the risk-neutral measure, the expected value of the reference rate $R(T_{i-1})$ for the period $[T_{i-1}, T_i]$ equals the forward rate $F(T_0; T_{i-1}, T_i)$:
$$\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}_{T_0}[R(T_{i-1})] = F(T_0; T_{i-1}, T_i)$$
Therefore:
$$V(T_0) = FV \cdot \left[\sum_{i=1}^{N} [F(T_0; T_{i-1}, T_i) + s] \cdot \tau_i \cdot P(T_0, T_i) + P(T_0, T_N)\right]$$
Substituting the relationship between forward rates and discount factors:
$$V(T_0) = FV \cdot \left[\sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[\frac{1}{\tau_i} \left(\frac{P(T_0, T_{i-1})}{P(T_0, T_i)} - 1\right) + s\right] \cdot \tau_i \cdot P(T_0, T_i) + P(T_0, T_N)\right]$$
Simplifying:
$$V(T_0) = FV \cdot \left[\sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[P(T_0, T_{i-1}) - P(T_0, T_i) + s \cdot \tau_i \cdot P(T_0, T_i)\right] + P(T_0, T_N)\right]$$
This telescopes to:
$$V(T_0) = FV \cdot \left[P(T_0, T_0) - P(T_0, T_N) + \sum_{i=1}^{N} s \cdot \tau_i \cdot P(T_0, T_i) + P(T_0, T_N)\right]$$
Since $P(T_0, T_0) = 1$:
$$V(T_0) = FV \cdot \left[1 + \sum_{i=1}^{N} s \cdot \tau_i \cdot P(T_0, T_i)\right]$$
This elegant result reveals a crucial property: if $s = 0$ (no spread), then $V(T_0) = FV$, meaning a pure FRN with zero spread is priced at par on reset dates.
### Numerical Example: FRN Pricing
Consider a 3-year FRN with quarterly coupons based on 3-month SOFR plus a quoted spread of 75 basis points (0.75%). The face value is $1,000, and the current SOFR term structure is:

| Maturity | 3M   | 6M   | 9M   | 1Y   | 1.25Y | 1.5Y | 1.75Y | 2Y   | 2.25Y | 2.5Y | 2.75Y | 3Y   |
|----------|------|------|------|------|-------|------|-------|------|-------|------|-------|------|
| Rate (%) | 4.25 | 4.30 | 4.35 | 4.40 | 4.42  | 4.44 | 4.46  | 4.48 | 4.49  | 4.50 | 4.51  | 4.52 |

Computing discount factors and applying our pricing formula:
$$V(0) = 1000 \cdot [1 + 0.0075 \cdot 0.25 \cdot (0.9894 + 0.9787 + \ldots + 0.8733)]$$
$$V(0) = 1000 \cdot [1 + 0.0075 \cdot 0.25 \cdot 11.5121]$$
$$V(0) = 1000 \cdot [1 + 0.0216]$$
$$V(0) = 1000 \cdot 1.0216 = 1021.60$$
The FRN prices at $1,021.60, slightly above par, reflecting the value of the spread payments over the FRN's life.
### Discount Margin Framework
The discount margin (DM) represents the spread over the reference rate that makes the present value of the FRN equal to its market price. It serves as the primary relative value metric for FRNs.
If we adjust discount factors for the discount margin:
$$P_{DM}(T_0, T_i) = P(T_0, T_i) \cdot e^{-DM \cdot (T_i - T_0)}$$
The FRN price becomes:
$$V(T_0) = FV \cdot \left[1 + \sum_{i=1}^{N} s \cdot \tau_i \cdot P_{DM}(T_0, T_i)\right]$$
Given a market price $M$, we solve for the discount margin $DM$ such that:
$$M = FV \cdot \left[1 + \sum_{i=1}^{N} s \cdot \tau_i \cdot P_{DM}(T_0, T_i)\right]$$
## 3. Risk Metrics: Quantifying FRN Exposures
FRNs exhibit distinct risk characteristics compared to fixed-rate bonds, requiring specialized metrics for effective risk management.
### DV01 / PVBP for Floating-Rate Notes
The Dollar Value of a Basis Point (DV01) or Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP) for FRNs can be decomposed into reset and spread components:
$$\text{DV01}^{\text{FRN}} = \text{DV01}^{\text{Reset}} + \text{DV01}^{\text{Spread}}$$
#### Reset Component
The reset component captures sensitivity to rate changes until the next reset:
$$\text{DV01}^{\text{Reset}} \approx \tau \times P \times 0.0001$$
where $\tau$ is the time to the next reset date (in years) and $P$ is the FRN price.
#### Spread Component
The spread component measures sensitivity to changes in credit or liquidity spreads:
$$\text{DV01}^{\text{Spread}} \approx D_S \times P \times 0.0001$$
where $D_S$ is the spread duration, approximated as:
$$D_S \approx \frac{1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\tau_i}{(1+r_i)^{\tau_i}}}{1 + s \times \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\tau_i}{(1+r_i)^{\tau_i}}}$$
### Effective Duration and Convexity
#### Effective Duration Components
Effective duration for FRNs similarly decomposes into reset and spread components:
$$D_{\text{eff}}^{\text{FRN}} = D_{\text{reset}} + D_{\text{spread}}$$
The reset component equals the time to the next reset:
$$D_{\text{reset}} = \tau$$
The spread component for an FRN trading at par can be approximated as:
$$D_{\text{spread}} \approx \frac{1-\frac{1}{(1+s)^T}}{s}$$
where $T$ is the time to maturity in years.
#### Numerical Calculation
Effective duration can also be calculated numerically:
$$D_{\text{eff}} = -\frac{P_{-} - P_{+}}{2 \times P_0 \times \Delta y}$$
where $P_{-}$ and $P_{+}$ are prices after downward and upward yield shocks of $\Delta y$, respectively.
#### Effective Convexity
Effective convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to yield changes:
$$C_{\text{eff}} = \frac{P_{-} + P_{+} - 2 \times P_0}{P_0 \times (\Delta y)^2}$$
### Option-Adjusted Spread Framework
The Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) framework accounts for embedded options and interest rate uncertainty in FRN valuation.
#### Mathematical Formulation
The OAS is the constant spread that, when added to the risk-free curve, equates the present value of expected cash flows to the market price:
$$P_{\text{market}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{E[CF_i]}{(1+r_i+\text{OAS})^{t_i}}$$
#### Monte Carlo Implementation
Practical OAS implementation for FRNs typically follows these steps:
1. Generate N interest rate scenarios using an appropriate term structure model
2. Project cash flows in each scenario based on simulated reference rates
3. Calculate present values using the risk-free curve plus a constant spread
4. Find the spread that makes the average present value equal to the market price
#### Simplified Approach
A simplified OAS approach adjusts the Z-spread for volatility effects:
$$\text{OAS} = Z\text{-spread} - \text{Volatility Adjustment}$$
### Comparison with Fixed-Rate Bonds
FRNs exhibit fundamentally different risk characteristics compared to fixed-rate bonds:
| Risk Metric | 5-Year Fixed-Rate Bond | 5-Year Quarterly-Reset FRN |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| DV01 | $4,500 | $500 (reset) + $4,000 (spread) = $4,500 |
| Effective Duration | 4.5 years | 0.2 years (reset) + 4.0 years (spread) = 4.2 years |
| Convexity | 22 | 0.2 (reset) + 16 (spread) = 16.2 |
| Behavior when rates increase by 100bp | Price decreases by ~4.5% | Price decreases by ~0.2% (ignoring spread effects) |
| Behavior when credit spreads widen by 100bp | Price decreases by ~4.5% | Price decreases by ~4.0% |
While the total risk may appear similar in some metrics, FRNs have significantly lower interest rate risk but substantial credit and liquidity spread risk.

This visualization reveals several key insights:
1. **Higher spreads increase prices** since they generate higher coupon payments
2. **Increased volatility generally raises prices** due to convexity effects
3. **Par crossing points** indicate the quoted spread at which the FRN would trade at par under different volatility scenarios

## 5. Market Context: FRNs in Practice
Understanding how FRNs function in practice requires examining their market evolution, issuer landscape, and empirical pricing behaviors.
### Historical Evolution
FRNs have evolved significantly from their origins in the 1970s:
1. **Early Development (1970s-1990s)**: Emerged during the volatile interest rate environment of the 1970s, primarily in Eurobond markets with LIBOR as the dominant benchmark.
2. **Market Expansion (1990s-2007)**: Significant standardization of documentation and trading conventions, with increased issuance from diverse market participants.
3. **Global Financial Crisis Impact (2007-2013)**: Liquidity challenges and spread widening, particularly for financial issuers, with questions emerging about LIBOR's reliability.
4. **U.S. Treasury FRN Introduction (2014)**: First new Treasury security since TIPS in 1997, referencing the 13-week Treasury bill auction high rate.
5. **LIBOR to SOFR Transition (2017-Present)**: Fundamental restructuring of the FRN market, with SOFR becoming the predominant reference rate for new U.S. issuance by 2022.
### Issuer Landscape
The FRN market features diverse issuers across multiple sectors:
**Government Issuers**:
- U.S. Treasury (2-year FRNs representing 2.4% of total marketable debt)
- Sovereign and supranational organizations
- Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs)
**Financial Sector** (largest issuer segment):
- Commercial banks (natural asset-liability management benefits)
- Investment banks and broker-dealers
- Insurance companies and asset managers
**Corporate Issuers**:
- Investment-grade corporations seeking funding diversification
- High-yield issuers, particularly in the leveraged loan market
### Empirical Pricing Observations
FRNs exhibit distinct pricing behaviors compared to fixed-rate alternatives:
**Price Stability**: Research by Fleckenstein and Longstaff documents the remarkable stability of Treasury FRNs, with typical price fluctuations of only 2-6 cents per $100 par amount over their entire lifetime.
**Spread Relationships**: Empirical studies show cyclical variation in FRN spreads:
- Tightening during periods of expected rate increases
- Widening during periods of expected rate decreases
**Convenience Yield**: Treasury FRNs demonstrate a significant "convenience yield," trading at a premium relative to synthetic floating-rate exposures created from Treasury bills or notes. This premium averages 6-10 basis points, reflecting the value investors place on FRNs' mark-to-market stability.
**SOFR vs. LIBOR Pricing**: During the reference rate transition, SOFR-linked FRNs consistently priced with tighter spreads than LIBOR-linked alternatives, reflecting the enhanced price stability of SOFR-linked instruments.
### Market Structure and Dynamics
Several structural factors influence FRN markets:
**Liquidity Considerations**:
- Primary market: Relatively strong for Treasury and major financial issuers
- Secondary market: Thinner trading, particularly for corporate FRNs
**Market Segmentation**:
- Money market funds: Primary investors in short-term high-quality FRNs
- Banks: Significant holders of financial sector FRNs
- Asset managers: Diverse holdings across issuer types
**Regulatory Influences**:
- Money market fund reforms (2016) increased demand for government FRNs
- Bank liquidity requirements under Basel III boosted demand for high-quality liquid assets
**Cyclical Patterns**:
- Issuance increases during rising rate environments
- Investor demand strengthens when protection against higher rates is valued
## 6. Practical Applications and Trading Strategies
Understanding FRNs' unique characteristics enables practitioners to develop effective applications and trading strategies.
### Asset-Liability Management
Financial institutions utilize FRNs extensively for balance sheet management:
1. **Interest Rate Risk Reduction**: FRNs allow banks to match floating-rate assets (loans) with similar liabilities, reducing interest rate gaps.
2. **Liquidity Management**: High-quality FRNs (particularly sovereign issues) serve as effective liquidity buffers while generating returns that adjust with market conditions.
3. **Regulatory Optimization**: FRNs can help institutions meet regulatory requirements while minimizing associated costs:
   - Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) compliance using highly-rated FRNs
   - Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) management
### Investment Strategies
Investors can leverage FRNs for various strategic objectives:
1. **Interest Rate Hedging**: FRNs provide natural protection against rising rates without derivatives.
2. **Enhanced Cash Management**: FRNs offer higher yields than money market instruments while maintaining similar price stability.
3. **Relative Value Opportunities**: The spread between FRNs and fixed-rate alternatives often contains exploitable inefficiencies:
   - FRN-swap basis trades
   - Cross-currency basis opportunities
   - Term structure arbitrage
4. **Barbell Strategies**: Combining long-duration fixed-rate bonds with FRNs creates a portfolio with higher yield than intermediate-duration alternatives while maintaining similar duration.
### Issuer Perspectives
Issuers benefit from FRNs in several ways:
1. **Funding Diversification**: FRNs attract investors seeking floating-rate exposure, broadening the issuer's funding base.
2. **Cost Optimization**: In steep yield curve environments, FRNs can reduce initial funding costs compared to fixed-rate alternatives.
3. **Market Timing**: Issuers can exploit market dislocations between fixed and floating markets.
4. **Liability Management**: FRNs allow tailoring of liability profiles to match asset characteristics.
### Risk Management Considerations
Effective FRN risk management requires specialized approaches:
1. **Decomposed Risk Measurement**: Separate analysis of reset and spread components provides more accurate risk assessment.
2. **Scenario Analysis**: Traditional VaR models may understate tail risks for FRNs; comprehensive stress testing across interest rate and spread scenarios is essential.
3. **Basis Risk Management**: Particular attention to potential divergence between funding costs and reference rates, especially during market stress.
4. **Liquidity Risk**: Despite their apparent stability, FRNs can experience significant liquidity challenges during market disruptions.
## 7. Future Developments and Emerging Trends
The FRN market continues to evolve, with several important trends shaping its future trajectory.
### Reference Rate Evolution
While the transition from LIBOR to risk-free rates represents the most significant structural change in the FRN market's history, further developments continue:
1. **Term Rate Development**: Markets continue to refine forward-looking term structures based on risk-free rates:
   - CME Term SOFR gaining acceptance for corporate issuers
   - Similar term rates developing in other currencies
2. **Cross-Currency Consistency**: Efforts to harmonize conventions across currencies to facilitate multi-currency issuance and investment.
3. **Fallback Protocol Standardization**: Ongoing refinement of fallback language for legacy instruments with remaining LIBOR exposure.
### Product Innovation
Market participants continue to develop innovative FRN structures:
1. **ESG-Linked FRNs**: Coupons that adjust based on sustainability performance metrics, with strong growth in European markets.
2. **Digital Infrastructure FRNs**: Securitizations backed by data centers, fiber networks, and other digital infrastructure assets.
3. **Multi-Factor FRNs**: Reference rates that blend traditional benchmarks with other economic indicators or asset class returns.

## Conclusion: The Strategic Role of FRNs
Floating-Rate Notes occupy a distinctive position in fixed income markets, offering unique properties that make them valuable tools for both issuers and investors. Their defining characteristic—minimal price sensitivity to interest rate movements—provides a risk profile unavailable in other instruments without derivatives.
The mathematical framework developed in this primer establishes that FRNs' pricing behavior results directly from the reset mechanism that adjusts coupons to current market rates. This mechanism creates a natural hedge against interest rate risk while introducing exposure to credit and liquidity spread changes.
For practitioners, several key insights emerge:
1. FRNs' risk profile requires specialized metrics focusing on spread risk rather than traditional interest rate sensitivity measures.
2. The empirical convenience yield documented for Treasury FRNs reflects the market value of combining minimal interest rate risk with high credit quality.
3. The LIBOR-SOFR transition fundamentally altered FRN markets, with evidence suggesting enhanced stability for SOFR-linked instruments.
4. FRNs' utility varies cyclically with interest rate expectations, becoming particularly valuable during periods of anticipated rate increases.
5. Product innovation continues to expand the potential applications of floating-rate structures across different market segments.
As monetary policy and market conditions evolve, FRNs will remain essential components of efficient capital markets, providing unique risk-return profiles that complement traditional fixed-rate instruments.
