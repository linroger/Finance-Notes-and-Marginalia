## Introduction & Market Overview
### Definition and Structure
An **Interest-Rate Swap (IRS)** is a bilateral financial derivative contract where two counterparties agree to exchange cash flows based on different interest rate calculations applied to a notional principal amount. In a plain vanilla fixed-for-floating swap:
- **Fixed-rate payer (swap buyer)**: Pays fixed-rate cash flows, receives floating-rate cash flows
- **Floating-rate payer (swap seller)**: Pays floating-rate cash flows, receives fixed-rate cash flows
### Market Context
The global interest-rate derivatives market represents the largest segment of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market:
- **Notional Outstanding**: Approximately $400+ trillion globally (2024)
- **Daily Trading Volume**: $2-3 trillion in IRS across all currencies
- **Primary Currencies**: USD (≈60%), EUR (≈25%), GBP (≈5%), JPY (≈4%)
- **Clearing**: >95% of new USD IRS are centrally cleared post-Dodd-Frank
### Economic Function
Interest-rate swaps serve multiple critical functions:
- **Risk Management**: Hedging interest-rate exposure
- **Asset-Liability Matching**: Duration management for institutions
- **Arbitrage**: Exploiting pricing discrepancies across markets
- **Speculation**: Taking directional views on interest rates

## Mathematical Foundations
### Notation and Setup
Let us establish the mathematical framework:
- $t_0$: Current time (today)
- $T_i$: Payment dates for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$
- $\Delta_i = T_i - T_{i-1}$: Accrual period length
- $N$: Notional principal amount
- $K$: Fixed swap rate (to be determined)
- $L(T_{i-1}, T_i)$: Forward LIBOR rate for period $[T_{i-1}, T_i]$
- $P(t, T)$: Price at time $t$ of zero-coupon bond maturing at $T$
### Zero-Coupon Bond Pricing
Under the risk-neutral measure $\mathbb{Q}$, the fundamental pricing equation is:
$$P(t_0, T_i) = \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}\left[e^{-\int_{t_0}^{T_i} r_s ds}\right]$$
where $r_s$ is the instantaneous risk-free rate.
### Forward Rate Construction
The simply-compounded forward rate $L(T_{i-1}, T_i)$ is related to zero-coupon bond prices by:
$$L(T_{i-1}, T_i) = \frac{1}{\Delta_i}\left(\frac{P(t_0, T_{i-1})}{P(t_0, T_i)} - 1\right)$$
This relationship ensures no-arbitrage between the spot and forward markets.

## Par-Swap Rate Derivation
### Discrete-Time Framework
#### Fixed Leg Present Value
The present value of the fixed leg (from the perspective of the fixed-rate receiver) is:
$$PV_{\text{fixed}} = N \cdot K \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta_i \cdot P(t_0, T_i)$$
#### Floating Leg Present Value
For the floating leg, we use the fact that under no-arbitrage, the present value equals:
$$PV_{\text{floating}} = N \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta_i \cdot L(T_{i-1}, T_i) \cdot P(t_0, T_i)$$
Substituting the forward rate relationship:
$$PV_{\text{floating}} = N \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta_i \cdot \frac{1}{\Delta_i}\left(\frac{P(t_0, T_{i-1})}{P(t_0, T_i)} - 1\right) \cdot P(t_0, T_i)$$
$$= N \sum_{i=1}^n \left(P(t_0, T_{i-1}) - P(t_0, T_i)\right)$$
This telescopes to:
$$PV_{\text{floating}} = N(P(t_0, T_0) - P(t_0, T_n)) = N(1 - P(t_0, T_n))$$
#### Par-Swap Rate Formula
At inception, the swap has zero net present value: $PV_{\text{fixed}} = PV_{\text{floating}}$
$$N \cdot K \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta_i \cdot P(t_0, T_i) = N(1 - P(t_0, T_n))$$
Solving for the par-swap rate:
$$\boxed{K = \frac{1 - P(t_0, T_n)}{\sum_{i=1}^n \Delta_i \cdot P(t_0, T_i)}}$$
### Continuous-Time Framework (Heath-Jarrow-Morton)
#### HJM Setup
Under the Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework, forward rates $f(t, T)$ evolve according to:
$$df(t, T) = \alpha(t, T)dt + \sigma(t, T)dW_t$$
where the drift $\alpha(t, T)$ is determined by the no-arbitrage condition:
$$\alpha(t, T) = \sigma(t, T)\int_t^T \sigma(t, s)ds$$
#### Continuous-Time Par Rate
In the continuous limit, the par-swap rate becomes:
$$K = \frac{1 - P(t_0, T_n)}{\int_0^{T_n} P(t_0, s)ds}$$
This represents the ratio of the "floating leg duration" to the "fixed leg duration."
### No-Arbitrage Relationships
The par-swap rate must satisfy several no-arbitrage conditions:
1. **Spot-Forward Consistency**: 
   $$K \approx \frac{1}{T_n}\int_0^{T_n} f(t_0, s)ds$$
2. **Futures-Forward Convexity Adjustment**:
   $$\text{Swap Rate} = \text{Futures Rate} - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 T \cdot \text{Duration}$$

## Risk Metrics & Greeks
### Duration and DV01
#### Modified Duration of Fixed Leg
The modified duration of the fixed leg is:
$$D_{\text{fixed}} = \frac{1}{PV_{\text{fixed}}} \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta_i \cdot T_i \cdot P(t_0, T_i)$$
#### DV01 Calculation
The DV01 (dollar value of a basis point) measures the change in swap value for a 1bp parallel shift in the yield curve:
$$\text{DV01}_{\text{swap}} = N \cdot K \cdot D_{\text{fixed}} \cdot 0.0001$$
For a $100MM notional swap:
$$\text{DV01}_{\text{swap}} = 100,000,000 \cdot K \cdot D_{\text{fixed}} \cdot 0.0001$$
### Key-Rate Durations
#### Bucketed Risk Decomposition
To capture non-parallel yield curve shifts, we decompose the DV01 into key-rate buckets:
$$\text{DV01}_{\text{bucket}_j} = \frac{\partial PV}{\partial r_j} \cdot 0.0001$$
where $r_j$ is the yield in bucket $j$.
#### Mathematical Formulation
For the fixed leg, the key-rate DV01 for bucket $j$ is:
$$\text{DV01}_j^{\text{fixed}} = N \cdot K \sum_{i: T_i \in \text{bucket}_j} \Delta_i \cdot T_i \cdot P(t_0, T_i) \cdot 0.0001$$
### Convexity Analysis
#### Second-Order Effects
The convexity of a swap measures the curvature of the price-yield relationship:
$$\text{Convexity} = \frac{1}{PV} \frac{\partial^2 PV}{\partial r^2}$$
For the fixed leg:
$$C_{\text{fixed}} = \frac{1}{PV_{\text{fixed}}} \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta_i \cdot T_i^2 \cdot P(t_0, T_i)$$
#### Convexity Adjustment for Futures
When hedging swaps with futures, a convexity adjustment is required:
$$\text{Hedge Ratio} = \frac{D_{\text{swap}}}{D_{\text{futures}}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2}(C_{\text{swap}} - C_{\text{futures}})(\Delta r)^2\right)$$
### Risk Aggregation
The total portfolio DV01 aggregates as:
$$\text{DV01}_{\text{portfolio}} = \sum_i w_i \cdot \text{DV01}_i$$
where $w_i$ are the position weights.

## Advanced Extensions
### Cross-Currency Swaps
#### Structure and Mechanics
A cross-currency swap involves exchanging cash flows denominated in different currencies. The generic structure includes:
1. **Initial Exchange**: Principal amounts in different currencies
2. **Periodic Payments**: Interest payments in respective currencies  
3. **Final Exchange**: Re-exchange of principal amounts
#### Pricing Formula
Let $S_0$ be the current spot FX rate (domestic per foreign), and $P^d(t,T)$, $P^f(t,T)$ be domestic and foreign discount factors.
The par-swap rate relationship becomes:
$$K^d \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta_i^d P^d(t_0, T_i) = \frac{S_0}{S_T} K^f \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta_i^f P^f(t_0, T_i)$$
Under the foreign risk-neutral measure:
$$\boxed{K^d = K^f \cdot \frac{S_0 \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta_i^f P^f(t_0, T_i)}{\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}^f}[S_T^{-1}] \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta_i^d P^d(t_0, T_i)}}$$
#### FX Risk Components
The cross-currency swap embeds several risk factors:
- **Interest Rate Risk**: In both currencies
- **FX Risk**: Spot rate movements
- **Correlation Risk**: Between rates and FX
- **Basis Risk**: Cross-currency basis spread
### Forward-Starting Swaps
#### Definition and Applications
A forward-starting swap begins at a future date $T_{\text{start}} > t_0$. Applications include:
- **Lock-in Future Financing Costs**: For anticipated funding needs
- **Hedge Future Exposures**: Asset-liability matching
- **Speculative Positioning**: Views on forward rate movements
#### Analytical Pricing
The par rate for a forward-starting swap is:
$$K_{\text{forward}} = \frac{P(t_0, T_{\text{start}}) - P(t_0, T_n)}{\sum_{i=1}^n \Delta_i P(t_0, T_i)}$$
#### Risk Characteristics
Forward-starting swaps exhibit unique risk properties:
- **Higher Convexity**: Due to optionality embedded in forward start
- **Volatility Sensitivity**: Depends on forward rate volatility
- **Model Risk**: Requires sophisticated term structure models
### Swaptions and Embedded Options
#### European Swaptions
A swaption grants the right (not obligation) to enter a swap at a predetermined rate. Under the Black model:
$$\text{Swaption Price} = A \cdot \left[K \Phi(d_1) - S_0 \Phi(d_2)\right]$$
where:
- $A = \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta_i P(t_0, T_i)$ (annuity factor)
- $S_0$ = current forward swap rate
- $d_1, d_2$ = Black-Scholes parameters adjusted for swaption volatility
#### Bermudan Swaptions
Bermudan swaptions allow early exercise on multiple dates, requiring:
- **Lattice Methods**: Binomial/trinomial trees
- **Monte Carlo**: With least-squares regression (Longstaff-Schwartz)
- **PDE Methods**: Finite difference schemes

All rate quotations use basis points (1bp = 0.01%):
- **Bid-Offer Spreads**: Typically 0.5-2bp for liquid tenors
- **Tick Size**: 0.25bp for most electronic platforms
### Settlement and Clearing
#### Central Clearing Requirements
Post-Dodd-Frank regulations mandate central clearing for:
- **Standardized IRS**: Plain vanilla fixed-for-floating
- **Major Currencies**: USD, EUR, GBP, JPY
- **Eligible Counterparties**: Swap dealers, major participants
#### Margin Requirements
- **Initial Margin**: Risk-based (SIMM methodology)
- **Variation Margin**: Daily mark-to-market settlements
- **Minimum Transfer Amount**: Typically $100,000-$500,000
---
## Practical Applications
### Portfolio Risk Management
#### Duration Matching
Financial institutions use IRS for asset-liability duration matching:
$$\text{Duration Gap} = D_{\text{assets}} - \frac{L}{A} \cdot D_{\text{liabilities}}$$
where $L/A$ is the leverage ratio.
#### Optimal Hedging
The optimal hedge ratio minimizes portfolio variance:
$$h^* = \frac{\text{Cov}(\Delta S, \Delta F)}{\text{Var}(\Delta F)}$$
### Corporate Treasury Applications
#### Fixed-Rate Debt Conversion
A corporation with floating-rate debt can synthetically create fixed-rate exposure:
**Floating-Rate Debt + Pay-Fixed IRS = Synthetic Fixed-Rate Debt**
#### Cost of Capital Optimization
Companies optimize their capital structure using swaps:
- **Natural Hedging**: Match cash flow patterns
- **Market Timing**: Take advantage of rate expectations
- **Credit Arbitrage**: Exploit comparative advantages
### Speculative Strategies
#### Curve Positioning
Traders implement directional and relative value strategies:
- **Curve Steepeners/Flatteners**: Long/short different maturities
- **Butterfly Trades**: Bet on curve shape changes
- **Basis Trades**: Exploit mispricings between instruments
#### Volatility Trading
- **Long Volatility**: Buy swaptions when implied vol < realized vol
- **Short Volatility**: Sell swaptions when implied vol > realized vol
- **Gamma Trading**: Dynamically hedge option positions

## Risk Management Framework
### Value-at-Risk (VaR)
For a swap portfolio, the 1-day 95% VaR can be calculated using:
$$\text{VaR}_{0.95} = 1.65 \times \sqrt{\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{w}}$$
where $\mathbf{w}$ is the vector of key-rate DV01s and $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is the covariance matrix of daily rate changes.
### Expected Shortfall
Expected Shortfall (Conditional VaR) provides a coherent risk measure:
$$\text{ES}_{0.95} = \mathbb{E}[\text{Loss} | \text{Loss} > \text{VaR}_{0.95}]$$
### Stress Testing
Regulatory stress tests include:
- **Parallel Shifts**: ±200bp across all tenors
- **Steepening/Flattening**: Non-parallel curve movements
- **Volatility Shocks**: Increases in implied volatilities
- **Liquidity Stress**: Widening bid-offer spreads
