For paragraphs or parts covering complex topics or phenomena involving many stages linked in a causal chain, you should add a callout below to explain the ideas further, and elaborate with you own intuitive explanation to make the concepts more clear and digestible for the user. This is the format to create callouts: > [!info] > Here's a callout block. > It supports **Markdown**, [[Internal link|Wikilinks]], and [[Embed files|embeds]]! > ![[Engelbart.jpg]]. There are alot of complex ideas discussed in this work so do not hesistate to make use of callouts to explain the ideas further and make them more clear. Whenewver you feel that a particular section or partagraph makes a leap without explaining why something must be so, or elaborating on the chain of cause and effect relations, you should introduce a callout below to explain further.
