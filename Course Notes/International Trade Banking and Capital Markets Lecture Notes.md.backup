###  International Trade and Globalization
- What is globalization?
- Why was it viewed as so successful for 50 years?
- Why is it now viewed as flawed?
- How will [international trade](../International%20Finance/Globalization/Chapter%202-The%20Principle%20Of%20Comparative%20Advantage.md) and migration change in the coming years?

### Banking and International Capital Markets
- How are currencies bought and sold?
- How do central banks manage their exchange rates?
 - Why does [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) capital flow across borders?
 - What are the implications of governments' actions for international capital markets?

##  Trade Terms
- Exports - what a country sells to other countries
 - Imports - what a country buys from other countries
 - Applies to both goods and services
 - Trade Balance
- Surplus - exports exceed imports
 - Deficit - imports exceed exports
 - Balanced trade - exports equals imports

##  Trade Terms
- Bilateral Trade - trade between two countries
- Multilateral Trade - trade between a country and rest of world
- [Trade policy instruments](.md)
- Tariffs - taxes on imported products
- Quotas - limits set on amount of a product imported from a country - sometimes "voluntary"
 - Sanctions - bans importation of products from a country - e.g., Russian products banned after Ukraine invasion

##  Trade Terms
- Initial models presented in course
- Direct, bilateral exchange of finished products
 - No financing available
- Subsequently discuss intermediate goods and services trade
- Introduce multilateral trade
 - Value-added at each stage - iPhone example from text
 -  New methods of delivery - Offshoring

###  Trade and Macroeconomics
- If you've taken introductory macroeconomics, you've seen this equation:$$Y=C+I+G+EX-IM$$, where
- $Y$ = GDP,
- $C$ = Consumption,
- $I$ = [Investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md),
- $G$ = Government Spending,
- $EX$ = Exports and
- $IM$ = Imports$EX - IM$ is known as the trade balance,
    - if $EX - IM < 0$, the trade balance is in deficit,
    - if $EX - IM > 0$  the trade balance is in surplus

###  Determining the Trade Balance
- Rearrange the identity above, and solve for EX - IM
First subtract taxes from both sides of the equation:
from each side subtract consumption and [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), to obtain $$(Y-T-C)-I=G-T+EX-IM$$,$Y-T$ represents disposable income and$S_p=Y-T-C$ is private savings, substituting $S_p$ in and moving $G-T$ to the left hand side, we obtain$$(S_p-I)+(T-G)=EX-IM$$

##  Interpreting the Trade Balance
. $(S_p-I)$ represents the difference between private savings and [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)
. $(T-G)$ equals taxes minus government spending or public [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)
- If both $(S_p-I)$ and $(T-G)$ are less than zero, then $EX - IM<0$ , so there must be a [trade deficit](../International%20Finance/Globalization/Chapter%2014-%20Capital%20Flows%20and%20the%20Current%20Account.md)
 - Text notes: "... Trade balance of the economy is determined by the macroeconomic saving behavior of the households and
The government." Do you agree with this interpretation?

#  Global Trade
- To understand globalization we need to understand:
- The incentives for countries to trade
 - The barriers to trade
- Trade is thousands of years old, but:
- Has only constituted a meaningful part of national and global income in past 150 years
 - [Intermediate goods trade](../International%20Finance/Globalization/Chapter%206-Intermediate%20Input%20Trade%20and%20Offshoring.md) became significant only in past 30 years

###  World Trade Flows
- Goods trade as a percentage of global income:
    - 1820 - 2%;
    - 1913 - 22%;
    - 2008 - approximately 50%
- Why do trade flows increase over time relative to global income?
-   A) Reductions in transportation costs
    - B) Reductions in tariffs
     - C) "Common" [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)
     - D) Convergence of income among countries

###  Global Goods Trade Relative to Global Income
- Estevadeordal, Frantz, and Taylor (2003) examine potential determinants of relative increases and decreases in global goods trade relative to global output from 1870 to 1939
- Study total world trade
- Utilize the gravity equation
- Examine potential frictions simultaneously
- Attempt to determine relative impact
- Previous studies have focused on one factor at a time

#  Estevadeordal, Frantz, and Taylor
. Traditional Narrative.
- From 1800 to 1914 trade volume increases 20 times and approximately 10 times versus global income
- First Golden Age of Trade - 1870 - 1913
- Acceleration in rate of growth after 1870
 - Dramatic decrease in transportation costs . Steam power mobilized
 -  Stable monetary environment - Gold Standard
 - Tariffs low - minimal role

##  Estevadeordal, Frantz, and Taylor
- Post 1914 - 1939 "bust" during interwar period
- Traditionally attributed to increased tariffs and protectionism
- Little quantitative support for this explanation
- However, transportation costs rose dramatically during this period
- Technology changes
 -  Restrictive cartels and labor practices

- Findings:
- Model explains most of rise and fall in world trade
- Substantial portion explained by "common [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)"
- Rise and fall of the gold standard
- Tariffs small role early -important during interwar period
- Transport costs - fall and rise - important in rise and decline of trade
- Income convergence - unimportant after 1870

##  Migration Terms
- Immigrants - persons entering a country from another for an extended period
- Workers with or without family members
- Emigrants - persons leaving a country for another for an extended period
- Refugees - persons forced to leave a country due to inability to safety

##  Migration and Politics
: Increasingly offshoring substitutes for direct migration
- European migration: East to West
- Schengen Area - 26 countries
 - Syrian refuge crisis
 - Brexit
- US and Mexico
- Maquiladoras

##  Foreign Direct Investment
 Vertical
- Invest in some portion of business functions
- Often labor cost driven
 Horizontal
- Adding complete business in another country
- Believe business model appeals to potential customers

##  Models of International Trade
- Principal Models
- Ricardian - Technology
- Specific Factors - Capital resources immobile
- Heckscher-Ohlin -- Capital resources mobile (offshoring)
- Gravity - Frictional costs (transportation, tariffs and [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) stability)

##  Limitations of Models
. Simplified assumptions:
- One or two labor skill levels
 - Distributional impacts limited or ignored
- No fragility
- Crop failures
 -  Pandemics
 - Wars
 -  Production stoppages
 -  Security concerns
- All have substantial economic and political consequences

##  Studies of Wage and Employment Data
- Examine applications of the theory presented in previous lecture
- Within supply chain data difficult to obtain
. Differentiate workers between:
- Production (low-skilled)
- Nonproduction (high-skilled)
- Impact on relative wages and employment
Offshoring and Technology Impact on Wages and Employment
- Late 1960's through early 1980's
- Large increase in availability of college graduates
- Lowered relative cost of recent graduates
- Beginning of business use of computers and programmers
- Greater sophistication in “back office"
 - Marketing and sales usage
- Imports grow more rapidly as proportion of GDP

##  Offshoring and Technology Impact on Wages and Employment 1
- 1982 through 1992 - Feenstra and Hanson (1996, 1997) studied imported intermediates
-  Consistent with 1980's data, predicted offshoring would increase:
- Relative demand for high-skilled labor to low-skilled labor in importing and exporting country
 - Relative wage of high-skilled labor to low-skilled labor in importing and exporting country
- Imports flat as a proportion of GDP during this period
Offshoring and Technology Impact
- By 1992 it's a different story
- Skilled workers continue to see wages rise
- Skilled workers' proportion of the workforce declines
- Offshoring and robotics initially reduced relative number of production jobs
- Now reduces many nonproduction positions
 - Nonproduction labor replaced by software for routine tasks - increasingly integrated systems

##  Offshoring and Technology Impact
- Late 1990's through 2012
- Nonproduction relative wage and proportion of labor force increase resumes
 - Relative wages of skilled workers hit by early 2000's recession but resumes relative growth thereafter
- Imports relative to GDP resume growth
- Except during recession

- Heckscher-Ohlin model would lead to expectation of period beginning in 1982 to lead to:
- Decrease in relative demand for nonproduction workers
- Observed increase due to rightward shift in relative demand curve within industries, propelled by:
- Offshoring
- Skill-based technology change
 Robotics
 -  Computers

###  Is Offshoring Different?
- In its effects on relative prices, [return on capital](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md), and labor and wages
 - When compared to final goods trade and immigration

#  Is Offshoring Different?
- Build on model presented last lecture
- Demonstrate gains to firms and consumers from offshoring
 - Impact on labor more complex
- Have seen that relative wages rise for high-skilled labor in both importing and exporting country

##  Simple Offshoring Model
- Two countries, two processes, two types of workers
- Home and Foreign
- R&D and components
- High-skilled and low-skilled
- Both types of labor required for each process
 - Different relative mix
- Firm tradeoffs measured with isoquants
 - Curve along which production remains constant with differing combinations of factor inputs

###  Simple Offshoring Model
- Firm wants to maximize Y given budgetary constraints on inputs: R&D and Components
- Without trade, the firm will produce at point A
- Point on PPF where $Y=Y_0$
- Tangent line slope = (P) A
-  $P_{\mathcal{C}}$ and $P_{R,}$ internal prices for components and R&D

###  Firm R&D-Component Trade-off: Autarky
 ![500](Attachments/500-620.jpg)

##  Allow Offshoring of Activities
- Assume that compared to Home:
- Foreign plant manufactures components at lower cost, or
 - R&D exported from Home to Foreign plant lowers cost
. Either implies: $(\frac{P_C}{P_R})^{W1}<(\frac{P_C}{P_R})^A$
- As with trade in finished goods under Heckscher-Ohlin
 - Value to both countries through trade in intermediates
 - Through relative wage differentials or capital costs

###  Firm R&D-Component Trade-off: Trade
 ![500](Attachments/500-584.jpg)

###  Fm R&D-Component Trade-off: Trade
Since,$$(\frac{P_C}{P_R})^{W1}<(\frac{P_C}{P_R})^A$$
- Home firm will import components, export R&D
- Home firm production equilibrium moves to B
- Produces greater R&D for export
- Imports components on X axis equal to $Q_C-Q_B$
- Output increases from $Y_0$ to $Y_1$
- Home gains from offshoring

##  Terms of Trade
·Two cases:
- Foreign improves productivity in good it exports
-  Foreign improves productivity in good Home exports
- First case lowers component prices
- Home's terms of trade rise
- Second case lowers R&D prices
- Home's terms of trade decline - still better than autarky

###  Fall in Price of Components
 ![500](Attachments/500-584.jpg)

##  Fall in Price of Components
Assume,$$P_Cfalls\mathrm{~s.t.,}(\frac{P_C}{P_R})^{W2}<(\frac{P_C}{P_R})^{W1}$$
-  Home firm increases component imports and decreases R&D exports
- Home firm production equilibrium moves from B to B'
 - Imports components on X axis equal to:$$Q^{\prime}{}_{C^{\prime}}-Q^{\prime}{}_{B^{\prime}}>Q_C-Q_B$$
- Output increases from $Y_1$ to Y 2
- Terms of trade improve

###  Fall in Price of R&D
 ![500](Attachments/500-584.jpg)

##  Fall in Price of R&D
Assume ,$$P_Rfallss.t.,(\frac{P_C}{P_R})^{W3}>(\frac{P_C}{P_R})^{W1}$$
-  Home firm decrease component imports and R&D exports
 - Home firm production equilibrium moves from B to B"
 -  Imports components on X axis equal to:$$Q^{\prime\prime}C^{\prime\prime}-Q^{\prime\prime}B^{\prime\prime}<Q_C-Q_B$$
- Output decreases from $Y_1$ to $Y_3$ but still greater than $Y_0$
- Terms of trade decline

###  Fall in Price of R&D
- Paul Samuelson noted, for example, that the US could become worse off if large nations such as China or India become more competitive in products and services the US exports
- Version of the Prebisch-Singer Hypothesis
 - Still better off than no trade
 - Gains are not distributed evenly

Offshoring of Goods and Services I
October 25,2022

#  Offshoring
- Foreign outsourcing or offshoring
- Often used interchangeably
-  Offshoring also more specifically refers to retaining ownership while moving operations overseas
-  Outsourcing used when referring to moving production of components to other firms
- Almost always involves trade in intermediate goods and services

#  Offshoring
- Constraints 1
- Costs of moving:
 - Goods
 - Ideas
 - People
- Three "unbundlings"
- Reduction of (finished) goods trade costs
 -  Reduction of communications costs
 -  Reduction of face-to-face interaction costs

#  Offshoring
- Offshoring enabled by the ICT revolution
- Information and communication technology
- Propelled by
- Rapid increases in computer processing power - Moore's Law
 -  Even faster increases in communication bandwidth - Gilder's Law
 -  Network effects of communication - Metcalfe's Law

##  Offshoring
. Additional enablers
- Air cargo
- Logistics management techniques
- Incremental value-added supply chains
 - Trade in "tasks" versus components

#  Offshoring
- Involves only a portion of activities required to produce final good
- Similar effects to immigration
- Import less expensive labor
- No physical movement of people required
- Regions or countries specialize in specific tasks or activities in value chain
- Led in US and other industrialized countries to job polarization

#  Offshoring
- Discuss winners and losers from offshoring
- Among countries
- Among different worker skill-levels
- Discuss recent countertrends
- Coronavirus
 - Ukraine/Russia war
 - China/US tensions

##  Offshoring Model
 ![500](Attachments/500-585.jpg)

##  Offshoring Model Assumptions.
- Relative wage of low-skilled workers to high-skilled workers in certain countries is lower than in others
- Use Home and Foreign example
- Home: low - skilled wage, W,, high - skilled , $W_H$
 - Foreign: low - skilled wage, $W_L^*$ ,high - skilled, W*
- Relative wage in Foreign lower than Home, $\frac{W_L^*}{W_H^*}<\frac{W_L}{W_H}$
- Cost of capital and trade uniform across all activities in the value chain

#  Offshoring Model
- Feenstra (2017) offshoring model to explain demand shift
 - Assumptions:
- Define $z_E (0,1)$ as measure of tasks (subassemblies) in a process ordered by low to high skilled labor requirement
- Profit maximization assumption
    - Minimize cost, c$$w_H/w_L<w_H^*/w_L^*$$
- Countries specialize in different inputs or tasks

##  Initial Offshore Decision Cost Curve
 ![500](Attachments/500-534.jpg)

#  Offshoring Model.
- Now Home desires to offshore more inputs or tasks
- New [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) flows into Foreign
- Alternatively, technology progresses relatively quickly in Foreign
- Either or both create lower Foreign rental rate
- [Investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) or technological progress shift c/c* up
- Activities undertaken by Foreign increase from z' to z"

##  Post-investment Cost Curve Shift
 ![500](Attachments/500-565.jpg)

##  Effect on Employment and Wages
- This causes the relative labor demand curve, D (z) to
- Shift to the right oWhy?

##  Effect on Employment and Wages
- This causes the relative labor demand curve, D (z) to
- Shift to the right OWhy?
- Foreign moves into relatively more complex activities
- Remaining activities in Home are the most skill intensive

#  Impact on Demand for Labor and Relative Wage
Figure 6
 ![500](Attachments/500-617.jpg)

##  Relative Demand for Labor

##
 -  Initially least-skilled activities sent to Foreign
 ![500](Attachments/500-585.jpg)

##  Changes in Relative Costs
- As in the model above:
- Non-labor costs fall in Foreign
 Capital inflows
 -  Trade barriers reduced
 -  Technology reduces communication and transportation costs
- Home initially moved its least-skilled activities to Foreign
- Remaining Home activities now more skilled on average
 - Given Foreign lower non-labor costs, Home may move higher skill tasks to Foreign
Moving Up the Value Chain
 ![500](Attachments/500-619.jpg)
- Given Home's lower non-labor costs
 - Home moves to more complex activities, from A to B
- Skill levels of activities increase in both countries

##  Impact on Labor Markets
- Foreign labor demand and relative wage level
- Increased relative need for high-skilled labor
- Shifts demand curve to the right, equilibrium moves from *A to B*
 - Increases both ·Relative wage level, $W_H^*/W_L^*$
 -  Relative amount of high-skilled versus low-skilled labor, $H^*/L^*$
- Likely that absolute demand for both high- and low-skilled workers increases

##  Impact on Labor Markets
- Home labor demand and relative wage level
- Increased relative need for high-skilled labor
- Shifts demand curve to the right, equilibrium moves from A to B
 -  Increases both
 - Relative wage level, $W_H/W_L$
 -  Relative amount of high-skilled versus low-skilled labor, H / L
- Likely that absolute demand for both high- and low-skilled workers decreases

##  Impact on Labor Markets
 ![500](Attachments/500-580.jpg)

##  Trade versus Skill-based Technology Change
- Impact on Home, based Heckscher Ohlin model
- Finished goods trade causes the following:
- Ratio of high-skilled to low-skilled employees to decline
 -  Ratio of high-skilled to low-skilled wages to rise
- Imports take away production positions in higher numbers than sales and management roles
 Skill-based technology effects cause high-skilled to low-skilled relative employment and wages rise

- Allowing multiple factors and products (sectors)
- Produces different results dependent on
- Size of country
 - Decomposition of intermediate products and tasks
- The balance between
- Lower productivity "Technology" benefit.
- There are important data and methodological issues in these studies

##  Summarizing Globalization
- Until the advent of the Covid pandemic:
- Production processes increasingly fragmented
- Sending to near (or far) low-wage nations
 -  Many sole or limited number of suppliers
 - Industrial know-how often sent with production
- Recent changes in globalization changing its impact
- Changing the nature of international competition
 - Operating at finer resolution the previously

##  Summarizing Globalization
- National comparative advantage only applies narrowly
- Not meaningful in many finished product areas
-  Global companies compete more narrowly within each country in which they operate
- Who wins? And Who loses? No longer nationally defined
- Determined by skillsets
- Knowledge advantages
Monopolistic Competition and the Gravity Equation
October 20,2022

##  Economies of Scale
- One simplifying assumption of trade models so far:
- Constant [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) to scale
- There are increasing [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) to scale in many businesses
- Two types of increasing [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) to scale
- External: depends on size of industry, not size of individual firm
 - Internal: depends on size of each firm, economies of scale are within a firm's own production function

##  External and Internal Economies of Scale
- External economies of scale dependent on:
- Unit costs a function of size of industry, not the individual company
 - Example: injection molding
- Internal economies of scale dependent on:
- Unit costs which are a function of firm size
- Examples: automotive; computer chip manufacture; retail [banking](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md); search and social networking software
Differentiated Goods and Competition
- If goods are undifferentiated may lead to true monopoly
- Many goods and services are differentiated
- Leads to form of imperfect competition known as Monopolistic Competition
. Monopolistic Competition
- Several firms produce differentiated versions of same product
- Industry has increasing [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) to scale

###  Remember from Microeconomics
- Perfect (Pure) Competition
-  Each firm prices where marginal revenue = marginal cost
 - No firm large enough to move the market price; each firm faces a horizontal demand curve
- Monopoly
- Price every unit where marginal revenue = marginal cost
 - Marginal revenue always below the industry demand curve; monopolist faces downward sloping demand curve

#  Perfect Competition Equilibrium
Figure 8.1 Market and Firm Demand in Perfect Competition
 ![500](Attachments/500-568.jpg)
(a) In the perfectly competitive market for Grade-A large eggs, farmers supply millions of dozens of eggs at a market price of $\$2.25$ per dozen. (b) Ty, an individual supplier of dozens of eggs in the market, must sell at the price set
By the market. Hence, he faces a perfectly elastic demand curve at the market price of \$2.25 per dozen.

At the initial market price $P_{1}$ ,the perfectly competitive firm is maximizing profit at $Q^*1$ ,where $P=MC.$ If price increases to $P_2$ ,the firm should increase output to $Q^*2$ .If, instead, price decreases to $P_3$ ,the firm is maximizing profit at $Q^*3$

###   Monopoly Equilibrium
 ![500](Attachments/500-544.jpg)

##  Monopoly Equilibrium
- To increase sales the monopolist must lower price
- Faces downward sloping demand curve
-  No upward sloping industry supply curve since no competitors
- Monopolist continues to sell and lower price until profits are maximized
- Until marginal revenue = marginal cost
- To sell an additional unit at this point will reduce profits

##  Monopoly: Efficiency Losses versus Perfect Competition
 ![500](Attachments/500-584.jpg)
Goolsbee et al., Microeconomics, 3 e, $①$ 2020 Worth Publishers$\bullet$ Efficiency losses - monopolist price, $\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{mi}}^*$ , greater than $\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{c}}^{*}$ competitive market price. Quantity available, $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathrm{mi}}^*$ , less than $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{c}}^*$ , competitive market quantity

###  Duopoly
 ![500](Attachments/500-586.jpg)

#  Duopoly
- Industry demand curve, D
- Both firms price identically
- Split market evenly
 -  Demand Curve for each firm is D/2
 -  Sales equal Q 2, % of Q 1
- Add [product differentiation](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Porter's%20Five%20Forces.md)
- One firm lowers price to P 2
- Captures more than % of market, but not all, sells Q 4 units

#  Duopoly
- Differentiated products flatten the demand curve for each firm
-  Only one firm lowers price
 - Consumer price elasticity increases
- Higher price product retains some share
- Industry quantity increases
 - Lower price firm takes quantity away from high price firm

##  Trade under Monopolistic Competition
 Assumptions
- Goods produced by all firms are similar but differentiated from other firms
- Several firms compete in the industry
- Technology used by firms provides increasing [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) to scale (economies of scale)
- Firms enter and exit freely
- Long-run industry profits fall to zero
 -  If firms' cost structures vary, high cost firms will exit

##  Short-run Monopolistic Competition in Autarky
 ![500](Attachments/500-618.jpg)
Short-run Monopolistic Competition in Autarky
- Outcome is similar to monopoly
- All firms face demand curve do
 - Each firm produces Qo where mro = MC
- Price, Po, exceeds AC, and firm earns a monopoly profit
- Seeing monopoly profit opportunity
- New firms enter the industry
 - Drawing demand from existing firms

##   Long-run Monopolistic Competition in Autarky
 ![500](Attachments/500-618.jpg)
Long-run Monopolistic Competition in Autarky
- D is industry demand. $NA$ is number of firms in industry
- Entry of new firms
- Increasing number of product variations (near substitutes)
- Increasing consumer [price sensitivity](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Duration.md)
 - Demand becomes increasingly elastic
- New firms enter until the monopoly profit becomes zero
-  Similar to perfect competition, but fewer firms due to internal economies of scale
Long-run Monopolistic Competition in Autarky
- Final demand curve is d 1
- Marginal revenue equals marginal cost, $\mathrm{mr}_1=$ MC
 - Each firm produces quantity, Q 1
 - Price is PA
 - Long run equilibrium at A, where d is tangent to AC
 -  $\mathbb{P}^\mathrm{A}$ equals Ac
- If all firms charge identical price, each faces demand curve D/NA

##  Equilibrium under Free Trade

##
 - Two countries - Home and Foreign
- Assume: Each country identical in terms of:
- Number of consumers
 - Number of firms, factor endowments and technology
 - Cost curves
 - Tastes
- Increasing [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) to scale provide reason for [international trade](../International%20Finance/Globalization/Chapter%202-The%20Principle%20Of%20Comparative%20Advantage.md)
- Otherwise, trade relative prices will be identical : Identical technologies . Identical factor endowments

###  Short-run Monopolistic Competition with Trade
 ![500](Attachments/500-528.jpg)
Short-run Monopolistic Competition with Trade
- Start with long-run equilibrium without trade, point A
- Allow trade between Home and Foreign
- Number of consumers and firms double
- Demand facing each firm same as before
- Number of product variations double
 -  Consumer demand becomes more elastic, firm demand curve flattens, now d 2
- Price decrease by one firm to $\mathbb{P}_2$ allows greater quantity increase than in autarky. Firm sells $\mathbb{Q}_2>\mathbb{Q}_1$
Short-run Monopolistic Competition with Trade
- D 2 no longer tangent to AC
- d 2 creates corresponding flatter marginal revenue curve, mr 2, allowing single firm to maximize profit at $\mathbb{Q}_2$ and price P 2
- Incentive for all firms to lower prices to P 2 since no monopoly profits available at $\mathbb{P}^\mathrm{A}$
- Firm lowering prices first continues to earn monopoly profits until other firms lower prices
Short-run Monopolistic Competition with Trade
- Other firms lower price to P 2
- Demand curve shifts to D/NA, not d 2
- Each firm sells quantity Q 2' at price P 2
- At Q 2' each firm is selling below its average cost
- Now each firm losing money
 -  Some firms will go bankrupt or consolidate, reducing the total number of firms
- Reduced number of firms increases demand for each firm and reduces product options

##  Long-run Monopolistic Competition with Trade.
 ![500](Attachments/500-530.jpg)
Long-run Monopolistic Competition with Trade.
- Number of firms in each country after trade is opened, NT < NA due to some firms exiting
- Therefore D/NT > D/NA, remaining firms each sell more products
- Long-run equilibrium along d 3
- D 3 tangent to AC at point C
 -  Monopoly profits eliminated
- Equilibrium point C
- Products sell at world price, $P^{W}$
 -  New marginal revenue curve, mr 3 equals MC
Comparison of Long-run versus Short-run Equilibrium.
- Global number of products sold 2 NT > NA
- D 3 more elastic than d 1
- Large number of imported products increases consumer [price sensitivity](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%204/Duration.md)
 -  At C remaining firms charge lower price than in autarky, $\mathbb{P}^{\mathrm{W}}<\mathbb{P}^{\mathrm{A}}$ and produce larger quantity, $\mathbb{Q}_3>\mathbb{Q}_1$
- Consumers gain from lower prices reflecting increasing [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) to scale and increased product variety
- Adjustment Costs: workers in closed firms must find alternative employment and substantial capital destruction

###  Intra-industry Trade
- Monopolistic Competition leads to a very different outcome than simple versions of the Ricardian or Heckscher-Ohlin models
- Many countries specialize in producing different versions of the same good - those goods trade in both directions
- Example: Automobiles
OKnown as Intra-industry Trade

Data frnm: I S Internationol Tende Commissinn loternctive Tariffand Trnde DatoWeh at datowehesitc oo
- Goods with high indices of intra-industry trade have to be differentiated and for costs to be similar between countries

##  The Gravity Model
: Originally had little theoretical underpinnings
- James Anderson and others provided support based on the idea that there would be desire to buy products from (all) nations
 - The Armington hypothesis - differentiated products
- The gravity equation
(GDP 1 - GDP 2) Trade = B ,where B is a constant, distn
GDP; is the gross domestic product of country i and dist is the distance between two countries to the nth power. B represents a summary of all other factors.

##  Application of the Gravity Model
- $B$ includes tariffs, transportation costs, differences in tastes and the effects of border, [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) and income differences
- A version of this model was used in the Estevadeoral, Frantz and Taylor article presented in the first lecture to look at the reasons for the growth and decline in trade from 1870 to 1939
- Estevadeoral et al. Found significant "common [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)" effects in addition to transport costs and lesser effects from tariffs and income convergence
Monopolistic Competition and the Gravity Model
- Using the monopolistic competition model, assume:
- Each country produces a differentiated product
- Country 1 has $GDP_1$ and produces a differentiated product
 -  Country 2 has $GDP_2$ and will purchase Country 1's product
 - In large amounts the larger $GDP_2$
 - In less amounts the greater the distance between Countries 1 and 2
- Define Share 2 = GDPw, where GDPw is world GDP
Monopolistic Competition and the Gravity Model
- Transportation costs incurred for exports from Country 1 to Country 2, are represented by distn:
1 (GDPGDP 2) (GDPShare 2) Trade = distn GDPw distn 1 The term (GDPw) represents $B$ in this version
Of the Gravity Equation. This version assumes that trade will be proportional to the relative size of the countries as measured by their GDPs and inversly proportion
To the distance between the two countries.

##  US/Canada Trade 1993
 ![500](Attachments/500-549.jpg)
Application of the Gravity Model - US/Canada Trade
- Text figure shows trade between 10 Canadian provinces and 30 US states, and among the 10 Canadian provinces
·The values of $B$ are 93 for US/Canada trade and 1300 for intraCanadian province trade. This implies:
- Intra-province trade is 14 times cross-border trade
- There are substantial border effects despite relatively low tariffs. Factors not mentioned in the text that may influence this difference include:
 -  Range products provided by Canada is relatively small
 - Products provided by US very competitive globally
North American Free-Trade Agreements
- Trade agreement impact
- Gains as a portion of GDP relatively small
- But generally sustainable or growing
 - Creates a known environment for members
 - Allows for planning
 -  Avoids chaos - Post Brexit UK
- Text example - 2003 NAFTA costs and benefits:
- Consumer price reductions of \$11 billion annually
 -  Adjustment costs -- \$5.4 billion (lost wages)
 - Net gain \$5.6 billion - less than 0.1% of GDP
Movement of Labor and Capital Between Countries II
October 18,2022
Short-run FDl Impact on Wages and Rental Rates
- Capital flows into only manufacturing
- Increased capital raises MPLm and MPLA
 - Relative prices assumed constant
- Wages rise from W to w'
 - Workers move to manufacturing industry
- PPF moves to the right Manufacturing output increases Agricultural output decreases

#   Short-run FDl Impact on Wages and Output
(a) Effect on Labor Allocation and Wage
 ![500](Attachments/500-592.jpg)
 ![500](Attachments/500-585.jpg)

##  Short-run FDl Impact on Rental Rate
- Fewer laborers to farm land - marginal product of land falls
 - Decreases return on land:$$R_T=P_A\cdot MPT_A$$
- Indeterminant [return on capital](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) using:$$R_K=P_M\cdot MPK_M$$
- Offsetting effects
- Incoming capital reduces marginal [return on capital](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md)
 - Attracts labor increasing marginal [return on capital](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md)

##  Short-run FDl Impact on Rental Rate
- To resolve effect on $R_{K}$ , examine revenue less wages
- If wages increase, [return on capital](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) must decrease ·All else equal
- Wages remain constant only if:
- Lm/Km constant
 -  $\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{K}}$ constant as well
- Real wages must increase to compensate workers for their increased productivity decreasing [return on capital](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) in the short-run

##   Short-run FDl Impact on Rental Rate
 ![500](Attachments/500-595.jpg)

##  Long Run Labor Allocation and Output
- Assume Heckscher-Ohlin world, except:
- Labor fixed in each country - no migration
- Capital allowed to move between countries and may move between sectors
. Computer manufacture capital intensive$$\frac{L_S}{K_S}>\frac{L_C}{K_C}\text{ equivalently,}\frac{K_C}{L_C}>\frac{K_S}{L_S}$$$L_C+L_S=\bar{L},K$ increases from K toK'

(a) Effect on the Allocation of Labor and Capital
 ![500](Attachments/500-618.jpg)
(b) Effect on Industry Outputs
 ![500](Attachments/500-583.jpg)

###  Labor Allocation and Output$$Recall\frac{0_CK}{0_CL}>\frac{0_SK}{0_SL}$$
FDI provides more capital per worker in computer industry. This increase in capital shifts origin from $0_C$ to $0_C^{\prime}$ Since constant for oth industrie, allocation of labor moves from $L$ to $L^{\prime}$ and of capital from K to K'

##  Labor Allocation and Output
- An increase in foreign direct [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), $\Delta K$ , leads to additional domestic capital allocation equal to $K^{\prime}-K$ and to labor allocation equal to $L^{\prime}-L$
- Each industry maintains its original, optimal labor to capital ratio
- Effect on output is in accordance with Rybczynski's theorem
- Capital-intensive industry increases output
- Labor-intensive industry decreases output

##  Rental Rates and Wages in Singapore
- Singapore long encouraged inward-bound FDI
- Part A: create nationwide production function
- Capital-labor ratio grew 5% annually - 1970 to 1990
- Marginal product of
- Capital fell 3.4%
 -  Labor grew 1.6%
- Consistent with short-run specific-factors model
 -  Rents fell
 - Wages rose

##  Rental Rates and Wages in Singapore
- Part B: calculate rental rate on capital equipment
- Compute [expected return](../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) on capital (rental rate)$P_K\cdot (i+d)$ , where $P_K$ is price of equipment, i is the interestrate and $d$ is the real depreciation, the real rental rate is,$$\frac RP=\frac{P_K}P\cdot (i+d)$$
- Capital will not remain in a low return business
- This method shows no evidence of declining rental rates

##  Rental Rates and Wages in Singapore
- What is going on?
 -  According to calculations in Part B:
 - Real wages grow
 - Implies labor productivity growth
 - Which one is correct?
 - Will return to this story at end of the quarter

##  Gains from Migration and FDI
- Despite advantages, most countries:
- Impose some limits on FDI
- Substantial limits on immigration
- Penalties on employers of illegal immigrants
 -  Fear of public “safety net" costs
- In theory, both country of immigration and emigration benefit, as well as both the country providing and receiving FDl
- Net benefits often small, have distributional consequences and come with risks
Gains from Migration
 ![500](Attachments/500-587.jpg)

##  Gains from Migration
- Use specific-factors model
- Pre-migration
- Home $\bar{L}$ workers
 -  Foreign $\overline{L}^*$ workers
 -  Foreign has more workers than Home
- Allow workers to migrate from Foreign to Home
- Home worker wages decline from W to w'
 - Foreign worker wages rise from w*to w'
 -  Equilibrium at B

#  Gains from Migration
- All workers paid W' in equilibrium
- Gains for Home
- All workers except the last create marginal product > W'
 - Domestic workers paid less than previously
- Gains for Foreign
- Workers who leave paid more than marginal product
 - Remaining workers' pay rises due to increased MPL

##  World Gains
- ABA* represents global welfare gain$$=\frac{1}{2}\cdot (W-W^*)\cdot (L'-L), representswo$$
Increase in GDP
- Gains go to different groups in each country
- Distribution often a political issue
 -  Point B - equilibrium with full employment
 - Reached only in the long run

##  Gains From Immigration 1
- George Borjas' assessment of models of immigration:
- The elasticity of labor with regard to wages does not come from empirical research
- Derived from assumption of Cobb-Douglas production function with following inputs:
- Labor income is 70% of national income. This forces the elasticity of wages to be -. 3
 -  Immigrants 15% of labor force
 -  Conclusion based on these assumptions: immigration surplus increases GDP by 0.25%
George Borjas' Assessment of Immigration Models
- Updating his US study's numbers, if wage elasticity is -. 3:
-  Native-born workers lose approximately 2.7% of GDP
 - Negative $402 billion
- Native-owned capital gains approximately 2.9% of GDP
 - Positive $437 billion
 - Net $35 billion gain in a $15 trillion US economy
- "Put bluntly, there is actually very little data underneath the socalled estimates of the economic benefits from immigration."2

##  Gains from Foreign Direct Investment
- Use specific-factors model
- Pre-Foreign Direct [Investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)
·Home $\overline{K}$ capital - Foreign K*capital
 -  Foreign has less capital than Home
 - Allow foreign direct [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) from Home to Foreign
- Home rental rate increases from R to R'
 - Foreign rental rate declines from R*to R'
 -  Equilibrium at B

##  Gains from Foreign Direct Investment
- All capital earns R' in equilibrium
- Gains for Home
- FDl earns increased R' on all capital ≥ MPK
- Workers' pay falls due to decreased MPL
- Gains for Foreign
- FDl increases MPL of Foreign workers; lowers MPK
 - Workers' pay rises due to increased MPL

##  Phantom FDI 3
- Damgaard, Elkjaer, and Johannesen argue in a forthcoming paper:
- "Phantom" FDl now constitutes 38% of the total
- Driven by tax advantages and use of financial engineering
- Movement of intellectual property to minimize global taxes
- Distorts GDP statistics - Ireland's 26% growth in 2015

##  Immiserizing Growth 4
- Having discussed benefits of [international trade](../International%20Finance/Globalization/Chapter%202-The%20Principle%20Of%20Comparative%20Advantage.md), immigration and [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)
- Once important caveat: Immiserizing Growth
- Economic growth that reduces a country's welfare
- Links terms of trade and growth

##  Immiserizing Growth
 ![500](Attachments/500-584.jpg)
Figure 11.1

##  Immiserizing Growth
- Two goods: Y 1, principally export; y 2, principally import
 - Initial production point B and consumption point C
 - Country grows, by increasing exports and PPF shifts left
 - New production point B', consumption at C'
 - If accompanied by a reduction in terms of trade
- Consumption falls to C" and production to B"
- Further fall in terms of trade: worse off than autarky

##  Immiserizing Growth
- Conditions for immiserizing growth - Bhagwati (1958)
- Foreign demand for imports is inelastic or
- Growth reduces output of the importable good at constant relative price level
- Inelastic demand by foreign country for imports
- Steep demand curve implies:
- Reduction in prices to grow demand will reduce total revenues
 -  Farmers lose money with a "bumper" crop

##  Immiserizing Growth
- Growth reduces output of the importable good
- Rate of exportable output exceeds the rate of technological change
- Continued growth raises factor prices
 -  Exportable industry attracts resources from economy
- Importable good demand must shrink
- Rybczynski-like effect
- Important implications in emerging economies and wealth distribution

Movement of Labor and Capital Between Countries I
October 13,2022

##  Migration and Capital Investment
- Impact on wages
- Begin with Specific Factors model - short-run consequences
 - Subsequently Heckscher-Ohlin model - long-run consequences
 -  Turn to Foreign Direct [Investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) (FDI)
 - Capital movement across countries
 - Gains and losses due to migration and FDl

###  Short-run Effects.
- Two sectors Manufacturing and Agriculture
- Single labor pool:$$L_A+L_M=\bar{L}$$
- Wages in each sector:$$W=P_A\cdot MPL_A\\W=P_M\cdot MPL_M$$
- Equilibrium occurs when W is the same in both sectors

#  No-trade Home Market Labor Equilibrium
 ![500](Attachments/500-583.jpg)
Introduce Foreign Country - Short Term Model
- Foreign wage is W* < W
- Assume Home allows immigration of workers from Foreign
- Labor force increases: $\bar{L}^{\prime}=\bar{L}+\Delta L$ , where △L is the number of immigrant laborers
 -  This shifts the $P_A\cdot MPL_A$ curve to the right resulting in a new, lower equilibrium wage rate, W'
 - Equilibrium moves from point A to B

##  Increase in Home Labor due to Immigration
 ![500](Attachments/500-583.jpg)

##  Short-term Outcomes
- Labor usage increases in both sectors
 - Wages decline for all workers
 - Views of capital-owners versus domestic unions
 - Short-run both industries' output rises
 - Labor increase does not affect world relative prices

##  Long-run Effects of Immigration
- Assume Heckscher-Ohlin world, except:
- Allow labor to move between countries
- Capital remains fixed in each country
- Shoe manufacturing labor intensive; computer manufacturing capital intensive$$\frac{L_S}{K_S}>\frac{L_C}{K_C}\text{ equivalently,}\frac{K_C}{L_C}>\frac{K_S}{L_S}$$$$K_C+K_S=\overline{K}\mathrm{~and~}L_C+L_S=\overline{L}$$

Long-run Effects of Immigration
 ![500](Attachments/500-586.jpg)
Labor Increase at Home
Impact on Wages, Rentals and Output
- Real wage and rental rate determined by marginal products
 - Home's higher K/L implies lower MPK and rental rate and greater MPL and wage rate compared with Foreign
- Add immigrant labor to the Home economy, $\bar{L}^{\prime}=\bar{L}+\Delta L$
- Lengthens the labor axis by △L
- Labor is not allocated to both sectors as it was with specific-factors model
Labor Increase at Home
Impact on Wages, Rentals and Output
- Outputs adjust to allocate incremental labor to labor intensive industry (shoes)
- Capital-labor ratios constant
 - Labor and capital leave computer industry
- Workers - same amount of capital as prior to immigration
- Additional labor fully employed
- Capital-labor ratios unchanged in each industry

###  Labor Increase at Home
Impact on Wages, Rentals and Output
- W/r remains the same
- No change in marginal productivities - unlike short-term
- Factors of production available increase for shoes - decrease for computers
- Shoe output increases
- Computer output decreases
- Relative prices remain constant

###  Labor Increase at Home - Impact on Wages and Rentals
 ![500](Attachments/500-583.jpg)

##  Rybczynski Theorem
- In the long-run, an increase in one factor results in the country increasing output in the industry using that factor intensively and decreasing output of the other industry
- Under assumptions of Heckscher-Ohlin model
 - Holds for any factor
- Results in Factor Price Insensitivity theorem
- Factor prices unchanged as economy shifts output to industry utilizing increased factor intensively

##  Rybczynski Theorem - Home Viewpoint
 ![500](Attachments/500-580.jpg)

##  Mariel Boat Lift - 1980
- Brought low-skilled Cuban refugees to Miami
- 125,000 immigrants came from May through September 1980
- Increased labor force 7%; 50% settled permanently
 - Represented larger impact on low-skilled labor market
- David Card (1990) study - natural experiment
- No long-term impact on wages in the region
 - No discernable impact on unemployment rate

##  Mariel Boat Lift Impact
- Rybczynski theorem predicts that in the Miami area:
- Low-skill labor industries will expand
- High-skill labor industries will contract
- Real value-added in apparel industry increases after lift - remains above trend in Miami for well over a decade after the Miami boat lift
- Real value-added by skilled workers in skill intensive industries declines after lift and remains below trend
Value- added by Worker Type
 ![500](Attachments/500-581.jpg)

##  Mariel Boat Lift Impact
- Competing hypothesis for no relative decline in low-skill wages
- "Skill-based technological change".
- Computers adopted more slowly in Miami than US overall
- Firms may have employed low-skill workers longer in place of computers
 - Only 20% of Mariel immigrants in manufacturing
. Skill-based technology change inconclusive here

##  Immigration and Us Wages
- The number of foreign-born people doubled in the US between 1980 and 2005 to 13%
- Relative impact on wages a function of
- Whether the immigrants were competitive with or complementary to domestic workers
 - There was a change in availability of capital in a given industry or position
- Competition appears greatest at lowest end of educational spectrum

1. Short-run model fixes capital and land
 2. Long-run model allows for capital to adjust

##  Immigration and Wages
·Part A:
- Long-run adjustments maintain:
- Capital/labor ratio
 -  Real wage to rental ratio
- Assumes US and foreign workers are perfect substitutes
·Part B:
- Assumes foreign workers are imperfect substitutes
- Principally compete with other foreign workers
Impact of Immigration and Wages on Output
- Short-run, both industries:
- Employ more workers relative to capital
-  Increase output
: Specific-factors model applies
Impact of Immigration and Wages on Output
- Long-run, both industries
- Maintain previous L/K
- Output of one industry increases
- Output of second industry decreases
- HoV model applies

##  Foreign Direct Investment
·Two types:
- Horizontal - purchase of a company in one country by a company based in another
- Vertical - creation or purchase of a plant or other capabilities in one country by a company based in another
- Greenfield versus Brownfield - new versus existing
- Represents an increase in capital in the country receiving FDl
- Traditionally from high-wage to low-wage countries

FIGURE 10. TRADE WITH No-FPE, GRAVITY DEMAND SPECIFICATION, AND ADJUSTED ROW (T 7)

##  Davis and Weinstein
. Begin with Heckscher-Ohlin assumptions.
- Increasingly relax assumptions.
- Achieve good fit versus observed trade data
- Data from 10 OECD countries
- Covers 34 industries
- Relatively new data set at the time,
 - Provided reasonably consistent data on technology, output, endowments, absorption and trade

###  Davis and Weinstein
·Standard HOV model
- Assumptions
- Number of tradable goods $\geq$ Number of factors
 -  Perfectly competitive markets Factor distribution consistent with equilibrium
 -  Free Trade
- Adjusted FPE implies labor to capital ratios are fixed for each industry
 - Trade
 -  Factor input requirements Factor endowments

##  Davis and Weinstein
- Differing endowments - tradable goods specialization based on relative factor endowments
-  Non-tradable goods produced with different factor proportions
 - If utilize industry factor proportions results in understatement of traded goods factor proportions
- Exports of capital abundant countries typically:
- Exhibit greater capital intensity than total production
 - Utilize higher wage employees in capital services

##  Davis and Weinstein
- Exports of labor abundant countries
- Labor usage less than predicted
 Averages-in domestic production of non-tradable goods
 - Globally inexpensive labor irrelevant for domestic production
- Results in apparent lower labor importation from labor intensive countries by the importing country
- Need to break out different labor to capital ratios for export products versus non-tradable goods.

#  Davis and Weinstein Technology

FIGURE 2. TRADE WITH COMMON TECHNOLOGY (US) (T 1)
 ![500](Attachments/500-584.jpg)
FIGURE 3. PRODUCTION WITH COMMON TECHNOLOGY (AVERAGE) (P 2)

##  Davis and Weinstein
- No Price Factor Equalization (No-FPE) accounts for substantial endowment differences by country
- Places countries in different cones of production for tradable goods
 - FPEbreaks down
 - Non-tradable goods produced with different factor input ratios
- Trade frictions - difficulty with direct measurement
-  Gravity based demand specification based on distance

###  Davis and Weinstein
·Adjusted Rest of World (ROW)
- Original assumption - ROW technology projected from OECD data onto ROW endowments
- Likelihood of substantial error - ROW predicted to be a much larger trader in both capital than labor than observed
- Adjusted Row forces technology to match endowments and outputs

##  Lerner Diagram 2
 ![500](Attachments/500-586.jpg)
Figure 1.13

##  Learner Diagram
- Lerner diagrams define the range of industries in which a country may be competitive
- This dependent on the relative endowments of capital and labor
- Assume perfect competition, constant [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) to scale
- Revenue = Cost
- Choose an isoquant, s.t., each industry revenue = 1
 - Therefore $p_iy_i=1$

##  Learner Diagram
- Looking at the national production function:$Y=f_{i}(L_{i}, K_{i})=1/p_{i}\implies wL_{i}+rK_{i}=1$
i.e., the value $of$ labor and capital equals revenue We can determine factor prices where$$L_i=0\Longrightarrow K_i=1/r, and\:K_i=0\Longrightarrow L_i=$$
- This demonstrates that factor prices are insensitive to endowments
- Creates a “cone" of industries in which a country may be competitive
- Proves the "factor price insensitivity" lemma

Inter-National Specialization
Figure l: Inter- and Intra-National Specialization in a Multiple Cone Equilibrium
Trade between Developed and Developing Countries
. Heckscher-Ohlin makes predictions regarding:.
- Relative proportion of high skilled labor growth
 - Export prices received versus per capita GDP
 -  As exports grow and become more sophisticated
- Production outside cone results in negative profits
- Drives out industries outside of cone
- Implies little or no overlap between goods and services for countries in different cones

#  Schott China Study
- Product-level data used to decompose exports from China
- China cannot be viewed as a single entity
- Shanghai - well-educated, well paid labor base
 - Guizhou - low paid, relatively uneducated labor base
- This data explains how and why China:
- Produces increasingly technologically and capital-intensive products
 - Competes with OECD nations, despite relative labor abundance

##  China's Export Mix and Pricing
- Schott provides regression results demonstrating:
- All countries show a statistically significant positive relationship among export prices, per capita GDP and skilled labor abundance
- Chinese products sell at a significant discount to other countries in terms of per capita GDP and skilled labor abundance

##  Trade Effects on Factor Prices
- Examine relative changes in wages and rental rates
- Subject to a change in relative prices
- Change in wage to rental ratio determines relative demand of labor and capital
 - Change in labor to capital ratio in each industry determines relative supply by each industry
- Fixed amounts of capital and labor in each country:$$\bar{L}=L_C+L_s\mathrm{~and~}\bar{K}=K_C+K_s$$

##  Equilibrium Conditions
- Equilibrium for relative wage level is determined by:$$\frac{\bar{L}}{\bar{K}}=\frac{(L_C+L_S)}{\bar{K}}=\frac{L_C}{K_C}\cdot\frac{K_C}{\bar{K}}+\frac{L_S}{K_S}\cdot\frac{K_S}{\bar{K}}$$
Relative Supply = Relative Demand$$Subjectto:\frac{K_C}{\bar{K}}+\frac{K_S}{\bar{K}}=1$$
Home Wage to Rental Ratio
 ![500](Attachments/500-552.jpg)

##  Home Wage to Rental Ratio
- Economy-wide relative demand curve a weighted average of Lc/Kc and Ls/Ks, where the weights are each industry's output
- Economy-wide relative supply of labor to capital is fixed
- Single W/R since workers and capital may move between industries
 - When W/R changes, both industries want to adjust labor to capital ratio

#  Impact of Computer Price Increase
 ![500](Attachments/500-580.jpg)

##  Impact of Computer Price Increase
- Trade introduced, Pc/Ps increases
- Production shifts from A to B
 - Computer production increases from Qci to Qc 2
 - Demand for labor shifts: $\frac{K_C}{\bar{K}}$ K# $\frac{K_C}{\bar{K}}\uparrow\frac{K_S}{\bar{K}}\downarrow$
- Shifts relative demand curve from RD 1 to RD 2
- Relative wages fall from (W/R) 1 to (W/R) 2
- Both industries hire more labor relative to capital

###  Relative Computer Price Increase Effect on Wage/Rental
 ![500](Attachments/500-584.jpg)

##  Increase in L/K
- How can both industries increase relative labor deployed?$$\frac{\bar{L}}{\bar{K}}=\frac{(L_C+L_S)}{\bar{K}}=\frac{L_C}{K_C}\uparrow\cdot\frac{K_C}{\bar{K}}\uparrow+\frac{L_S}{K_S}\uparrow\cdot\frac{K_S}{\bar{K}}\downarrow $$
- Labor is relatively less expensive, both industries utilize relatively more
 Relatively lower marginal productivity implies. Relatively lower wage rate
 - Labor released from shoe manufacturing equals labor acquired by capital-intensive computer manufacturing
 - Relatively less labor is released by the shoe industry than $\mathcal{L}_s/\mathcal{K}_s$ prior to the change in $\mathbb{P}_c/\mathbb{P}_s$
Increase in L/K: Real Wage and Rental Rate Impact
- Reliant on assumption:$$\frac{L_C}{K_C}<\frac{L_S}{K_S}$$
·Winners and Losers
- Marginal Product of Capital increases: more labor per unit $of$ capital,$$R=P_C\cdot MP\dot{K_C}$$
And $R=P_S\cdot MPK_S$
Theref ore with. $R$ equalized once capital has moved,$$MPK_C=\frac R{P_C}\uparrow\: and\:MPK_S=\frac R{P_S}\uparrow $$
- Real [return on capital](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) increases in both industries
Increase in L/K: Real Wage and Rental Rate Impact
- Relative price increase increases return of intensively used factor - Capital in this example
- Conversely, Marginal Product of Labor declines$$W=P_C\cdot MPL_C\mathrm{~and~}W=P_S\cdot MPL_S,$$
Therefore with W equalized once labor has moved,$$MPL_C=\frac W{P_C}\downarrow\mathrm{~}and\mathrm{~}MPL_S=\frac W{P_S}\downarrow $$
- Real wages decrease in both industries

###  Stolper-Samuelson Theorem
- "In the long run, when all factors are mobile, an increase in the relative price of a good will increase the real earnings of the factor used intensely in the production of that good and decrease the real earnings of the other factor."5

##  Example
- Home has 50 units of labor and 20 units of capital$$\frac{L_S}{K_S}=\frac 31\: and\:\frac{L_C}{K_C}=\frac 21.\: Initially,$$
30 units of labor and 10 of capital in the shoe industry and 20 units of labor and 10 of capital in the computer industry
- Relative increase in price of computers relative to shoes
- Leads to computer industry growth, making capital relatively more valuable than labor
 -  w/r declines, shoe industry sheds labor at a lower rate than 3 to 1, say, 2.5 to 1. Why?
 -  Since K/L constant for the economy, capital and labor shed by shoe industry must all go to computer industry

###  Example
- For example, 5 units of labor and 2 of capital move from Shoe to Computer industry$$\begin{gathered}
\frac{L_S}{K_S}=\frac{25}{8}=\frac{3.13}{1}\: and\:\frac{L_C}{K_C}=\frac{25}{12}=\frac{2.08}{1}, \\
\text{economy wide remains at}\frac{50}{20}=\frac{2.5}{1}
\end{gathered}$$
Weights of capital in each industry have shifted as follows:$$\begin{gathered}
\text{Lapicai in eacin inuusti y ilave simiteu as ionio} \\
\frac{20}{10}\times\frac{10}{20}+\frac{30}{10}\times\frac{10}{20}\: to\:\frac{50}{20}=\frac{25}{12}\times\frac{12}{20}+\frac{25}{8} \\
\text{ipital allocation from}\frac{50}{50}to\:\frac{60}{40}\: toward \\

Long-run Change in Factor Prices - Heckscher-Ohlin
- Capital mobility has different consequences for factor price changes when the relative price of goods changes:$$\frac{\Delta W}W<0<\frac{\Delta P_C}{P_C}<\frac{\Delta R}R, for\text{ an increase i}$$
Ein $P_C$$$\frac{\Delta R}{R}<\frac{\Delta P_{C}}{P_{C}}<0<\frac{\Delta W}{W}, for\: a\: decrease\:in$$$$\frac{\Delta R}R<0<\frac{\Delta P_S}{P_S}<\frac{\Delta W}W, for\text{ an increase i}$$
Ein $P_S$
Specific-factors Model Change in Factor Prices
- The following equations summarize the relationship among factor prices when the relative price of goods changes:
For$$\text{ease in P}_M,\frac{\Delta R_T}{R_T}<0<\frac{\Delta W}W<\frac{\Delta P_M}{P_M}<\frac{\Delta R}{R_K}$$$$e\: in\: P_M,\frac{\Delta R_K}{R_K}<\frac{\Delta P_M}{P_M}<\frac{\Delta W}{W}<0<\frac{\Delta R_T}{R_T}$$$$ase\: in\: P_{A},\frac{\Delta R_{K}}{R_{K}}<0<\frac{\Delta W}{W}<\frac{\Delta P_{A}}{P_{A}}<\frac{\Delta R_{T}}{R_{T}}$$

##  Comparison with Specific-factors Model.
. Short-term, Specific-factors Model assumptions hold
- Specific factor in the importing industry losses
 - Specific factor in the exporting industry gains
- H-O assumptions hold long-run: production factors
- Used intensively in exports benefit
 - Used intensively in imports lose
- US: abundant high-skilled workers; scarce low-skilled

Heckscher-Ohlin I
October 6,2022

##  Heckscher-Ohlin Theory (Factor-Proportions Theory)
- Expands on Ricardian and Specific-factors models
- Introduces mobile capital factors of production
- Capital factors may move to other sectors in the long-run
- Capital may be substituted for labor and labor for capital
- Labor competes against capital in addition to utilizing it
- Once real-world adjustments made, fits data well

#  Heckscher-Ohlin Theory
- Comparative advantage influenced by
- Relative abundance of factors
 - Technology choice
- Comparative advantage in these drives [international trade](../International%20Finance/Globalization/Chapter%202-The%20Principle%20Of%20Comparative%20Advantage.md)
- Intensity of factor use
- Focus on Labor versus Capital
 - Control rate of MPL decline

##  History of Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem
- Theory developed between 1919 and 1924
- End of long period of substantial [international trade](../International%20Finance/Globalization/Chapter%202-The%20Principle%20Of%20Comparative%20Advantage.md) growth
. Dramatic improvements in transportation, "mobilizing" capital goods
 - Capability to move large machines within country/internationally
- Evened out technology differences between countries

##  Origins of Heckscher-Ohlin Model
- Debate between Heckscher and Knut Wicksell
- Wicksell influenced by Malthus and concerns about economic equity
 - Heckscher focused on the effects of relative abundance of factors of production
- Mass emigration from Sweden to US 1871 to 1890 due to:
- Abundance of labor and scarcity of productive land and limited manufacturing led to 44% population decrease

##  Origins of Heckscher-Ohlin Model
- During 1918-1920 Wicksell and Heckscher corresponded on the impact of increasing wood prices on Swedish labor
- Wicksell believed would lead to another wave of emigration
- Limited number of wealthy owners of forests who would choose to export raw lumber leading to labor emigration
- Heckscher argued immigration into Sweden would follow
- Real wages would fall as wood prices rose
 -  Sweden equipped with scarce resource (charcoal) - globally abundant labor would immigrate

##  Heckscher-Ohlin Assumptions
- Two by two by two model
- Factors:
 - Labor
 -  Capital
- Industries:
 - Shoes
 -  Computers
- Countries:
 - Home
 -  Foreign

##  Heckscher-Ohlin Assumptions
. Factor Endowments:
- Home:$$\bar{K}=K_S+K_C\\\bar{L}=L_S+L_C$$
- Foreign:$$\bar{K}^*=\:K_S^*+K_C^*\\\bar{L}^*=\:L_S^*+L_C^*$$
- Total capital and labor are fixed within each country
- But both move freely between industries within that country

##  Heckscher-Ohlin Assumptions
- By assumption:
- Shoe production labor intensive - computer production capital intensive$$\frac{L_S}{K_S}>\frac{L_C}{K_C}$$
- Home is Capital abundant - Foreign is labor abundant$$\frac{\bar{L}^*}{\bar{K}^*}>\frac{\bar{L}}{\bar{K}}$$

##  Labor-Capital Relative Demand versus Wage/Rental
 ![500](Attachments/500-583.jpg)

#  Heckscher-Ohlin Assumptions.
- Only final outputs freely tradeable between countries
- Labor and capital cannot move between countries
- Technologies are identical in both countries
- Opposite of Ricardian assumption
 - Needs to be relaxed to fit real-world data
- Consumer tastes are identical in both countries

###  No-trade Equilibria
 ![500](Attachments/500-585.jpg)

#  No-trade Equilibria
- Take PPF shape as an assumption for now - will prove later
 -  Given identical tastes
- Relative prices determine consumption in each country
 - Relative endowments determine production quantities
 - Slope of relative price curve shallower for Home
- Computers less expensive relative to shoes
- Relative prices would be identical if endowments identical

##  Home Gains From Trade
 ![500](Attachments/500-584.jpg)

###  Home Gains From Trade
- Home consumes at point on world relative price line where trade with Foreign is balanced
- Assured by identical tastes at Home and Foreign
- At point C, Home:
- Exports $Q_{C 2}-Q_{C 3}$ computers Imports $Q_{S 3}-Q_{S 2}$ shoes
- The relative price of computers increases from:$$\left (\frac{P_C}{P_S}\right)^A\mathrm{to}\left (\frac{P_C}{P_S}\right)^W$$

##   Foreign Gains From Trade
 ![500](Attachments/500-581.jpg)

###  Foreign Gains From Trade
- Foreign consumes at point on world relative price line where trade with Home is balanced
- Assured by identical tastes at Home and Foreign
- At point C*, Foreign:
 Imports $Q_{C 3}^*-Q_{C 2}^*$ computers Exports $Q_{S 2}^*-Q_{S 3}^*$ shoes
- The relative price of computers decreases from:$$\left (\frac{P_C}{P_S}\right)^{A^*}\mathrm{to}\left (\frac{P_C}{P_S}\right)^W$$

##  World Equilibrium
 ![500](Attachments/500-557.jpg)

##  World Equilibrium
- Reach equilibrium when:
- Relative price of computers Home exports reaches the relative price where Foreign is willing it import such that,$$Q_{C 2}-Q_{C 3}=Q_{C 3}^*-Q_{C 2}^*$$
- Free-trade equilibrium
- Since no borrowing or lending is allowed, therefore,$$Q_{S 2}^*-Q_{S 3}^*=Q_{S 3}-Q_{S 2}$$

###  Pattern of Trade
. Given restrictive assumptions:
- Relative factor endowments determine the pattern of trade between Home and Foreign
- Each country exports the abundant factor available in its economy
 - Home - capital
 -  Foreign - labor
- These are the fundamental insights of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem
Real-world Analysis - Heckscher-Ohlin Assumptions
- Labor and capital flow freely between industries
- Production of one good labor intensive; other capital intensive
- One country labor abundant; other capital abundant
- Free trade in international goods
. Technologies identical across countries.
- Identical tastes across countries
- No borrowing or lending allowed

##  Leontief Paradox (1953)
- Leontief's study of post wwll American exports and imports
 - Despite substantial comparative advantage in terms of capital
- US exported products with a significant labor component
 - Capital to labor ratio lower for US exports than US imports in 1947 - assumed foreign firms used US technology
 - Contradicted predictions of the Heckscher-Ohlin model
Leontief's Findings 1$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & Exports & Imports \\
Capital (5 millions) & 2.55 & 3.1 \\
Labor (person-years) & 182 & 170 \\
Apital/labor (S/person) & 14,000 & 18,200 \\
\hline
\end{array}$$

Reprinted in Richard Caves and Harry G. Johnson, eds., 1968, Readings in International Economics (Homewood, IL: Irwin).

#
 - US exported labor and imported capital
- US exports substantially exceeded imports during this period
Potential Explanations for the Leontief Paradox
- Leontief ignores abundance of land as a factor of production
- US technologies and those of foreign importers differ
 - No distinction between
 - High-skilled and low-skilled labor
 - US exporting highly skilled labor?
 - Distortions due to 1947 - two years after the end of wwll
 - US not actively engaged in free trade
Leamer (1980) Reformulation of Leontief Test 2
- Leamer used an extension of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem developed by Jaroslav Vanek (known as Hov)
- HoV states the following:
- If a country's endowment of a factor relative to the world endowment of that factor exceeds the country's share of world GDP, the country is abundant in that factor
- Relies on the assumptions that all tastes are identical and homothetic which implies that relative consumption is proportional to GDP

##  Leamer (1980) Reformulation of Leontief Test 3
- Leamer demonstrated that HoV implied, if country i were capital abundant, for example, the production capital/labor ratio exceeded that for consumption:$$\frac{K^i}{L^i}>\frac{K^i-F_k^i}{L^i-F_l^i},$$
Where $F_k^i$ and $F_l^i$ are the factor contents of trade$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & Economy-wide Production & Domestic Consumptior \\
Capital (SBillions) & 5327 & 5305 \\
Labor (Person-years) & 47 million & 45 million \\
Canital/labor ( (S/person) & 56,949 & 56,737 \\
\hline
\end{array}$$

##  Bowen, Leamer and Sveikauskas (1987)
- Replicated Leamer (1980) methodology on 27 countries
- H-O hypothesis describes "relation among three separately observable phenomena":
 - Trade
 -  Factor input requirements
 -  Factor endowments
- Again looked at Trade = Production less Consumption.$$\frac{K^i}{L^i}>\frac{K^i-F_k^i}{L^i-F_l^i}$$
. Statistically insignificant regarding Leontief's prediction -- missing element: factor-price equalization

##  Factor Endowments 2017 (Percentage of Global Endowment)
 ![500](Attachments/500-616.jpg)

##  Factor Endowments 2017
- Unadjusted for:
OGDP
- Qualitative differences.
 Labor skill/productivity differences
 - Arable land productivity
- Leads to "effective" factor endowment
- Accounts for productivity differences
- Consider endowment as share of GDP - domestic absorption

##  US Effective Factor Endowments 2017 (Percentage of Global Endowment).
 ![500](Attachments/500-617.jpg)

##  Effective Factor Endowments 2017
- Effective factor endowment:
- = actual factor endowment X measure of productivity
- May be direct or indirect, e.g., capital spending per person
- Comparing effective factor endowment to global GDP share determines
- Whether the effective factor endowment is scarce or abundant
- Many more adjustments required to fit real world

 ![500](Attachments/500-615.jpg)
Specific-Factors Model
October 4, 2022

##  Specific-Factors Model
- Under Ricardian model all workers gained from trade
- Earnings of other factors were not considered
- Specific (fixed) factors model examines productivity and [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) of specific-factors in addition to labor
- Specific-factors not allowed to move from sector to sector
- Labor still fully mobile between sectors in each country
- We will see this implies diminishing marginal [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) of labor as production in one sector increases
 -  This creates winners and losers in each country

##  Output and Marginal Product of Labor
 ![500](Attachments/500-584.jpg)
Diminishing Marginal Productivity of Labor
- Ricardian model assumed constant marginal productivity of labor
- Considering immobility of specific factors, marginal productivity will decrease.
- Machine shared among 11 workers versus 10
 - 100 acres of farmland worked by three versus two tractors

#   Production Possibilities Frontier
 ![500](Attachments/500-580.jpg)
Effect on Production Possibilities Frontier
- Ricardian model assumed constant marginal productivity of labor
- Under Specific-factor, PPF becomes bow shaped
- Slope at any point = -MPLA/MPLM
- When moving toward increased quantities of manufactures
- $MPL_M$ decreases
 -  $MPL_A$ increases

###  Effect on Production Possibilities Frontier
·As with the Ricardian model:$$W=P_M\times MPL_M=P_A\times MPL_A,$$$$\frac{P_M}{P_A}=\frac{MPL_A}{MPL_M}$$
Or the relative price of manufactured goods to agricultural goods equals the opportunity cost of producing another unit of agricultural goods versus manuf actured goods

##  Gains from Trade
- Foreign no-trade relative price assumed to differ due to differences in:
- Productivity
- Resources: labor, capital, land
- Assume Home no-trade relative price of manufactures is lower than Foreign$$\frac{P_M}{P_A}<\frac{P_M^*}{P_A^*}$$
- Home's comparative advantage in manufacturing. Foreign's in agriculture

###  Increase in Relative Price of Manufactures - Home
Agriculture| output, $Q_A$
 ![500](Attachments/500-620.jpg)
Increase in Relative Price of Manufactures
- Allow for [international trade](../International%20Finance/Globalization/Chapter%202-The%20Principle%20Of%20Comparative%20Advantage.md) between Home and Foreign$$\frac{P_M}{P_A}<\left (\frac{P_M}{P_A}\right)^W<\frac{P_M^*}{P_A^*}$$
- When [international trade](../International%20Finance/Globalization/Chapter%202-The%20Principle%20Of%20Comparative%20Advantage.md) opens, manufactures' prices will:
- Increase relative to agricultural prices for Home
- Decrease relative to agricultural prices for Foreign
- Relative prices converge to the world price line

##  Home Gains from Trade
- Home gains from the steeper relative price curve
- Manufacturing and agricultural quantities produced move from A to B
 - Indifference curve from U to U 2
 - Consumption from A to C
- Home overall gains from trade
- Individual workers and industries may lose

###  Home Labor Earnings$$\bar{L}=L_M+L_A$$
Each industry hires until,$$W=P_M\times MPL_M\: and\:W=P_A\times MPL_A,$$
Labor market equilibrium occurs when labor is allocated
At point A where the two labor demand curves meet.
One can think of the demand for manufacturing labor representing the limiting factor for agricultural labor supply and vice versa
Home Labor Earnings - Autarky
 ![500](Attachments/500-561.jpg)
Increase in Price of Manufactures
- Assume a relative price increase in manufactured goods, △Pm
Consider the effect on real wages,
The wage rate rises from W to W'reflecting the increase, $\Delta P_M\times MPL_M$ ,equilibrium now at $B$$$\Delta W=W^{\prime}-W<\Delta P_M\times MPL_M, Why?$$
Increase in Price of Manufactures-- Home
 ![500](Attachments/500-543.jpg)
Increase in Price of Manufactures
Dividing through by $W = P_m × MPL_m,$
Obtain $$\frac{\Delta W}W<\frac{\Delta P_M\times MPL_M}{P_M\times MPL_M}=\frac{\Delta P_M}{P_M}\\\frac{\Delta W}W\text{ is the elasticity of wages}$$
△PM is the elasticity of the manufactured goods price. PM
Real wages have fallen in terms of manufactured goods. The price of agricultural goods is unchanged, so real wages have increased versus agricultural goods.$$0=\frac{\Delta P_A}{P_A}<\frac{\Delta W}W<\frac{\Delta P_M}{P_M}$$

##  Earnings of Capital and Land
- Zero profit, perfectly competitive firms
- Total payments to labor are:$$W\times L_A+W\times L_M$$
- Two methods to calculate earnings of capital and land:
- Calculate labor payments and deduct from revenues, remainder represents earnings of capital or land
-  Multiply the good's price by the marginal productivity of capital or land

###  Earnings of Capital and Land
- Calculate revenues and deduct payments to labor:
Payments to ca $oital\textit{ owners}= P_{M}\times Q_{M}- W\times L_{M}$ Payments to land $owners=P_A\times Q_A-W\times L_A$
- [Returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on capital and land are:
Payments$$\frac{to\textit{ capital owners}}K=\frac{P_M\times Q_M-W\times L_N}K$$
Rk=$$\frac{\text{nts to land owners}}T=\frac{P_A\times Q_A-W\times L_A}T$$
Rr =

##  Earnings of Capital and Land
- $\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{K}}$ and $\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{T}}$ may be calculated based on marginal product of capital and land respectively$$R_K=P_M\times MPK_M, R_T=P_A\times MPT_A$$
- Either method may be used depending on available data
- $\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{K}}$ and Rt are rental rates on capital and land respectively
- Rental is periodic return, does not matter whether capital or land is actually rented or owned
- If owned think of as [return on investment](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2014%20-%20Private%20Equity,%20Pension,%20and%20Sovereign%20Funds/Private%20Equity.md)

##  Changes in Return on Capital and Land
- Change in return as relative prices change
- Raise prices on manufactured goods, holding agricultural goods prices constant
. Result:
- Price increase increases quantity of labor used in manufacturing
- Raises marginal product of manufacturing specific factor
 - Reduces marginal product of agricultural specific factor

##  Changes in Return on Capital and Land
- To achieve labor market equilibrium:$$P_M\uparrow\Rightarrow\begin{Bmatrix}L_M\uparrow, so\: that\:MPK_M=\frac{R_K}{P_M}\uparrow\\\\L_A\downarrow, so\: that\:MPK_A=\frac{R_T}{P_A}\downarrow\end{Bmatrix}$$
- Real rental rate in terms manufactured goods increases - percentage increase in $R_K$ exceeds percentage increase in $P_{M}$ allowing capital owners to purchase more manufactures
. $P_A$ is unchanged, so $R_K/P_A$ also increases, allowing capital owners to purchase more agricultural goods

##  Changes in Return on Capital and Land
- Owners of capital are unambiguously better off
- Since labor leaves agriculture, real rental on land in terms agricultural goods, $R_T/P_A$ falls-$R_T$ declines, $P_A$ unchanged
- Since $P_{M}$ increases, $R_T/P_M$ decreases by an even larger amount than $R_T/P_A$ , owners of land cannot buy as many manufactured goods as well
- Owners of land are unambiguously worse off
- Outcome for labor is ambiguous. They will be able to purchase fewer manufacturers but more agricultural goods

#  Work It Out Example (p 89)
. Assumptions
- Manufacturing:
- Sales Revenue: 150
 -  Labor Payments: 100
 -  Capital Payments: 50
- Agriculture
- Sales Revenue: 150
 - Labor Payments: 50
 -  Capital Payments: 100

##  Work It Out Example (p 89)
. Questions:
 - Holding manufactured goods prices constant:
- Raise agricultural prices 20%
 - Wages 10%
- Determine impact of the agriculture price increase on the rental rate on land and on capital
- Explain what has happened to the real rental rate on land and on capital

##  Work It Out Example (p 89)
 - Manufacturing Revenue
	 - $P_m * Q_m = 150$
	-  $W* L_m = 110$
 - Labor Payments
	 - $\mathbb{R}_{\mathbb{K}}\times\mathbb{K}=40$
 - Capital Payments
	-  $P_A * Q_A = 180$ .
- Agriculture Revenue
	- $W * L_a = 55$
 - Labor Payments
 - Capital Payments

#  Work It Out Example (p 89)
- Change in [return on capital](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) = $△R_k/R_k$
	-  ${} (0\% * 150 - 10\% * 100)/50 = - 20\%$
- Change in return on land = △Rt/RT
- $(20\% * 150 - 10\% * 50)/100 = + 25\%$
- The real rental rate on land increased $25\%$
- Landowners gain from both the price increase and the fact that labor is a smaller factor of production, making the wage increase impact smaller.
- Owners of manufacturing capital lose $20\%$ both because prices do not increase and labor is a larger factor of production.
General Equation for Change in Factor Prices
- The following inequalities summarize the relationship among factors:$$\text{ease in P}_M,\frac{\Delta R_T}{R_T}<0<\frac{\Delta W}W<\frac{\Delta P_M}{P_M}<\frac{\Delta R}{R_K}$$$$e\: in\: P_M,\frac{\Delta R_K}{R_K}<\frac{\Delta P_M}{P_M}<\frac{\Delta W}{W}<0<\frac{\Delta R_T}{R_T}$$$$ase\: in\: P_{A},\frac{\Delta R_{K}}{R_{K}}<0<\frac{\Delta W}{W}<\frac{\Delta P_{A}}{P_{A}}<\frac{\Delta R_{T}}{R_{T}}$$

#  Policy Application
- US employment shifted from manufacturing to service sector over past 70 years
- Shifts in other countries as well
 ![500](Attachments/500-584.jpg)
Real Hourly Earnings
 ![500](Attachments/500-591.jpg)
- Masks differences in skill levels in services sector

##  Employment Losses and Reemployment
- Employment losses due to technology and trade
- Difficult to retrain and reemploy many manufacturing workers$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}

##  Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA)
- Real workers unable to transition seamlessly
- US provides TAA to help workers transition
- Inflexibility of wages may lead to increased unemployment
- Unemployment may last more than one year
- TAA provides
 Additional unemployment insurance payments
 -  Health insurance
 - Training assistance
Issues for Displaced Manufacturing Workers
- Displaced manufacturing labor often moves to service sector
- Often long time before finding a positions
 - Often face lower wages

Ricardian Model
September 29, 2022

###  Ricardian Model
- Developed by [David Ricardo](../International%20Finance/Globalization/Chapter%202-The%20Principle%20Of%20Comparative%20Advantage.md) in early 1800's
- Despite the date - it's all about technology
- Comparative Advantage
 - Absolute Advantage
. Resources
- Labor
 - Capital

##  Ricardian Model
 - Factors of Production
- General term
- Includes:
- Labor
 -  Equipment and Machinery
 - Land
 -  Buildings
 -  Minerals

##  Ricardian Model
- Previously belief was that country must hold absolute advantage to make trade worthwhile
- Lowest production cost in the world
 - Implies best technology, lowest wages, unique natural resources
- Ricardo demonstrates that only comparative advantage
- Required for mutually beneficial trade
- Labor only mobile resource - capital indirectly considered

###  Ricardian Model
- Ricardo's goal was to demonstrate the benefits of free trade
- Opposed then prominent mercantilists
- Counterintuitive idea: even if cost of production for all goods a country produced higher than trading partners, still benefit by exporting the good that country produces most efficiently

#  Assumptions
- Land and capital requirements ignored
- Marginal Productivity of Labor (MPL) constant
 - Constant [returns](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) to scale
 - Laborers equally skilled and available to either industry
 - Two industries, perfect competition
 - Wheat farming
 - Cloth production

##  Example
- Two countries: Home, Foreign
 - Home labor supply L= 25
- Home MPL
- Wheat: MPLw = 4 bushels (bu)
- Cloth: MP$L_{C}$= 2 yards (yds)
- MPLs constant - linear Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)

##  Home Production Possibilities Frontier
 ![500](Attachments/500-563.jpg)

##  Home Equilibrium
 ![500](Attachments/500-615.jpg)

#  Home Equilibrium
- Home's citizens choose highest indifference curve available
- In autarky, Home's PPF represents income level - budget constrainte
 - [Marginal rate of substitution](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%208%20-%20Consumption-Based%20Asset%20Pricing/The%20One-Period%20Ccapm.md) equal marginal rate of transformation
- All laborers may choose which industry to work in:
- What does this say about the wage rate?
- What is the value of a unit of work to company?

###  Home Equilibrium$$P_W\times MPL_W=P_C\times MPL_C=\omega,$$
Where $P_W$ and $P_C$ are the prices of wheat and cloth, MPLw and $MPL_C$ are the marginal productivities of labor for wheat and cloth, and $\omega$ is the wage rate
Rearranging we obtain $\frac{P_W}{P_C}=\frac{MPL_C}{MPL_W}$
The relative price of two goods is inversely proportional to the relative marginal productivity of labor

##  Wage Rate
- Given MPLc/MPLw = % then $\mathsf{Pw/P}_{\mathsf{C}}=1/2$
- If price of cloth is \$6 per yard, determine:
 - Price of wheat
 - Wage rate
 - % = Pw/6, Pw = 3$$P_W\times MPL_W=P_C\times MPL_C=\omega $$
- 3 X 4 = 6 X 2 = 12, wage rate is \$12 per 4 bushels or two yards

###  Introduce International Trade
- Allow Home to trade with Foreign
- Foreign possesses inferior technology to Home
- Foreign labor supply L* = 100
- Foreign MPL*
- Wheat: MP$L_{w}^{* }$= 1 bu
 - Cloth: $\mathrm{MPL}_{\mathrm{C}}^{*}=1$ yd
Foreign Production Possibilities Frontier
 ![500](Attachments/500-588.jpg)
Foreign No-trade Equilibrium
 ![500](Attachments/500-585.jpg)
Home and Foreign Comparative Advantage
- What is Foreign's opportunity cost of cloth?
- Of wheat?
- What is Home's opportunity cost of cloth?
- Of wheat?
Home and Foreign Comparative Advantage
- What is Foreign's opportunity cost of cloth? 1 bu. Wheat
 - Of wheat? 1 yd. Cloth
- What is Home's opportunity cost of cloth? 2 bu. Wheat
 - Of wheat? % yd. Cloth
- Home has comparative advantage in wheat farming
- Foreign has comparative advantage in cloth production

##  International Trade Equilibrium - Home
 ![500](Attachments/500-618.jpg)

##  Prices, Volumes and Wages
- Relative price will be determined by world demand
- Will be at a level where both countries can consume more of one or both goods, assume $\mathsf{Pw/Pc}=2/3$$$\left (\frac{P_W}{P_C}\right)\times\left (\frac{MPL_W}{MPL_C}\right)=\left (\frac 23\right)\times\left (\frac 42\right)=\left (\frac 43\right)>$$
Therefore wages paid in wheat farming will exceed wages in the cloth industry
- What implications do you see for production in each country?
- Trade will occur on the world price line (BC)

##  Implications of Ricardian Model
- Gains from trade for both countries
·Each country
- Consumes more
- Specializes entirely in production of one good
 -  Home -wheat
 - Foreign - cloth
- Risk of production interruption ignored

##  International Trade Equilibrium -- Foreign
 ![500](Attachments/500-584.jpg)

#  More on Wages
- Trade patterns determined by comparative advantage
 - Wages determined by absolute advantage
 - Determine wages at Home and Foreign
 -  Nominal versus real
 - Nominal in [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) terms
 - Real "how much can I buy?"

##  More onWages
·Pw/Pc= 2/3
- Real wage determination:
- Home
- $MPL_{W}=4$ bu. Of wheat
 -  $(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{W}}/\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{C}})$XMPLw=(2/3) X 4=8/3 yds. Of clot h
- Foreign
 -  MP$L_C$= 1 yd. Of cloth
 -  (Pc*/Pw*) xMPLc* = (3/2) X 1 = 3/2 bu. Of wheat

##  Labor Productivity and Wages
- Productivity measured by value-added per hour
- Greater productivity generally implies higher wages
- Relationship varies greatly
- Will discuss reasons why in a couple of weeks
 ![500](Attachments/500-618.jpg)

##  Determining International Prices
- Demonstrate how the world price is determined
- Supply and demand
- Home export supply
 - Foreign import demand
- Construct Home export supply curve
- Based on relative price levels
 - Why is the curve horizontal at %?

##  Home Production, Consumption and Exports
 ![500](Attachments/500-547.jpg)
Home Export Supply and Foreign Import Demand
- Wheat production and export supply is a function of Pw/Pc
-  1/2 or lower no incentive to export
 -  Production may occur anywhere along PPF
 - Indifferent to trade
 - 1/2 to 1 increasing exports to Foreign
 - 1 or greater, Foreign indifferent to imports
·If $\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{W}}/\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{C}}>1$ or < 1/2 implies one country is much larger causing the large country to be indifferent to trade

###  Foreign Production, Consumption and Imports
 ![500](Attachments/500-613.jpg)

##  International Equilibrium
 ![500](Attachments/500-614.jpg)

##  Terms of Trade
- Refers to the price of a country's exports divided by the price of its imports
- Rise in export prices raises terms of trade
- Decline in import prices raises terms of trade
- Generally, viewed as positive for country if terms of trade increase
- Why might this be incorrect?

#  Prebisch-Singer Hypothesis
- Price of [primary commodities](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Primary%20vs.%20Secondary%20Commodities.md) relative to manufactured goods would decline over time
-  Generally exported from developing countries
- Expect terms of trade to decline over time
- Reasoning:
- As wealth increases a smaller share is spent on food
- Increasing world income implies decreasing relative food demand
 -  Substitutes increasingly found for natural minerals

#  Prebisch-Singer Hypothesis
- Real-world data do not show it to be a good generalization
 - Technological improvements lead to rapidly decreasing prices for manufactured goods
 - Terms of trade for industrialized countries declines
 - Cartels, or limited locations for production, restrict supplies of some [commodities](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)
 - Population growth and increasing wages in developing countries has increased food demand

## Foreign Exchange
- Foreign exchange is the buying of one [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) in exchange for selling another
 - We do not normally think about purchase and sale transactions in these terms
  - No different than buying a car and selling your cash (or taking out an auto loan) to pay for it
-  We give up the opportunity to invest that cash or have to pay interest to borrow it

## Currency Quotations
- Currencies may be quoted in terms of:
  - Number of units of home [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) per unit of foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)
- Known as "Direct" or "American" terms
  - Number of units of foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) per unit of home [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)

## Currency Quotations
 American terms quotation originated in Us [futures markets](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md)
-  Currencies quoted in terms of USD per Yen, e.g., one Yen equals \$. 007380
-  Easier to calculate profits and losses by standardizing quoting in terms of US dollars
- American terms also called "Direct" terms

### Currency Quotations
·"European terms" originated in interbank trading of currencies
  - Currencies generally quoted in foreign [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) terms - one US dollar equals ￥135.50
-  Smaller units [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) quoted
-  Fewer numbers to right of the decimal point
- European terms also called "indirect" terms
  - Would ask for a price in "Dollar-Yen"

  - Example: the USD rate moves from ￥135.50 to ￥136.00 the Yen has depreciated by ￥0.50
  - Conversely, the UsD has appreciated an equal amount
  - In terms of their home [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md), a country whose [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) has depreciated relative to another country:
- Pays more for imports
 - Earns more for exports

## Trade-weighted Multilateral Exchange Rate 2020 - 2022
- Dollar strengthens with onset of Coronavirus
- Weakens as global recover appears imminent
·Strengthens late 2021
  - US rates rise relative to other countries
 - [Inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) becomes a concern
  - Supply chain issues persist

## Fixed and Floating Exchange Rates
- Two types of Exchange Rate Regimes
  - Fixed (or pegged) - exchange rate is tied to another [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)
- Example: Dollar - Yuan
  - Floating - exchange rate fluctuates based on demand for a one [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) relative to another

## Foreign Exchange "Arbitrage"
- Say you called a bank in Tokyo and they quoted Dollar-Yen at ￥135.90 - ￥136.00 on ￥1,000,000,000
 - Simultaneously your partner calls a bank in New York and is quoted ￥135.75 - ￥135.85 on ￥1,000,000,000

## Foreign Exchange "Arbitrage".
- Say you called a bank in Tokyo and they quoted Dollar-Yen at ￥135.90 - ￥136.00 on ￥1,000,000,000
- Simultaneously your partner calls a bank in New York and is quoted ￥135.75 - ￥135.85 on ￥1,000,000,000
- What should you do?
  - Buy Yen at ￥135.85 and sell Yen at ￥135.90
  - Earn risk free profit of (￥. 05 X ￥1,000,000,000)/ ￥135.90 = 367,917.59 or \$2,707.27

## Cross-currency "Arbitrage"
- You are an arbitrageur
- You ask three different banks to make a price on the following:
-  Dollar-Yen quoted ￥140.00-￥140.10 by Bank A
-  Euro-Dollar quoted \$1.0400-\$1.0410 by Bank B
-  Euro-Yen quoted ￥145.45-￥145.55 by Bank C
 - What should you do?

## Cross-currency "Arbitrage"
- What should you do?
  - Buy Euro versus Yen at ￥145.55/Euro
  - Sell Euro versus USD at \$1.0400/Euro
-  Sell USD versus Yen at ￥140.00/USD
- Effective buy rate for Euros is:
(145.55/Euro)/(140.00/USD) = \$1.0396/Euro

## Cross-currency "Arbitrage"
- Example:
, $000, 000\times \frac {Euro}{\breve{8} 1. 0400}= - € 9$, 615, 384. 61 $384. 61\times \frac {\breve{\mathrm{¥ } } 145. 55}{Euro}= - ¥ 1$, 399, 519, 230 , 99,519, $230\times \frac {USD}{140. 00}= - \$ 9$, 996, 565.9
- Sold \$10,000,000 worth of Euros at \$1.04/Euro;
 Repurchased \$1.0396 Euros for \$9,996,565.93/9,615,384.61 = Euro
: Profit of \$3,434.07

## Cross-currency "Arbitrage" (Arbitrageur View)
 ![500](Attachments/500-583.jpg)

## Cross-currency "Arbitrage"
  - Dollar-Yen quoted 140.00-140.10
- Asked to make a price in New York on 10 million in Euro-Yen
-  Euro-Dollar quoted \$1.0400-\$1.0410
-  What is your price for Euro-Yen?

## Cross-currency "Arbitrage"
- Implied two way market (if you had to cross both bid-offer spreads)
  - Sell Euros/Buy Yen: Buy Yen at ￥140.00/Dollar;
 Sell Euros at \$1.0400
-  Buy Euros/Sell Yen: Sell Yen at ￥140.10/Dollar;
 Buy Euros at \$1.0410
-  Implied price: ￥145.60 at ￥145.844/Euro
- This is too wide - would have to “lean" one way or the other

## Cross-currency "Arbitrage"
- A reasonable price would be ￥145.61 at ￥145.67 for 10,000,000.00
 - Would this price indicate that you are a buyer or seller of Yen? ·Why?

# Bailout Impact on Central Bank Balance Sheet
(a) Financial Sector Bailout Operation
 ![500](Attachments/500-584.jpg)
Bailout Impact on Central Bank Balance Sheet
- Reserves begin at \$500 million, 50% backing ratio
- Central bank supplies Peso 100 million to [banking](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md) sector
- Maintain constant money supply - no increase in demand for [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)
  - Domestic holdings increase to Peso 6 o 0 million
  - Requires reduction in reserves of \$100 million
-  Backing ratio declines to 40%

## Illiquidity and Bank Runs
- A second type of crisis occurs when
  - Depositors demand [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) (Pesos) instead of holding bank deposits
-  Increases the demand for money in the economy
- Bank assets are largely illiquid - cannot be quickly sold
  - Hold only a fraction of cash which depositors have placed
-  Leads to possibility of a “[bank run](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%206-%20Bank%20Runs/Bank%20Runs%20Deposit%20Insurance%20and%20Liquidity.md)"

  - Against good collateral
  - May be prevented by need to maintain peg
- Initial monetary base Peso 10 o 0 million
  - Reserves: $500 million 50% backing ratio
  - Increase M 0 to $600 million
 - Providing Peso 1 o 0 million [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) to bank depositors
 - Decrease backing ratio to 45.5% (500/1100)

### Lender of Last Resort versus Bailouts
- These distinctions appear clear cut
  - At time of crisis often uncertain
- Which banks insolvent versus illiquid
 - Whether collateral provided is properly valued
- Uncertainty may lead to:
  - Capital flight
-  Peg breaking

 Disproven a decade later

## Origins of the East Asian Financial Crisis

  - Specialized in apparel/shoes requiring high labor content
  - Five countries involved:
 Indonesia Malaysia

- Ratio of exports to imports for five countries indicates
  - Low value added export production or
  - Increasing consumer goods being paid for through increasing exports

## Radelet and Sachs Model
- Based on various potential sources for crisis, the authors develop a probit model to assess which may be most relevant
- Two factors turn out to be statistically significant
  - [Short-term debt](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/When%20Safe%20Proved%20Risky%20Commercial%20Paper%20During%20the%20Financial%20Crisis%20of%202007%202009.md) to foreign reserves

### Exchange Rate Crises
 ![500](Attachments/500-551.jpg)
Exchange Rate Pegs and International Capital Markets I
November 29, 2022

# Fixed Exchange Rate Pegs
- Despite the advantages of floating rate regimes, many countries adopt fixed exchange rates. Must allow convertibility into the other [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) or no real value
-  "Peg" [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) to one or more major floating currencies
  - Two key success criteria:
- Degree of [economic integration](../International%20Finance/Globalization/Chapter%201-Introduction%20to%20Globalization.md)
 - Likely symmetry in economic shocks
- Greater [economic integration](../International%20Finance/Globalization/Chapter%201-Introduction%20to%20Globalization.md) and symmetry of shocks implies lower costs and increased benefits from fixing

# Fixed Exchange Rate Pegs
. Additional Advantages
  - Fiscal Discipline
- Unable to monetize debt
 - Increasing foreign debt issuance difficult
  - Reduces risk of [Inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) Tax
 - Form of seigniorage
- Historically, these advantages do not turn out to be valuable
-  Political issues often trump;
 Leads to poor outcomes

# Fixed Exchange Rate Pegs
- Floating rates may move substantially over time
  - Adjustment process is market driven
- Fixed exchange rates move all at once
  - Pent up conditions create a crisis
-  Sudden stop of capital inflows
-  Substantial, 10% or more, depreciation
- ERM mechanism early 1990's

 ![500](Attachments/500-572.jpg)

##  Industrialized versus Emerging Market Devaluations
 ![500](Attachments/500-578.jpg)
Industrialized versus Emerging Market Devaluations
- Emerging markets often experience much more extreme capital movements
  - Poorer fundamental understanding by investors and lenders
-  Substantial portion short-term borrowings
-  Money pulled quickly when situation becomes uncertain
. Industrialized countries
  - Usually involves labor competitiveness

### Concomitant Crises
 [Banking](../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/HKS%20The%20Banking%20Industry.md)
-  Banks allowed to borrow from foreign lenders
-  Inability to convert and obtain required currencies
-  Depositor runs
- Sovereign and Private debt defaults
  - Federal and regional entities borrowings
  - Large private sector borrowers not allowed to convert

## Fixed Exchange Rate Mechanics
. Assumptions
-  Small, open economy (Home);
 [Currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md): Peso
  - Central bank with two assets:
- Domestic, peso denominated bonds
 - Foreign, dollar denominated bonds
 - Intervenes in [FX market](../International%20Finance/Foreign%20Exchange%20Markets%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Determination.md), buying and selling reserves to maintain $\bar{E}=1$
 - If reserves fall to zero, [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) must float
  - Peg is credible if $i=i^*$

## Fixed Exchange Rate Mechanics
. Assumptions
  - Home output = income (exogenous)
 - Designate Y
  - Foreign price level: $P^*=1$ is stable
-  Home price level is sticky;
 Fixed at $P=1$
  - Home's demand for real money balances M /P
 - Determined by Y
 - $M/P=L (i) Y$

### Central Bank Balance Sheet
- No private sector [financial system](../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes.md)
 - Money supply: M
 - Domestic Credit (Assets): B
-  Holdings of peso bonds
 - Reserves: R
-  Holding of dollar bonds
 - Liabilities equal M

## Central Bank Balance Sheet
- The following equalities must hold:$$M=B+R\mathrm{~and~}\Delta M=\Delta B+\Delta R$$
SIMPLIFIED CENTRAL BANK BALANCE SHEET (MILLIONS OF PESOS)$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Assets Reserves R &  & Liabilities \\
500 & Money supply M & 1,000 \\
Foreign assets (dollar reserves) &  & Currency in circulation &  \\
Domestic credit B & 500 &  &  \\
Domestic assets (peso bonds) &  &  &  \\
\hline
\end{array}$$
- In equilibrium nominal money demand equals supply:
M = PL (i) Y, therefore, R = PL (i) Y - B
- Peg breaks if $R=0$

## Reserve Holdings
 ![500](Attachments/500-536.jpg)

## Reserve Holdings
. $M=B$ is the floating line $(\overline{0 Z})$ , where [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) must be allowed to float
- The backing ratio is $R/M.$ , the percentage of reserves to total money supply
  - XZ is the fixed line, where the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) remains credible
OThedistance of $R$ from $Z$ represents the amount of reserves and therefore the credibility of the peg
  - R/M is critical because it measures the sensitivity of the reserve level relative to the size of the economy

# Changes in Money Demand
·Assume $\bar{P}L (i) Y$ falls by 10%, lowering i
-  Maintaining $\bar{E}$ requires maintaining i
  - Home must sell $1 o 0 million in foreign assets
SIMPLIFIED CENTRAL BANK BALANCE SHEET AFTER MONEY DEMAND FALLS (MILLIONS OF PESOS)$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Assets Reserves R &  & Liabilities \\
400 & Money supply M & 900 \\
Foreign assets (dollar reserves) &  & Currency in circulation &  \\
Domestic credit B & 500 &  &  \\
Domestic assets (peso bonds) &  &  &  \\
\hline
\end{array}$$
- Moves fixed line left and reduces reserve ratio to 44.4%
- Reduces peg credibility
Changes in Money Demand
 ![500](Attachments/500-591.jpg)

## Changes in Money Demand
- Assume $\bar{P}L (i) Y$ increases by 10%, raising i
-  Maintaining $\bar{E}$ requires maintaining i
-  Home must buy $100 million in foreign assets
- Moves fixed line right and increases reserve ratio to 54.5%
- Peg credibility - higher backing ratio reduces risk
  - Increases with economic growth
-  Decreases with economic shrinkage

### Currency Pegs and Risk Premiums
- Have assumed all countries viewed as equally risky
Now introduce differences in economic risk$$
i = i^* + \frac{E_{\text{peso}/\$}^e}{E_{\text{peso}/\$}} + \text{[Exchange Rate Risk Premium]} + \text{[Default Risk Premium]}
$$$$
\text{Currency premium: } \frac{E_{\text{peso}/\$}^e}{E_{\text{peso}/\$}} + \text{Exchange Rate Risk Premium}
$$$$
\text{Country premium: [Default Risk Premium]}
$$

## Currency Pegs and Risk Premiums
- [Currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) premium compensates investors for risk that peg might not hold
- Country premium compensates investors for risks of government default or disallowing settlement obligations
  - Settlement - conversion of the peso into dollars
: Argentina 2001-2002
  - Capital controls;
 Many dollar assets "pesofied"
-  Peso depreciated by 75%

## Pegs and Risk Premiums
 ![500](Attachments/500-585.jpg)
 ![500](Attachments/500-583.jpg)

## Credibility and Contagion
. Credibility
  - Market belief in the country's willingness to maintain peg
-  Euro has substantial credibility despite issues given political will behind common market

## Contagion
  - Risk that similarly situated countries face same risks as a country currently experiences a crisis
-  "Hot money" - better safe than sorry

# Argentina 1990-19951
: Argentina suffered from hyperinflation 1989-1990
  - Prices tripled monthly
  - New president hires Harvard educated economist
 - Replaces Austral with Peso
 - Backs Peso with [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) board-like structure
- Initially, domestic credit constant at Peso 4 billion

  - Federal government ran GDP surplus
	- Real GDP grew 6\% plus from 1991 to 1997
  - [Inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) ran 10% from 1991 to 1994
-  Real exchange rate becoming overvalued by 1994
- Central bank added reserves from 1993-1995

## Argentina 1990-1995
- Argentina increases reserves prior to Mexican "Tequila Crisis"
-  Mexican [financial crisis](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) begins December 1994
  - Contagion risk spreads to Argentina
 - Domestic rates rise
 - Money demand falls
- Money base contracts Peso 1 billion late 1994 to early 1995
 - Moves monetary base from $M_2$ to $M_3$

## Argentina 1990-1995
- 1995 Demand for dollars increased;
 Pesos decreased
  - Managed well by central bank
- However, increased country and [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) risk pushed i to levels which
  - Damaged domestic economy
  - Caused foreign lending to dry up
- Central bank steps in to support commercial banks
Changes in Central Bank Asset Composition
- Examine case where domestic policy change is made
  - Open market operations
  - Direct financing of fiscal expansion
- Domestic credit increases
  - Central bank buys $\Delta B>0$ bonds
-  lIf desires to keep $M$ unchanged,
 - Must sell equal amount of $R$

# Changes in Central Bank Asset Composition

## Reasons for Changes in Asset Composition
- Text notes effects are small
  - Now dramatic given asset purchases by many central banks
 - Bank of Japan
 - US

  - For-profit, regulated, deposit taking entities
Reasons for Changes in Asset Composition
- Insolvency and Bailouts
  - Insolvency - typically defined as: Liabilities exceed Assets
- Not always the case, but bank is no longer a "going concern"
 - Usually caused by poor lending or trading issues
  - Countries often bailout banks
- Protect depositors (usually government has guaranteed deposits to some level)
 - Often protect other creditors as well
 - Prevent bank “runs" Often via "[liquidity](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md)" facilities

Foreign Exchange Rates ll: The Asset Approach in the Short Run, Part II
November 17, 2022

## Unifying the Monetary and Asset Approaches
- Basic equations of asset approach:$$\bar{P}_{US}=\frac{M_{US}}{[L_{US}(i_{\$}) Y_{US}]}$$$$\bar{P}_{EUR}=\frac{M_{EUR}}{[L_{EUR}(i_{€}) Y_{EUR}]}$$$$i_{\$}=i_{€}+\frac{E_{\$/€}^e-E_{\$/€}}{E_{\$/€}}$$
- Relates short-run money market equilibrium to uncovered [interest parity](../International%20Finance/Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md)

## Unifying the Monetary and Asset Approaches
- Basic equations of monetary approach:$$P_{US}^e=\frac{M_{US}^e}{\begin{bmatrix}L_{US}(i_{\$}^e) Y_{US}^e\end{bmatrix}}$$$$P_{EUR}^e=\frac{M_{EUR}^e}{\left[L_{EUR}(i_{€}^e) Y_{EUR}^e\right]}$$$$E_{\$/€}^e=P_{US}^e/P_{EUR}^e$$
- Relates long-run money market model to purchasing power parity

# Permanent Increase in US Money Supply
- Equilibrium assumptions, both Home and Foreign:
  - No capital controls
  - Fixed real income and fixed money supply
  - Zero rate of [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), implying
 Zero rate of depreciation/appreciation
  - Identical [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) due to uncovered [interest parity](../International%20Finance/Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md)
- Introduce permanent increase in US money supply

## Permanent Increase in US Money Supply
 ![500](Attachments/500-584.jpg)

## Permanent Increase in US Money Supply
- Prior to increase in MS, $E_{\mathfrak{\Phi}/\epsilon}^e=E_{\mathfrak{\Phi}/\epsilon}$
- Work backwards from new $E_{\mathfrak{\Phi}/\epsilon}^e=E_{\mathfrak{\Phi}/\epsilon}^4>E_{\mathfrak{\Phi}/\epsilon}^1$
- Begin with:
  - Increase from Mus $M_{US}^1$ $M_{US}^1\textit{ to M}_{US}^2$ M 2 s $M_{US}^2$
- Eventually, [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate increases in same proportion as money supply, resulting in depreciation of Us$ from$$E_{\$/€}^1 toE_{\$/€}^4$$$$:\frac{E_{\$/€}^{4}}{E_{\$/€}^{1}}=\frac{P_{US}^{2}}{P_{US}^{1}}=\frac{M_{US}^{2}}{M_{US}^{1}}>1$$
- New equilibrium where:

## Permanent Increase in US Money Supply Short-run
- Money supply increases from $M_{US}^1$ to $M_{US}^2$ $P_{US}$ remains at $P_{US}^1$
 - Real money supply MS, moves from MS 1 to MS 2 reducing the interest rate from $i_\mathrm{\Phi}^1$ to $i_\mathrm{\Phi}^2$
- Since change in MS permanent, the FR curve shifts rightward
  - Unlike temporary increase where remain on FRi and exchange rate equilibrium at $E_{\Phi/\epsilon}^3$
  - [Expectations](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) shift FR curve from $FR_1$ to FR 2 and exchange rate equilibium at $E_{\Phi/\epsilon}^2$

## Permanent Increase in US Money Supply Short-run
- Market participants expect $E_{\mathfrak{\Phi}/\mathfrak{\epsilon}}^4$ in the long-run
- US\$ expected to depreciate, Euro deposits more attractive
  - Buy at Euros at $E_{\Phi/\epsilon}^2$ , offset $i_\mathrm{\epsilon}-i_{US}^2$ with Euro depreciation from $E_{\Phi/\epsilon}^2$ E/E $E_{\Phi/\epsilon}^2$ to $E_\mathrm{\$/\epsilon}^4$ Es/E $E_{\Phi/\epsilon}^4$
  - Sell at Euros at $E_{\Phi/\epsilon}^2$ , offset $-i_\mathrm{\epsilon}+i_{US}^2$ with USS appreciation from E/e $E_{\Phi/\epsilon}^2$ $E_{\Phi/\epsilon}^2$ to $E_\mathrm{\$/\epsilon}^4$ Es/E $E_{\Phi/\epsilon}^4$
- Overshooting should not be thought of as irrational
Impact of Permanent Increase in Money Supply Over Time
- (a) Nominal money supply increases from Mus to M 2 s
- (b) Since prices are fixed in the short-run:$\circ i_\mathrm{\Phi}^1$
-  is $\circ i_\mathrm{\Phi}^1$ to $i_\mathrm{\Phi}^2$ $i_\mathrm{\Phi}^2$ immediately then moves back to $i_\mathrm{\Phi}^1$ as prices adjust
  - Real money balances move from $M_{US}^2/P_{US}^1$ and then return to $M_{US}^2/P_{US}^2$ as prices adjust
- (c) Price level slowly increases, returning real money balances to $M_{US}^2/P_{US}^2$
- (d) Exchange rate rises to $E_{\Phi/\epsilon}^2 (E_{\Phi/\epsilon}^3)$ and then setles at $E_{\Phi/\epsilon}^4$

A Very Brief History of Floating Exchange Rates
 - Once Bretton Woods was abandoned
  - Exchange rates were more volatile than anticipated
-  Link to fundamental variables which changed little
 - Similar behavior seen in stock markets globally
- Dornbusch model (presented above) small country assumption violated:.
  - Change in policy does not affect other countries
-  Domestic goods imperfect substitutes for imports

### Armington Assumption
- Interaction between trade theory and foreign exchange
  - Simple trade models solely based on comparative advantage - all countries capable of producing the same basket of goods
- Armington proposed goods may be differentiated
  - To point where domestic goods are a poor substitute for foreign goods
-  This leads to changes in relative prices domestically and may lead to incomplete price flexibility pursuant to PPP
A Very Brief History of Floating Exchange Rates
- Other factors:
  - May be unclear whether action is one time or permanent
  - Constant flow of other economic information:
- Country making [monetary policy](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md) change
 - Countries against which the [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) trades
- Leads to uncertainty

## Post-Bretton Wood Exchange Rates
 ![500](Attachments/500-540.jpg)

# Fixed Exchange Rates
- Many countries continue to have fixed exchange rates
 -  Numerous nuances in between extremes of:
-  Freely floating
-  Tightly fixed (hard pegs and narrow bands)
 - Ignoring capital controls for now
 - Government intervenes as needed to keep rate at $\bar{E}$

## Fixed Exchange Rates
- Example: Denmark and the Eurozone
- Denmark's [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md), the Krone, pegged at 7.46038 DKr/E
- Trading band of ± 2.25%
 - Imposes both short- and long-run policy constraints$$i_{DKr}=i_{€}+\frac{E_{DKr/€}^e-E_{DKr/€}}{E_{\$DKr/€}}=i_{€}$$
- No control over [monetary policy](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md)

### Denmark and the Eurozone
- Money supply also fixed relative to prices and output$$\bar{P}_{DEN}[L_{DEN}(i_{DKr}) Y_{DEN}]=\bar{P}_{DEN}[L_{DEN}(i_{\oplus}) Y$$
MDEN=
YDEN, Ppen are exogenous by assumption and ie is exogenous since it is set by the ECB
- Short-run theory still correct, but
  - Monetary authority chooses $\bar{E}$ ,so i = ie by UIP
  - Exchange rate now model input and money supply the output

### Denmark and the Eurozone
 Long-run
PDEN = Epkr/ePeur, so prices a fixed multiple of Eurozone$$P_{DEN}[L_{DEN}(i_{DKr}) Y_{DEN}]=\bar{E}_{DKr/€}P_{EUR}[L_{D}$$
(ie) YDEN] PpEn now exogenous (set by Eurozone) and ie is exogenous since it is set by the ECB
- Long-run model correct, but$\circ\bar{E}_{DKr/\epsilon}$ fixed, so $P_{DEN}$ and $i_{DKr}$ determined by PPP and UIP respectively, determining $M_{DEN}$

  - Usually, "you can't have it all"
-  Must choose two of the three

### Monetary Trilemma
 ![500](Attachments/500-599.jpg)

## Inability to Devalue or Revalue
- The inability of a country to devalue or revalue its [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) may lead to long term imbalances which cannot be resolved
  - This in turn leads to structural imbalances between countries which share a common exchange rate
  - Historically, key problem
- Fixing currencies against gold prior to and after Wwl
 - Bretton-Woods regime subsequent to Wwll
-  Currently visible in the Eurozone

## Inability toDevalue or Revalue
- Chart below shows imbalances between Germany and Italy
-  Similar chart regardless of which northern and southern countries are compared
-  Northern countries benefited from joining the Eurozone through [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) rate adjustment
-  Southern countries borrowed heavily from northern neighbors
- It is unclear how the balances will eventually be resolved

### Short-run Money Market Equilibrium
- If initially at point 2, investors will buy financial assets, bidding up price of investments, lowering the interest rate to $i_\mathrm{\Phi}^1$ increasing real money demand to meet supply at 1
- If initially at point 3, investors will sell financial assets, reducing the price of investments, raising the interest rate to $i_\mathrm{\Phi}^1$ , decreasing real money demand to meet supply at 1

Asset Approach to Exchange Rates
 ![500](Attachments/500-584.jpg)

### Asset Approach to Exchange Rates
- As before, MS is Home money supply, MD Home money demand
- Home market in equilibrium at point 1, where $i_\mathrm{\phi}=i_\mathrm{\Phi}^1$
- FR (Foreign Return) is the expected dollar rate of return as a function of the exchange rate

##. Wher $i_\mathrm{f}$ and $E_{\mathfrak{\Phi}/\mathfrak{\epsilon}}^e$ are eo geneou

### Asset Approach to Exchange Rates
- DR (Dollar Return) is the rate on US deposits, $i_\mathrm{\Phi}^1$
- Exchange rate equilibrium is at $E_{\mathfrak{\Phi}/\epsilon}=E_{\mathfrak{\Phi}/\epsilon}^1$
  - [Expected return](../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) in US Dollars equals return on US deposits
- Assumes full capital mobility
  - Capital controls imply no requirement for DR to equal FR

## Temporary Shock to Home Money Supply
 ![500](Attachments/500-575.jpg)

## Temporary Shock to Home Money Supply
- All exogenous variables remain unchanged
- Initially Home market equilibrium at point 1
  - Temporary increase in Home money supply, MS 1 to MS 2
  - Prices remain fixed at $\bar{P}_{US}^{1}$
- Real money supply increases to $MS_2/\bar{P}_{US}^1$ and equilibrium moves to point 2 at $i_\mathrm{\Phi}^2$
- Lower US return raises exchange rate from $E_{\Phi/\epsilon}^1$ EF/e $E_{\Phi / \epsilon }^1\textit{ to }E_{\Phi / \epsilon }^2$, representing Dollar depreciation at new equilibrium, 2'

### Temporary Shock to Foreign Money Supply
 ![500](Attachments/500-613.jpg)

## Temporary Shock to Foreign Money Supply
- All exogenous variables remain unchanged
- Initially Home market equilibrium at point 1 and remains there
  - Temporary increase in Eurozone money supply
  - Eurozone prices remain fixed at $\bar{P}_{EU}^1$
- Real Eurozone money supply increases, shifting FR curve downward
- Lower Eurozone return lowers exchange rate from $E_{\Phi/\epsilon}^1\textit{to E}_{\Phi/\epsilon}^2$ representing Euro depreciation at new equilibrium, 2'

Foreign Exchange Rates I: Monetary Approach in the Long Run, Part Il
November 10, 2022

## Uses of Monetary Models
- These models do poorly as predictors of exchange rate movements over short and medium term intervals
  - So why do we care about them?

## Uses of Monetary Models
- These models do poorly as predictors of exchange rate movements over short and medium term intervals
  - So why do we care about them?
- Guide central bank policies
  - Most central banks have an [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) mandate
 - May be coupled with an employment mandate
-  Focus on real growth
-  Viewed as guide to long-term decision making

## Uses of Monetary Models
- Caveats
  - Everything is never equal
  - Assumes prices are flexible and PPP holds

## Uses of Monetary Models
- Two examples:
  - One-time unanticipated increase in US money supply
-  Unanticipated increase in the growth rate of US money supply
- No changes to Eurozone economy

### Example 1
- Unanticipated one-time 10% increase in money supply
- Real money balances constant - no change in real income/production$$\frac{\Delta E_{\$/€, t}}{E_{\$/€, t}}=(\mu_{US, t}-\mu_{EUR, t})-(g_{US, t}-g_{El}$$$$\frac{\Delta E_{\$/€, t}}{E_{\$/€, t}}=(. 10-0)-(0-0)=10\%$$

## Example 2
- Unanticipated increase in the rate of money growth - from μ toμ+ △μ
- Real money balances constant - no change in real income/production$$rowthrateofP_{US}=\frac{M_{US}}{\bar{L}_{US}Y_{US}}=\mu_{US, t}-g$$
Becomes$$\frac{E_{\$/€, t}}{E_{\$/€, t}}=(\mu_{US, t}-\mu_{EUR, t})-(g_{US, t}-g_{EUR}$$$$\frac{\Delta E_{\$/€, t}}{E_{\$/€, t}}=(\mu_{US, t}+\Delta\mu_{US, t}-\mu_{EUR, t})-(g_{t}$$

## Exchange Rates and Money Growth
 ![500](Attachments/500-576.jpg)

### Hyperinflation
 ![500](Attachments/500-566.jpg)

## Hyperinflation
- Economists define as 50% per month - often defined in the Press as 1000% per year
- Typically caused by policies such as:
  - Extreme austerity
  - [Borrowing in foreign currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%203%20Swaps-%20Financial%20Instruments/The%20Value%20of%20the%20Swap%20Contract%20after%20Initiation.md) - supporting projects of little value
-  Theft, corruption by federal government
- Issues with drawing too many conclusions from graph above
Hyperinflation and Demand for Real Balances
 ![500](Attachments/500-564.jpg)
Hyperinflation - Money Supply and Demand
- Staple goods in dramatically short supply
- Government cannot print money fast enough
  - Literally in the pre-1990's
-  Money in pocket may lose % its value in days or hours
  - No one wants to hold nominal money balances - spend immediately to meet demand for goods
- Banks won't lend in such environments - no commercial bank money creation

## Quantity Theory of Money
·Two ideas
  - Value to holding money:
- Transactions [Investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) opportunities
  - Costs to holding money:
- Interest, $i_{\Phi}$ , missed (assuming > 0)
 - Imoney usually viewed as zero
 - Until recently, imoney negative for institutional deposits in some countries

## Demand for Money Drivers
- Ceteris paribus,
  - An increase in nominal production increases the value and number of transactions and therefore money demand
  - An increase in [nominal interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md) will decrease the demand for money$M^d=L (i)\cdot PY$ ,now $L$ is a decreasing function of [nominal interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md). Realt $money\textit{ demand, }\frac {M^d}P= L ( i) \cdot Y$ is $a$ fun ction
Of [nominal interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md) and real income.

### Demand for Money Drivers
 ![500](Attachments/500-589.jpg)

## Money Market Equilibrium
- Equilibrium where supply equals demand:
M = Li) Y, where M is the nominal money supply
- Under the quantity theory $L$ was a constant
  - No impact from [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md)
  - In general model, [nominal interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md) a key variable
- Central bank targeting of rates and money supply

  - Implies market participants
- Develop [expectations](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) based on Keynes' general theory
 - Look at economic indicators to determine expected rate of [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)
  - These determine expected change in exchange rates
- Next look at interest rate markets
[Inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), Foreign Exchange and [Interest Rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md)
- Uncovered [interest parity](../International%20Finance/Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md) states:$$\frac{\Delta E^e_{\$/€, t}}{E_{\$/€, t}}=i_{\$}-i_{€}$$
- States that market participants expect that the differential in [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) will be offset by a change in the exchange rate
- The above implies:$$i_{\$}-i_{€}=\pi_{US}^e-\pi_{EUR}^e$$
- Known as the Fisher Effect

### The Fisher Effect
- Implies that, all else equal:
  - A rise or fall in the [expected inflation rate](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md) in a country leads to an equal rise or fall in [nominal interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md)
  - Example:
- [Expected inflation rate](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md) in US is $2\%$ annually
 - [Expected inflation rate](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md) in Eurozone is -1% annually
 - Differential $\pi_{US}^e-\pi_{EUR}^e=3\%$
 - Therefore the differential $i_{\mathfrak{\Phi}}-i_{\mathfrak{\epsilon}}=3\%$

## Real Interest Parity
- Calculate real interest rate in each country by rearranging:
Is - ie = πUs -πeuR to obtain, $i_{\Phi}-\pi_{US}^e=i_{\epsilon}-\pi_{EUR}^e$ giving the result that [real interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Aggregate%20Production.md) in each country must be the same
- Implies there are no real return arbitrages available
That is, $r_{US}^e=r_{EUR}^e$ ,known as real [interest parity](../International%20Finance/Covered%20and%20Uncovered%20Interest%20Parity.md). If capital flows are free, then only one available real rate of $return, r^*=r_{US}^e=r_{EUR}^e$ No consideration of risk in this analysis

### Global Real and Nominal Returns
- The long run implications of the [law of one price](Pricing%20Forwards,%20Futures,%20Bonds,%20Swaps,%20Swaptions,%20Caps%20and%20Floors%20under%20No-Arbitrage%20and%20Risk-Neutral%20Pricing.md) and purchasing power parity are:$i_{\mathfrak{s} }= r_{US}^{e}+ \pi _{US}^{e}= r^{* }+ \pi _{US}^{e}$ and $i_{\mathfrak{e} }= r_{EUI}^{e}$ ie=rEui $i_{\mathrm{\epsilon}}=r_{EUR}^e+\pi_{EUR}^e$ = r* +πeur, therefore, r* the global real rate of return, plus each country's [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate equals its domestic interest rate
- What we see in the world differs substantially from this
  - Capital flows based on:
 Differing risk/return [expectations](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md)

- Differs from quantity theory since [liquidity](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) demand is now a function of [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md)$$\frac{P_{US}}{P_{EUR}}=\frac{\frac{M_{US}}{L_{US}(i_{\$}) Y_{US}}}{\frac{M_{EUR}}{L_{EUR}(i_{€}) Y_{EUR}}}=\frac{(M_{US}/M_{E}}{(\: L_{US}(i_{\$}) Y_{US}/L_{EU}}$$
E\$/e= (ie) YEUR)
- General model remains valid when [nominal interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md) change
- Quantity theory valid only if [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) unchanged over the long run

### Interest Forecasts with General Model
- The US Federal Reserve announces :
  - A one-time unanticipated change in money supply growth rate by 10%. No change in real income in US and Eurozone
- M/P constant due to constant real income
 - Euro money supply and price levels constant
 - PPP implies that E and P change in same proportion, dollar depreciates 10% - same as Monetary model
  - Money supply growth rate now $\mu_{US}+\Delta\mu_{US}$ versus μus
- Fisher effect - US raises [interest rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) by $\Delta\mu_{US}=\Delta i_{\Phi}$
 - Real money balances fall in response, price level jumps so real rate remains constant

Foreign Exchange Rates I: Monetary Approach in the Long Run, Part I
November 8, 2022

## Long-run Theory of Exchange Rates
- Often utilized in policy discussions
  - Provides good long-run framework (several years)
-  No value in short-term analysis of exchange rates
- Leads to understanding of central bank policies
  - [Monetary policy](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Economist%20Regime%20Change.md)
-  Exchange rate regimes
-  Bank regulation

## The Law of One Price
- [Law of One Price](Pricing%20Forwards,%20Futures,%20Bonds,%20Swaps,%20Swaptions,%20Caps%20and%20Floors%20under%20No-Arbitrage%20and%20Risk-Neutral%20Pricing.md) (LOOP) - exchange rates reflect identical real price for a single good globally when expressed in a common [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)
  - Assumes
- Integrated market Free competition
 - No price manipulation
- LooP is a broader concept than implied by the text
  - Any [investment](../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) providing identical outcomes must have the same price at a point in time

### The Law of One Price
- Market equilibrium implies no [arbitrage opportunities](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md) - integrated market
- [Law of One Price](Pricing%20Forwards,%20Futures,%20Bonds,%20Swaps,%20Swaptions,%20Caps%20and%20Floors%20under%20No-Arbitrage%20and%20Risk-Neutral%20Pricing.md) example$$q_{US/EUR}^g=\frac{E_{\$/€}P_{EUR}^g}{P_{US}^g},$$
Where $q_{US/EUR}^g$ is the relative price of good g, $E_{\mathfrak{S}/\epsilon}P_{EUR}^g$ is European price in USD and $P_{US}^g$ is the US. Price in USD

### The Law of One Price
- Three possibilities:$$\begin{aligned}
Q_{US/EUR}^g>1,<1,=1. \\
Q_{US/EUR}^g>1\textit{ or<1 implies arbitrage} \\
\text{good more expensive in Europe or US} \\
Only\quad q_{US/EUR}^g=1\text{ meets law of o}
\end{aligned}$$
Opportunity;
 Respectively. Same price.
- Exchange rate must equal the relative price of the good in each country for LooP to apply$$E_{\$/€}=\frac{P_{US}^g}{P_{EUR}^g}$$

## Example: the Law of One Price
- Since there are frictions, and some goods are effectively nontradable, $q$ , the real exchange rate, is rarely 1
- Example, iPhone 13:
  - Prices$$\begin{aligned}&\bullet\: E_{\frac{\$}{\epsilon}}=\$1.0550\\&\bullet\: P_{US}=\$799\\&\bullet\: P_{EUR}=€899\: (Germany)\end{aligned}$$$$\bullet q_{US/Euro}^{iphone 13}=(\frac{\$1.0550}{€1})\cdot€899/\$799\\\bullet q_{US/Euro}^{iphone 13}=1.1870\: US\: iPhone\: 13 s/1$$
1 in Europe

## Purchasing Power Parity
- Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) holds that exchange rates reflect the same real price for an identical basket of all goods
- PPP represents the idea that LOOP holds for all goods (and services) available in two countries
  - That is, the real price of all goods (typically expressed as a basket of finished goods) is identical

## Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
- [Law of one price](Pricing%20Forwards,%20Futures,%20Bonds,%20Swaps,%20Swaptions,%20Caps%20and%20Floors%20under%20No-Arbitrage%20and%20Risk-Neutral%20Pricing.md) applied to all goods (and services) available in two or more countries$$q_{US/EUR}=\frac{E_{\$/€}P_{EUR}}{P_{US}},$$
Where qus/eur is the relative price of all goods, g, in a basket, Es/ePeuR is European price in USD and Pus is the US. Price in USD
When qus/EuR = 1 at all times,
There is no [arbitrage](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) opportunity for the basket - this isknown as absolutePPP

# The Real Exchange Rate
- Nominal versus real variables
  - Nominal - contractual price, e.g., buy \$5,000,000 versus Yen at ￥135.50/\$
-  Real - number of baskets of common goods you can buy in Japan versus the US with \$5,000,000 or ￥677,500,000
- When comparing the US and the Eurozone, the real exchange rate is:
QuS/EUR =s/ePEuR where qus/euR the number
-
US baskets required to purchase one Eurozone basket
Absolute PPP and Real Exchange Rates
  - A change in the [nominal exchange rate](../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) or
- Real exchange rate appreciation or depreciation due to either:
-  A change in relative price of the goods basket
- Absolute PPP states: real exchange rate is equal to 1 q us > 1, European goods relatively expensive, EUR USD said to be weak or undervalued;
Q us < 1, European goods relatively inexpensive, EUR USD said to be strong or overvalued

### Over- and Undervaluation
- IPhone example above:
  - If the price of the iPhone in Germany and the US was identical to relative price of a basket of goods in each country, then the Euro would be 18.7% overvalued versus USD
- The USD would be$$q_{Euro/US}^{iphone 13}=(\frac{€1}{\$1.0550})\cdot\$799/€899$$
-  15.8% undervalued versus the Euro

## Absolute PPP and Real Exchange Rates
- Absolute PPP is where qus/EUR = 1,
Therefore, the exchange rate implied by absolute PPP is$$E_{\$/€}=\frac{P_{US}}{P_{EUR}}$$
- Comparisons of GDP, for example, "at purchasing power parity" are derived from the above
- GDP comparisons are not derived using actual (nominal) exchange rates
  - Do not reflect the current relative prices of goods

## Relationship between Inflation and Depreciation 1975-2005
 ![500](Attachments/500-580.jpg)
Relationship between [Inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and Depreciation
- The relationship between [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and depreciation is strong in the long-run
- This is consistent with absolute purchasing power parity
  - Absolute PPP links the price level with the exchange rate
 - If prices rise at Home, the Home [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) depreciates

## Relative PPP, Inflation and Exchange Rates
- Look at changes in various measures:
  - Rate of [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)
  - RelativePPP
  - Real versus nominal exchange rates
- Now examine the rate of change of the exchange rate versus the rate of depreciation or appreciation:$$\frac{\Delta E_{\$/€, t}}{E_{\$/€, t}}=\frac{(E_{\$/€, t+1}-E_{\$/€, t})}{E_{\$/€, t}}$$

## Relative PPP, Inflation and Exchange Rates
- For small changes in Absolute PPP, changes in exchange rates represent changes in price levels:
From$$\text{a above,}\frac{\Delta (P_{US}/P_{EUR})}{P_{US}/P_{EUR}}=\frac{\Delta P_{US, t}}{P_{US, t}}-\frac{\Delta P_{EUR, t}}{P_{EUR, t}}$$$$=\pi_{US, t}-\pi_{EUR, t}$$
Relative$$\text{ve PPP states: }\frac{\Delta E_{\$/€, t}}{E_{\$/€, t}}=\pi_{US, t}-\pi_{EUR, t}$$
- Implication is that rate of depreciation or appreciation must equal the [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate differential between two countries
Relative PPP, [Inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and Exchange Rates
- Relative PPP states the relationship between changes in [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rates and exchange rates
- This relationship is derived from the Absolute PPP relationship
  - If Absolute PPP is true, then relative PPP is true
  - Relative PPP being true does not imply that Absolute PPP is true

# Money Supply
- Only MO controlled directly by central bank
- Commercial bank money M 1+ controlled by
-  Commercial banks' ability to make profits through money creation
  - Central bank and ministry of finance regulation
  - Key tools
- Reserve requirements
- Interest paid on reserves
 - Lending regulations

### Money Demand
- Nominal money demand is a function of
  - Nominal Income
  - [Liquidity](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) [Preference](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Utility%20Indices.md)$$M^d=\bar{L}\cdot PY,$$
Where $M^d$ is the nominal demand for money, L is the [liquidity](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) [preference](../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Utility%20Indices.md) and PY is the price level times real income. Real money demand is$$\frac{M^d}P=\bar{L}\cdot Y$$
Equilibrium and Monetary Models of Prices
Equilibrium occurs when $M=\bar{L}\cdot PY$ where M is the money supply. Equivalently, $\frac MP=\bar{L}\cdot Y$ iseguibrtum iara termis
- Pursuant to Friedman, price levels are a function of M and $M^d$
Rearranging the above, can express price levels in the US and Eurozone as follows:$$P_{US}=\frac{M_{US}}{\bar{L}_{US}Y_{US}}\mathrm{~and~}P_{EUR}=\frac{M_{EUR}}{\bar{L}_{EUR}Y_{EUR}}$$
- Money is another commodity - Quantity Theory

### Monetary Model of the Exchange Rate
- Using the above, we can express the exchange rate as follows:$$=P_{US}/P_{EUR}=\frac{\frac{M_{US}}{\bar{L}_{US}Y_{US}}}{\frac{M_{EUR}}{\bar{L}_{EUR}Y_{EUR}}}=\frac{(M_{US}/M_{EU}}{(\bar{L}_{US}Y_{US}/\bar{L}_{EUI}}$$
Es$/e = RYEUR)
- Growth in the money supply beyond the rate of growth of the economy causes either depreciation or [inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) or both
Money Supply Growth, [Inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and Depreciation
- Our simple model implies the following:
And$$Define\mu_{US, t}=(M_{US, t+1}-M_{US, t})/M_{US, t}$$
Constant,$$US, t=(Y_{US, t+1}-Y_{US, t})/Y_{US, t}, since\:\bar{L}\: is\: c\\the\: growth\: rate\: of\: P_{US}=\frac{M_{US}}{\bar{L}_{US}Y_{US}}\\\pi_{US, t}=\mu_{US, t}-g_{US, t},\: similarly\: for\: the\\\pi_{EUR, t}=\mu_{EUR, t}-g_{EUR, t}$$
Must equal Eurozone,
- We can now find the formula for the expected rate of [currency depreciation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20I%20-%20The%20Big%20Debt%20Cycle/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises/Inflationary%20Depressions%20and%20Currency%20Crises%201.md)/appreciation
Nominal Rate of Depreciation in the Exchange Rate
Returning
$$\text{ng to relative PPP,}\frac{\Delta E_{\$/€, t}}{E_{\$/€, t}}=\pi_{US, t}-\pi_{E}\\=(\mu_{US, t}-g_{US, t})-(\mu_{EUR, t}-g_{EUR, t})$$$$\frac{\Delta E_{\$/€, t}}{E_{\$/€, t}}=\begin{pmatrix}\mu_{US, t}-\mu_{EUR, t}\end{pmatrix}-(g_{US, t}-g_{EUR}$$
i.e., the difference between money supply growth rates and the difference between real output growth rates equals the [future rate](../Clippings/Forward%20Rate.md) of depreciation/appreciation
Money Supply Growth, [Inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and Depreciation . Example:
  - Given the following [expectations](../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) for one year forward:$$\begin{gathered}
\bullet\:\mu_{US, t}=7.0\% \\
\bullet\:\mu_{EUR, t}=8.0\% \\
\bullet\: g_{US, t}=2.0\% \\
 \bullet\: g_{EUR, t}=1.0\%
\end{gathered}$$
OThe current [spot rate](../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) is: E\$/e, t = \$1.0550/Euro
  - What is the expected Euro-Dollar exchange rate in one year?
Money Supply Growth, [Inflation](../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and Depreciation
- Using our formula$$\frac{\Delta E_{\$/€, t}}{E_{\$/€, t}}=\begin{pmatrix}\mu_{US, t}-\mu_{EUR, t}\end{pmatrix}-(g_{US, t}-g_{EUR}$$$$\frac{\Delta E_{\$/€, t}}{E_{\$/€, t}}=(7.0\%-8.0\%)-(2.0\%-1.0\%$$$$\frac{\Delta E_{\$/€, t}}{E_{\$/€, t}}=-1.0\%-1.0\%=-2\%,$$
And 1.0550*-. 02= -. 0211.
Therefore the expected exchange rate is $1.0339

## Forward Foreign Exchange Swap
- Assume instead that we do not need to pay our supplier until September 21, 2022. However we are concerned that the Euro will appreciate versus the US dollar, so buy Euros June 17
- After we conclude the spot foreign exchange trade:
  - Enter into a two month forward FX "swap"
  - Move the settlement date to September 21

## Forward Foreign Exchange Swap (Bank New York Perspective)
 ![500](Attachments/500-577.jpg)

## Forward Foreign Exchange Swap
- How many dollars does Bank New York send to Bank Frankfort on September 21?
 - What do you think will determine this amount?

## Forward Foreign Exchange Swap
- The amount is determined by the "forward points"
  - Forward points represent the interest rate differential for the time period involved
-  Will go into the theory in a few minutes
- Calculate using available market rates for forward points
  - Add or subtract?
-  Bid or Ask?

# Forward Points

### Forward Points
- Add or Subtract:
  - [Interest Rates](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md):
- US three month: 2.10%
 - Eurozone three month: -0.182%
  - If earn interest differential, pay the points
- To compensate other party for lost interest differential
  - If lose interest differential, receive the points
- As compensation for lost interest differential

### Forward Points
- Bid or Offer?
  - You are the customer, the bank is providing you a service
- So you have pay the more expensive price
  - [Market maker](../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%209%20Bid%20and%20Ask%20Prices%20With%20Private%20Information.md) (bank)
- Earns the Ask price if gives up the interest rate differential
 - Pays the Bid price if earning the interest rate differential

### Forward Points
- US rates are higher than Eurozone rates
  - Bank New York earns 2.10% - (-0.182%) for the period from the spot date to the [forward settlement](../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Bond%20Yield.md) date
  - Therefore it must pay the points to Bank Frankfort the points (and the customer must pay Bank New York)
-  We add the points
- We must pay the Ask (higher) points: 66.411
-  So Bank New York will send $1,046,641.10

 - [Covered interest parity](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Interest%20Rates,%20Carry%20Trades,%20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md)
  - [Forward rate](../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) equals [spot rate](../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) plus interest cost (minus interest benefit) of owning one and borrowing other [currency](../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)$$F_{\$/€}=E_{\$/€}\cdot\frac{1+i_\$}{1+i_€}$$

- Caterpillar asks for a two-way spot price from Bank America without revealing whether it wants to buy or sell Euros
- Bank America quotes $1.1750 bid and 1.1760 offered

-  Say it has no interest at this time
