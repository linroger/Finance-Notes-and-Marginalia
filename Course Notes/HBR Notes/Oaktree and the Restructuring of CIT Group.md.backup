# Oaktree and the Restructuring of CIT Group

[HBR Case Study- Oaktree](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md)

**Part 1 - [Introduction](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Introduction.md) and [Overview](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Overview%20of%20Financial%20Markets.md)**

As the co-founder of [Oaktree Capital Management](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Oaktree%20and%20the%20Restructuring%20of%20CIT%20Group%20(a).md),  I have decades of experience investing in [Primer](A%20[[An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer) on [Distressed Investing](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/HomeMax%20Case%20Study%20Solution.md)|distressed debt]] and guiding companies through restructurings. In this case,  [CIT Group](.md),  a major commercial lender,  was facing a severe [liquidity crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Deciphering%20the%20Liquidity%20and%20Credit%20Crunch%202007â€“2008.md) in 2009 due to the [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) and recession. My team at Oaktree had acquired a substantial position in CIT's [unsecured debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) bonds,  believing CIT's assets would allow for good recovery in a restructuring.

CIT was denied access to a [government debt guarantee](.md) program,  putting them on the brink of bankruptcy. As one of CIT's largest creditors,  Oaktree joined a group providing a $3 billion rescue loan to buy time for CIT to develop a [restructuring plan](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/HomeMax%20Case%20Study%20Solution.md). I will analyze this situation in depth,  explaining the financial ratios,  and walking through Oaktree's [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) process and the choices facing CIT. The analysis will be broken into 10 parts.

**Part 2 - Analysis of CIT's Financial Statements and Key Ratios**

Let's start by looking at CIT's financial statements and calculating some key financial ratios to assess their financial health:

- **Profitability Ratios**
	- Return on Assets (ROA) = Net Income / Average Total Assets
		- Q2 2009 ROA = $-1,   617.8M / $73,  338M = **2.2%**
	- Shows CIT was unprofitable,  earning negative [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on assets.
	- Return on Equity (ROE) = Net Income / Average Total Equity
		- Q2 2009 ROE = $-1,   617.8M / $6,  752M = **24.0%**
	- Very poor ROE shows equity investors were losing money.
- **[Liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) Ratios**
	- Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
		- Q2 2009 Current Ratio = $9,   978M / $8,  814M = **1.13x**
	- Low current ratio indicates potential [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) issues.
	- Cash Ratio = Cash / Current Liabilities
		- Q2 2009 Cash Ratio = $3,   363M / $8,  814M = **0.38x**
	- Very low cash ratio indicates severe [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) strain.
- **[Leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) Ratios**
	- Debt to Equity = Total Liabilities / Total Equity
		- Q2 2009 D/E = $64,   901M / $6,  079M = **10.7x**
	- Very high [leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) ratio,  could make servicing debt difficult.
	- Interest Coverage = [EBIT](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Earnings%20Before%20Interest%20and%20Taxes%20(EBIT)%20Formula%20and%20Example.md) / Interest Expense
		- Q2 2009 Interest Coverage = $-332.9M / $633.6M = **0.5x**
	- Negative interest coverage ratio is very dangerous.

Overall,    CIT's ratios show a company in [financial distress](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Southland%20Corp.%20(c).md) - unprofitable,    illiquid,    and overleveraged. Bankruptcy was a real possibility without swift action.

**Part 3 - Oaktree's [Investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) Thesis and CIT Debt Position**

Despite CIT's troubles,    Oaktree saw an opportunity in its [unsecured debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) bonds trading at distressed levels. Our [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) thesis was:

- CIT had significant asset value that could recover well in a restructuring
- The market was underpricing recovery value due to panic selling
- Longer-dated bonds maturing in 2010-2012 offered best risk/reward

To capitalize on this opportunity,    we accumulated a substantial position concentrated in the 2010-2012 unsecured bonds,    acquired at significant discounts to par value.

For example,    the 8/15/2010 bonds with $11.98M par value were trading around $0.55 on the dollar when we acquired our position. This enabled us to get a bond with $11.98M face value by only paying around $6.59M. The market was [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) in very low recovery values.

Our experience told us recoveries would likely be higher,    potentially generating significant profits on the bonds purchased at distressed prices once the restructuring completed.

**Part 4 - CIT's Choices and Oaktree's Incentives in Restructuring**

CIT had few good options remaining by mid-2009:

- Immediate [bankruptcy](A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) filing - Would lead to asset liquidation,  uncertain outcomes
- Voluntary debt exchange - Difficult without incentives for bondholders
- [Prepackaged bankruptcy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Southland%20Prepackaged%20Bankruptcy%20Submission.docx.md) - Could attract bondholder support with less uncertainty
- Asset sales - Could raise cash but may not solve underlying issues
- Government assistance - Already denied further aid from TLGP program

A prepackaged "prepack" bankruptcy was likely the best option,    potentially allowing an orderly restructuring with creditor support.

As a major CIT bondholder,    Oaktree's incentives were aligned with an orderly restructuring that maximized creditor recoveries. A "free-fall" bankruptcy could lead to lower recoveries,  while an out-of-court exchange depended on voluntary participation.

A prepack would allow Oaktree to:

- Negotiate favorable restructuring terms for bondholders
- Minimize [bankruptcy](A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) uncertainty
- Maximize bondholder recoveries
- Capitalize on CIT bonds acquired at distressed prices

**Part 5 - $3 Billion Rescue Loan Terms and Impact**

To buy time for a restructuring,  Oaktree and other bondholders provided a $3 billion rescue loan with the following key terms:

- $2 billion immediately available,    $1 billion delayed draw
- Due 2012,  [Basis Swap](A%20Guide%20to%20the%20Front%20End%20and%20[[Basis%20Swaps) Mar [Basis Swap](A%20Guide%20to%20the%20Front%20End%20and%20[[Basis%20Swaps) Markets#[London Interbank Offered Rate](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Short-Term%20Rates%20and%20the%20Transition%20from%20LIBOR.md) (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] [London Interbank Offered Rate](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Short-Term%20Rates%20and%20the%20Transition%20from%20LIBOR.md) (LIBOR)]] + 1000 bps,  3% [Basis Swap](A%20Guide%20to%20the%20Front%20End%20and%20[[Basis%20Swaps) Markets#[London Interbank Offered Rate](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2012/Short-Term%20Rates%20and%20the%20Transition%20from%20LIBOR.md) (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] floor
- 5% commitment fee,  1% undrawn fee,  6.5% prepayment premium
- Secured by unencumbered assets worth 8x loan value
- Required acceptable [restructuring plan](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/HomeMax%20Case%20Study%20Solution.md) by 10/1/2009

This loan allowed CIT to avoid immediate [bankruptcy](A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) while providing time to negotiate a prepack plan. It also gave creditors control through strict terms and covenants.

For Oaktree,  it provided influence over the restructuring as part of the Lender Steering Committee while ensuring priority recovery through the secured loan if CIT still filed for bankruptcy.

**Part 6 - Oaktree's Incentives as Lender and Bondholder**

As a large secured lender and unsecured bondholder,  Oaktree occupied two different positions in CIT's [capital structure](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md):

- **Secured Lender**: Priority recovery in [bankruptcy](A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) provides incentive to push for repayment of rescue loan.
- **Unsecured Bondholder**: Incentive to maximize bondholder recoveries in [restructuring plan](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/HomeMax%20Case%20Study%20Solution.md).

This required balancing interests across the [capital structure](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md). An overly aggressive restructuring could scuttle the prepack plan and lead to a chaotic [bankruptcy](A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) with lower recoveries.

Oaktree needed an outcome that repaid the rescue loan while providing reasonable recoveries across the [capital structure](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md). The loan terms ensured influence over the [restructuring plan](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/HomeMax%20Case%20Study%20Solution.md) while the steering committee role allowed negotiating a fair,  orderly prepack settlement.

**Part 7 - [Prepackaged Bankruptcy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Southland%20Prepackaged%20Bankruptcy%20Submission.docx.md) Planning Process**

A prepackaged [bankruptcy](A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) would allow an orderly restructuring with creditor support under the following general process:

1. Company negotiates restructuring terms with major creditors
1. Classes of claims & impaired/unimpaired claims defined
1. Disclosure statement and solicitation materials prepared
1. Plan + materials distributed to classes for voting
1. Company files Ch. 11 with voted plan already in hand
1. Court approves disclosure statement
1. Classes vote to approve/reject plan
1. Court confirms plan
1. Company emerges from Ch. 11 per plan terms

Key steps for CIT would be negotiating plan terms with creditors like Oaktree,  defining claimant classes,  and obtaining required votes for approval prior to filing. This would streamline the court process.

- *Part 8 - Estimating Recoveries in a CIT [Prepackaged Bankruptcy](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Southland%20Prepackaged%20Bankruptcy%20Submission.docx.md) **

We can estimate potential creditor recoveries under a hypothetical CIT prepackaged [bankruptcy](A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) as follows:

**Total Distributable Value**:

- Net Book Value of Unencumbered Assets: $8B
- Liquidation Value @ 60% of Book: $4.8B

**Total Claims**:

- Secured Debt: $25B
- [Unsecured Debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md): $31B
- TOTAL: $56B

**Waterfall Distribution**:

1. Secured Debt: $25B
1. Ch. 11 Costs: $0.5B (Estimate)
1. [Unsecured Debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md): $4.8B * (Remaining Value / Total Unsecured Claims)
	- $4.8B * ($4.3B / $31B) = $0.69B

**Estimated Recoveries**:

- Secured Debt: $25B / $25B = **100%**
- [Unsecured Debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md): $0.69B / $31B = **~22%**

This demonstrates potential recoveries for Oaktree's secured rescue loan and unsecured bond positions. Actual results would vary based on negotiated plan terms.

**Part 9 - Key Factors in Negotiating CIT's Prepackaged Restructuring**

As a member of the steering committee,  Oaktree would negotiate the prepack plan balancing its interests across the [capital structure](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md). Some key considerations:

- **Secured Lenders**: Ensure full recovery on rescue loan,  prevent dilution.
- **Unsecured Bonds**: Maximize recoveries through discounted debt exchanges.
- **Operating Business**: Sufficient capital and [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) post-restructuring.
- **Asset Sales**: Sale proceeds used to pay down debt vs. fund operations.
- **Creditor Positions**: Offer incentives for broad-based plan support.
- **Court Approval**: Fairness of plan to dissenting creditors.

Negotiating an acceptable plan requires balancing these diverse interests among classes of creditors and the company's operating needs.

**Part 10 - Conclusion**

In conclusion,  CIT's [financial distress](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Southland%20Corp.%20(c).md) presented risks,  but also an opportunity for Oaktree to maximize profits on its [Primer](A%20[[An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer) on [Distressed Investing](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/HomeMax%20Case%20Study%20Solution.md)|distressed debt]] positions through an orderly restructuring. The rescue loan and steering committee role provided Oaktree [leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) to negotiate plan terms and emerge with significant gains for our investors. My decades of restructuring experience positioned Oaktree well to actively participate in and guide the prepackaged [bankruptcy](A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) process.

Thank you for the opportunity to share my analysis of this complex situation. Please let me know if you have any other questions!

**1. Why is CIT in [financial distress](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Southland%20Corp.%20(c).md)? What are the main factors that contributed to CITâ€™s poor [financial performance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Gordon%20Bargain%20Stores%20B.md) in 2007-2009?**

CIT is in [financial distress](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Southland%20Corp.%20(c).md) for several key reasons:

- **Aggressive Growth Strategy**
	- CIT grew loans by 20% annually from 2004-2007,  expanding into subprime mortgages and student loans
	- Loan growth outpaced capital - tangible equity only grew by 7% annually
	- Led to thinner capital cushions and higher risk profile
- **Over-reliance on wholesale [funding markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Runs%20and%20Interventions%20in%20the%20Time%20of%20Covid%2019%20Evidence%20From%20Money%20Funds.md)**: As a finance company rather than a bank,  CIT relied heavily on capital markets rather than deposits to fund operations. When these markets froze in the [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md),  CIT could not access the debt funding it needed.
	- CIT relied on long-term debt and [](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20â€“%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper) for 80-90% of funding
	- Less than 5% deposit funding compared to 30-50% for commercial banks
	- Wholesale funding less stable than core deposits
- **Riskier lending practices**: CIT expanded into riskier lending such as subprime mortgages and student loans in the years leading up to the crisis. These loans experienced higher defaults when the recession hit.
- **Dramatic economic downturn**: The severe recession caused higher loan losses and delinquencies across CIT's core commercial lending businesses as small business customers struggled.
	- Recession caused surge in delinquencies and defaults in core commercial lending [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)
	- CIT Q2 2009 delinquency rate of 4.7% was nearly double the industry average of 2.8%
	- Write-offs spiked from 0.2% of average loans in 2007 to 1.8% in 2009
	- Significantly increased credit costs and loan losses
- **Write-downs and losses**: CIT wrote down $3.3 billion in subprime related assets in 2007-2008. This combined with higher credit costs from the recession led to large losses in 2007-2009.
- **[Financial Crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) Cut Off Debt Funding**
	- CIT lost access to [unsecured debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) markets in 2007-2008 as crisis unfolded
	- [](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20â€“%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper) rollovers dropped from $8 billion per month to near zero
	- Forced to draw on credit lines and use secured debt as alternative funding

**Key Financial Metrics Showing CIT's Deterioration**

- Return on Equity dropped from 15% in 2006 to -24% in Q2 2009
- Non-performing assets jumped from 0.4% of loans in 2006 to 4.7% in Q2 2009
- Interest coverage ratio dropped from 2.1x in 2006 to -0.5x in Q2 2009

**Impact on CIT's [Financial Performance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Gordon%20Bargain%20Stores%20B.md)**

- Return on Assets dropped from 1.6% in 2006 to -2.2% in Q2 2009
- [Leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) ratio jumped from 9.0x debt/equity in 2006 to 10.7x in Q2 2009
- Default risks increased with 66% jump in non-performing loans

In summary,    CIT's aggressive growth strategy without proper risk controls combined with over-reliance on debt funding made it highly vulnerable when the recession and [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) hit. This perfect storm severely damaged CIT's [financial performance](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Gordon%20Bargain%20Stores%20B.md) and brought it to the edge of bankruptcy.

**2. How did CIT fund its operations leading up to the [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md)? How did it change during the [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md)? Why is CIT struggling to refinance its debt now?**

Pre-crisis,    CIT relied heavily on long-term [unsecured debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) (around 80% of funding) along with [](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20â€“%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper) issuance (5-10% of funding) to fund operations. It had very little deposit funding,    with deposits making up less than 5% of its balance sheet.

CIT struggled to refinance maturing debts because of its overreliance on wholesale [funding markets](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Runs%20and%20Interventions%20in%20the%20Time%20of%20Covid%2019%20Evidence%20From%20Money%20Funds.md) that evaporated in the crisis. Secured loans bought some time but did not address the underlying funding gap. This mismatch in asset and liability [duration](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) and over-dependence on wholesale funding ultimately pushed CIT to the brink of [bankruptcy](A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) when markets froze.

CIT's funding model was not sustainable when market conditions deteriorated:

- Historically relied on long-term debt (80%) and [](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20â€“%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper) (5-10%)
- Limited deposit funding cushion - less than 5% of assets
- Minimal equity capital - 6-7% of assets from 2006-2008

When the [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) hit in 2007-2008,  CIT lost access to [unsecured debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) markets and could no longer issue [](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20â€“%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper). CIT could no longer roll over or access enough debt funding to sustain operations. Its credit ratings were downgraded,  making debt issuance prohibitively expensive. [](Class%20Note%2012%20â€“%20Commercial%20Paper#Class%20Note%2012%20â€“%20Commercial%20Paper|CP) rollovers dropped quickly from $8B/month to near zero.

To bridge the gap,  CIT drew on credit lines and increased secured borrowing:

- Raised $3B in a secured loan from Goldman Sachs in 2008
- Drew $7.3B on credit lines in Q1 2008 - immediately maxing out facilities
- Increased secured borrowing from $17B (2006) to $32B (Q2 2009)
- Encumbered 30% of CIT assets with secured debt by 2009

However,  this was a short term patch and did not fix the core funding gap. Credit lines were maxed out quickly while secured debt had limits.

By 2009,  CIT could not refinance maturing debt due to:

- Lack of unsecured market access at reasonable rates
- Inability to roll [](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Note%2012%20-%20Commercial%20Paper.md#Class%20Note%2012%20â€“%20Commercial%20Paper|Commercial%20Paper)
- Credit lines fully utilized
- Assets already heavily encumbered by secured debt

The over-reliance on debt markets without a stable deposit base or adequate equity buffer left CIT extremely exposed when wholesale funding disappeared during the [financial crisis](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md).

**3. What are the unique characteristics of CIT,  as compared to other types of [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md),  that will influence the outcome of the restructuring?**

**Question 3 - Unique Characteristics of CIT Influencing the Restructuring**

CIT has several unique characteristics compared to other [financial institutions](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) that influence the restructuring:

- **Predominantly [Asset-Based Lending](.md)** - Most of CIT's loans are secured by hard assets like airplanes,  railcars,  manufacturing equipment etc. These have tangible value even in bankruptcy.
- **Diversified Loan [Portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)** - CIT lends to over 1 million customers across 50 countries in varying industries. This diversification lowers risk compared to a lender with concentrated exposure.
- **Specialized Lending Expertise** - CIT has knowledgeable staff and industryspecific expertise in areas like transportation and trade finance. This will be difficult to replicate.
- **Lack of Core Deposit Funding** - Only 5% deposit funding versus 30-50% for most banks. This made CIT reliant on less stable wholesale funding.
- **Small Retail Presence** - CIT lacks an extensive branch network or large base of retail customers. This makes it harder to attract deposits but also reduces integration challenges.
- **Not a Bank** - CIT is not a commercial bank. This provides more restructuring flexibility but also eliminates the option of FDIC assistance.

These attributes will facilitate CIT's restructuring as an [asset-backed](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) specialty lender without an extensive consumer presence. The lack of deposit funding increases urgency for a solution.

**4. What are the characteristics of CITâ€™s assets? Does the fact that CIT is in trouble indicate that these assets are likely worth very little? How do value its assets: you can make use of the historical recovery rates for senior secured and senior [unsecured debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) of 80 cents and 45 cents on the dollar,  respectively. The five-year default rate for [senior secured debt](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Note%20On%20LBO%20Capital%20Structure%20Module%20Note.md) is approximately 3%.**

**Question 4 - Analysis of CIT Asset Values and Recovery Prospects**

While CIT is in financial trouble,  an analysis of its assets indicates higher recovery values than the current market [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md):

- Over 75% of CIT assets are loans,  most backed by hard collateral like airplanes.
- CIT 2009 Q2 non-performing loan rate of 4.7% is well below most banks in the crisis.
- Historical recovery rates are 80% for [senior secured debt](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Note%20On%20LBO%20Capital%20Structure%20Module%20Note.md) and 45% for senior unsecured.
- CIT's [senior secured debt](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Note%20On%20LBO%20Capital%20Structure%20Module%20Note.md) [recovery rate](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%203.md) likely higher than 80% given strong asset collateral.

Estimating CIT's liquidation value:

- Total Assets: $71B
- Estimated Loan Recovery at 90% of face value: 90% x $48B = $43B
- Remaining Asset Recovery at 50%: 50% x ($71B - $48B) = $12B
- **Total Liquidation Value = $43B + $12B = $55B**

Compared to total debt of $59B,  this liquidation value indicates potential recovery rates exceeding 90% on secured debt and 70% on [unsecured debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) - far higher than current market [pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md).

The collateral supporting CIT's loans gives confidence that liquidation recovery values should significantly exceed current depressed estimates. CIT's asset values appear poised to recover substantially once stability is restored.

1. **On what terms,  if any,  should Oaktree participate in an additional $3 billion credit to CIT?
	How should it be structured to successfully attract funding from the large investors holding its existing debt? What are the key issues in this structuring of the participation?**

**Question 5 - Terms for Oaktree to Participate in $3B CIT Credit**

I would recommend Oaktree participate in the additional $3B [credit facility](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%204-%20Restructuring%20Public%20Debt/Oaktree%20and%20the%20Restructuring%20of%20Cit%20Group%20(b).md) to CIT under the following terms:

- **Secured Structure**Â - Loan should be secured by unencumbered CIT assets to provide priority recovery and mitigate risk.
- **Short Maturity**Â - 1-2 year term to incentive timely repayment. Longer maturity reduces urgency.
- **High [Interest Rates](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md)**Â - [Pricing](../../Financial%20Markets/Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) should reflect distressed nature of credit. Suggest 1000 bps over LIBOR.
- **Strong Covenants**Â - Strict financial [Slides](Class%20[[Slides%20Note%209%20Bidask.not%20New%202020) 2 Discussion of [Loan Covenants](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%202-%20Debt%20Contracts%20due%20to%20Lack%20of%20Information/Class%20Slides%202%20Discussion%20of%20Loan%20Covenants%20Vs.%20Bond%20Covenants.md) Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] to control CIT's actions. Minimum capital and [liquidity](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) requirements.
- **Fees**Â - Attractive fees for lenders,  including 5% commitment fee and 1% unused fee.

This structure enhances priority recovery,  provides high current income,  and imposes financial discipline on CIT. Key participation issues include:

- Collateral value sufficiency and coverage ratios
- Coordination across existing creditors
- Interest costs for CIT balance sheet

The loan must balance attractive lender terms with viability for CIT's recapitalization. Broad existing creditor participation is also critical for successful syndication

1. **Given the actual structure and terms of the deal outlined in part B,  what do you expect CIT to do next and what is likely to happen? Why?**

**Question 6 - Next Steps for CIT Given Rescue Loan Terms**

Based on the actual rescue loan terms,  I expect CIT will:

- Finalize [restructuring plan](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/HomeMax%20Case%20Study%20Solution.md) with creditor steering committee by October 2009
- Obtain broad creditor support for a prepackaged Chapter 11 plan
- File for Chapter 11 by end of 2009 with pre-approved plan
- Transfer assets to new company per plan,  emerge quickly from Ch. 11

The tight timeline,  strict covenants,  and steering committee oversight will force CIT to move quickly to finalize an acceptable prepack plan.

The secured loan gives creditors priority recovery and influence over the restructuring. This will incentivize CIT management to develop a credible prepack plan that respects creditor interests.

Broad support across [capital structure](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md) will be needed to meet voting approval requirements prior to [bankruptcy](A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) filing. This necessitates negotiating acceptable impairment levels for senior and subordinated creditors.

In summary,  the loan terms put CIT on track for a prepackaged [bankruptcy](A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) by year-end,  shifting [leverage](../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) to creditors while the company restructures.

There are several reasons why Oaktree chose to buy [unsecured debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) rather than just secured debt of CIT:

- **Higher potential [returns](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md)**Â - [Unsecured debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) was trading at deeper discounts compared to secured debt due to higher perceived risk. This gave Oaktree the potential for higher profits if CIT recovered.
- **Analysis showed adequate collateral coverage**Â - Oaktree's analysis gave confidence that CIT's asset values and collateral provided adequate coverage for secured lenders to be repaid in full. This meant [unsecured debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) would get the remaining equity upside.
- **Diversification**Â - Buying both secured and [unsecured debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) allowed Oaktree to diversify its CIT investments across the [capital structure](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md) rather than concentrate in just one area.
- **Flexibility in restructuring**Â - Holding [unsecured debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) in addition to making the rescue loan gave Oaktree more influence and flexibility in negotiating a [restructuring plan](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/HomeMax%20Case%20Study%20Solution.md) rather than being just a secured lender.
- **Ability to buy debt discreetly**Â - The unsecured bonds could be accumulated quietly in the public markets allowing Oaktree to build a position before others caught on.

In summary,  Oaktree saw the discount on [unsecured debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) as an opportunity for higher potential profits while the secured debt provided [downside protection](../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Equity%20Linked%20Note.md). A dual [investment](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) approach took advantage of mispricing across the [capital structure](../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Introduction%20to%20Corporate%20Finance.md).

- In bankruptcy,  all [unsecured debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) is treated as having equal seniority regardless of its original maturity date.
- This means short-term and long-term [unsecured debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) would have the same priority and recovery in a [bankruptcy](A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) liquidation.
- Therefore,  there was no advantage for Oaktree to buy [short-term debt](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/When%20Safe%20Proved%20Risky%20Commercial%20Paper%20During%20the%20Financial%20Crisis%20of%202007%202009.md) that had a higher probability of being repaid at par or close to it.
- By concentrating in longer-term debt trading at steeper discounts,  Oaktree could maximize its potential gains as this debt would recover the same as [short-term debt](../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/When%20Safe%20Proved%20Risky%20Commercial%20Paper%20During%20the%20Financial%20Crisis%20of%202007%202009.md) in bankruptcy.
- Oaktree wanted to buy CIT debt at the lowest possible prices to profit from a [bankruptcy](A%20Strategic%20Perspective%20on%20Bankruptcy.md) restructuring where all [unsecured debt](HBR%20Case%20Study-%20Oaktree.md) recovers equally.
