DIP Financing | debtor in possession]]

# Notes on Debtor-in-Possession DIP Financing

Firms filing for bankruptcy often face even greater pressures after filing for protection under the bankruptcy laws. These pressures stemmed from suppliers and customers shunning the bankrupt firm because of liquidity concerns. To overcome these difficulties,  the 1978 Federal Bankruptcy Code set unified standards for how a debtor could obtain new working capital so that vendors,  suppliers,  and customers would continue with the company during bankruptcy. The debtor company is protected by freezing both its assets and its liabilities,  including working capital bank lines. In place of the corporation,  a new legal entity – the DIP Financing | debtor-in-possession]] – is created. The 1978 Bankruptcy Code provides incentives for lenders to make new debt financing available to the bankrupt firm. It does so by providing a “super priority” lien that gives such a lender a very senior claim on the borrower’s cash flow. This claim stands just behind normal administrative expenses but before existing credits,  including senior debt. The lien also provides for the loan to mature or be repaid before the debtor emerges from bankruptcy. Some of the key features of DIP loans are as follows:

[^1]: The DIP lender has claim to any assets not already backing other credits. If assets are insufficient to cover the DIP lender’s claim,  the DIP lender can make a prior claim on assets already pledged to existing creditors and use them as collateral for the new loan.
[^1]: Most DIP loans are made as part of loan commitments. Commitment fees range from 2.5% to 4% of the line and loan interest rates from 1.5% to 2.5% over prime. In addition,  there are usually syndication fees.
[^1]: Even if the debtor is forced to liquidate while in bankruptcy,  the DIP lender is the first to be repaid.

DIP financing is said to have originated in 1984 when Chemical Bank set up a unit to market DIP financing as a new product. The operation began to blossom in 1987 when Texaco,  Inc. filed for Chapter 11protection after losing a $10 billion lawsuit to Pennzoil Company,    and turned to Chemical with a $2 billion DIP loan request that was eventually scaled back to $750 million. Since its inception,  the market for DIP lending has become fiercely competitive,  but it can also be quite profitable for banks0.\1 The United States Supreme Court,  in its 2004 decision in Till v. SCS Credit Corporation,  1245. Ct. 1951,  noted the existence of a free market for lenders advertising financing for Chapter 11debtors-in-possession. The statutory framework governing DIP loans is Section 364 of Title 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
