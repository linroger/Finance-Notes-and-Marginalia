# 8.1 EXPECTATIONS  

Consider a simple framework with annual periods. Assume for the moment that the current one-year rate is $8\%$ , and that investors know with certainty that the one-year rate in one year will be $7\%$ and in two years will be $6\%$ Then, the prices of one-, two-, and three-year zero coupon bonds with a unit face value, $P(1),P(2)$ , and $P(3)$ , are priced such that,  
$$
\begin{array}{l}{P(1)=\frac{1}{1.08}}\ {P(2)=\frac{1}{1.08\times1.07}}\ {P(3)=\frac{1}{1.08\times1.07\times1.06}}\end{array}
$$  

But by the definition of forward rates (see Chapter 2), Equations (8.1) say that the first three forward rates are. $8\%$ $7\%$ , and $6\%$ . Hence, with  

[investor certainty](.md) as to future [interest rates](../Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md), that is, without any volatil-.   
ity around those [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md), the [term structure of interest rates](../../../Financial%20Engineering/6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md) - here expressed in terms of forward rates - is completely determined by expec-.   
tations. Consequently, depending on [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md), the [term structure](../Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) can.   
take on any shape: flat, upward-sloping, downward-sloping, or some com-.   
bination of these.  

In practice, [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) cannot sensibly take on any arbitrary pattern. The financial community can have very specific views about [short-term rates](Volatility%20and%20Convexity.md) over short horizons, derived, for example, from anticipation of policy changes on central bank meeting dates and from the supply and demand conditions for funds (e.g., tax payment dates, the bond issuance calendar, quarterly balance sheet management). Over longer horizons, however, [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) are not as granular. Analysis of money market conditions is unlikely to reveal, for example, that the expected one-year rate in 29 years is very different from the expected one-year rate in 30 years. On the other hand, macroeconomic analysis might argue that the long-run expectation of the short-term rate is. $4\%$ $1\%$ due to the long-run real-rate of interest. and $3\%$ due to long-run [inflation](../../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918â€“1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md).
