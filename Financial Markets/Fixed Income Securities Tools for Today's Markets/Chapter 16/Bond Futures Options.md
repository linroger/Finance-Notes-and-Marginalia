# 16.3 BOND FUTURES OPTIONS  

Bond [futures](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) in the United States are discussed in Chapter 11. Options on these [futures contracts](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) are traditional or equity-style options, which means that, like options on stocks, purchasers of options pay a premium at the time of purchase and, if exercised, realize their intrinsic values.  

Options on bond [futures](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) can be valued with [term structure models](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md). In a [one-factor model](../Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md), for example, after creating a risk-neutral tree for the [futures price](../Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md), the value of a [futures](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) option can be computed by starting from the maturity date of the option and working backwards, using the rule that. the value of the option at each node is the maximum of the value of holding. the option and of exercising it immediately. Of course, because the delivery options embedded in bond [futures](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) may not be modeled adequately by a. [one-factor model](../Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md), multi-factor approaches might be preferred..  

While simple conceptually, it is apparent from Chapter 11 that build-. ing a [futures](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) model takes a good deal of effort. Therefore, practitioners who do not otherwise need such a model tend to use a [BSM approach](.md) for bond [futures](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) options. The required assumptions are that: the option is European; the [discount factor](../Chapter%201/Discount%20Factors.md) to option expiration is uncorrelated with the underlying [futures price](../Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md); and the [futures price](../Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) is lognormal with constant volatility. The assumption that the option is European, that is, that [early exercise](.md) is not optimal, is reasonable in practice. [Early exercise](.md) of an equitystyle [futures](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) option may be optimal if interest earned on the realized intrinsic value exceeds the time value of the option, but this is rarely the case. For some intuition on this point, note that [early exercise](.md) of a put on a stock may be optimal, because of the potential of earning interest on the entire [strike price](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Call%20and%20Put%20Payoffs%20at%20Expiry.md), not just on its intrinsic value. The assumption that the [discount factor](../Chapter%201/Discount%20Factors.md) is uncorrelated with the bond [futures price](../Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) is not bad in practice. Bond [futures](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) options typically mature in a few months or less, while the bond underlying the [futures](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract typically matures in many years. Hence, the correlation is typically weak between the [discount factor](../Chapter%201/Discount%20Factors.md), which depends on very [short-term rates](../Chapter%208/Volatility%20and%20Convexity.md), and the bond [futures price](../Chapter%2011/Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md), which depends on longer-term rates. The assumption of constant [price volatility](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Black%20Models%20for%20Bond%20Price%20Options%20Capsfloors.md), however, essentially assumes away the delivery options of bond [futures](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md): as rates change and the [cheapest-to-deliver](../Chapter%2015/Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md) bond changes, the Dv01 and, therefore, the [price volatility](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Black%20Models%20for%20Bond%20Price%20Options%20Capsfloors.md) of the [futures](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) changes as well. (See Chapter 11.) While perhaps acceptable when [interest rates](../Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) are low relative to the contract's notional coupon, ignoring the delivery option seems to undercut one of the main motivations for using BSM in the first place, namely, to obtain accurate deltas. Nevertheless, BSM is used in practice in this context.  

Under the assumptions listed in the previous paragraph, Appendix. A16.3 shows that calls and puts on US Treasury note and bond [futures contracts](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) are given by, respectively,.
