# 11.10 IMPLIED REPO RATES  

Table 11.1 and Equation (11.1) compute the [forward price](Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) of the 2.875s.   
of 05/15/2028 given its price for spot settlement and its term repo rate from.   
spot to [forward settlement](Forward%20Bond%20Yield.md). The same relative [pricing](../Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) formula can be applied,.   
of course, to compute the repo rate given a bond's forward and [spot prices](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md)..   
Under the assumption that a particular bond will be CTD into a [futures](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) con-.   
tract, a repo rate computed in this way is called that bond's [implied repo rate](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/The%20Futures%20Bond%20Basis:%20government%20bond%20futures%20and%20basis%20%20trading.md).  

To illustrate, consider, once again, the 2.875s of 05/15/2028 and the data in Table 11.8. If that bond will be CTD with certainty, the ratio of its [forward price](Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) to its conversion factor should equal the [futures price](Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md); that is, its [forward price](Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) should equal $131-17+/0.8338$ , or 109.68379.8 Then, following the logic of Equation (11.1), the relationship between the bond's spot and forward prices and the repo rate, $r$ , is,  
$$
109.68379+1.07813=(110.77344+0.01562)\left(1+{\frac{r\times136}{360}}\right)
$$  

which gives an [implied repo rate](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/The%20Futures%20Bond%20Basis:%20government%20bond%20futures%20and%20basis%20%20trading.md) of $r=-0.065\%$  

It is evident from Equations (11.1) and (11.20) that a lower repo rate generates a lower [forward price](Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md). Therefore, if a bond will be CTD with certainty, and if its [implied repo rate](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/The%20Futures%20Bond%20Basis:%20government%20bond%20futures%20and%20basis%20%20trading.md) is less than its actual repo rate, then the [futures price](Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) is cheap relative to the bond's spot price. Similarly, if a bond will be CTD with certainty, and if the [implied repo rate](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/The%20Futures%20Bond%20Basis:%20government%20bond%20futures%20and%20basis%20%20trading.md) of a bond is greater than its actual repo rate, then the [futures price](Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) is rich relative to the bond's spot price. In the example, under the assumption that the 2.875s of 05/15/2028 will be CTD, an [implied repo rate](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/The%20Futures%20Bond%20Basis:%20government%20bond%20futures%20and%20basis%20%20trading.md) of $-0.065\%$ and an actual repo rate of $0.015\%$ imply that TYU1 is cheap relative to the CTD's spot. price.  

Another way to think about [implied repo](.md) is as the rate earned by buying a bond spot and selling it through the [futures](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract. Rewriting Equation (11.1), with a spot price of 110.77344 and a [forward price](Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) of 109.71721, the return from buying spot and selling forward is just the repo rate,  
$$
\frac{109.71721+1.07813-(110.77344+0.01562)}{(110.77344+0.01562)}\frac{360}{136}=0.015\%
$$  

Similarly, the return from buying spot and selling forward - this time with a [forward price](Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) implied by the [futures price](Futures%20Price%20and%20the%20Quality%20Option%20Before%20E.md) of. $109.68379-\mathrm{i}\mathrm{s}-0.065\%$ . From this perspective as well, then, TYU1 is too low relative to the spot price of the 2.875s of 05/15/2028, so long as that bond is CTD. [Implied repo](.md) as a measure of relative value will be revisited in the case study at the end of the chapter.
