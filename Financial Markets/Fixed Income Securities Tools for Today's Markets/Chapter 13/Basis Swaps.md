# 13.6 BASIS SWAPS  

Both OIS and fixed-for-floating swaps pay interest at a fixed rate on one leg and at a floating rate on the other leg. A [[Basis Swaps|basis swap]], by contrast pays interest at one [[Basis Swaps|floating rate on one leg]] and interest on a different floating rate on another leg. Before the transition away from LIBOR, [[Basis Swaps|basis swap]] volumes were particularly large in exchanging LIBOR of one term against LIBOR of another term, and swaps of effective [[Fed Fund Futures|fed funds]] (see Chapter 12) against LIBOR of various terms were common as well. In US dollar markets, swaps of SOFR against LIBOR are trading actively in the transition period but will fade with the disappearance of LIBOR. [[Calculating Novel Cross-Currency Bases a|Cross-currency basis]] swaps have been and continue to be extremely popular. These swaps exchange interest at a short-term rate in one [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] for interest at a short-term rate in another [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]], for example, SOFR versus STR. This section focuses on basis swaps of STR versus three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] to explain concepts, both because [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] is still an active rate and because foreign exchange rates are outside the scope of this edition of the book..  

Consider a bank that funds itself at STR flat (i.e., without a spread) and lends money to customers at three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] plus $1\%$ . This bank has the [[Lessons From The Crisis|basis risk]] that STR, compounded over a relevant time period, rises relative to three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]], compounded over that same period. In general, by the way, the term "[[Lessons From The Crisis|basis risk]]" refers to the risk that two rates or prices, which usually change together in some fixed or predictable relationship, diverge in an unusual and unfavorable way. In any case, Figure 13.8 shows how the bank can hedge its [[Lessons From The Crisis|basis risk]] with an STR versus three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] [[Basis Swaps|basis swap]]. As of February 2022, the two-year STR versus three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] [[Basis Swaps|basis swap]] spread was 13.8 basis points, which means that the bank, as shown in the figure, can receive STR plus 13.8 basis points and pay three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] on some notional amount for two years. More specifically, at the end of every quarter during those two years, the bank receives interest at daily compounded STR plus 13.8 basis points over that quarter (along the lines of Figure 13.1), and the bank pays interest at three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] set at the start of the quarter (along the lines of Figure 13.2). Overall then, with its [[Basis Swaps|basis swap]] hedge, the bank in Figure 13.8 locks in a fixed rate of $1.138\%$ , so long as its customers do not default. Put another way, the customers pay a credit and [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] spread of $1.138\%$ over the near-riskless

ESTR: $1\%$ as a spread over three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] and 13.8 basis points as a spread of three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] over STR.  

From the swap dealer's perspective, there is virtually no [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]]: the. bank itself is probably a good credit and the [[Basis Swaps|basis swap]] is collateralized.. Because [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] is a riskier rate than STR, however, compounded STR. over a quarter will normally be less than three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]]. It makes sense, therefore, that paying a spread over STR is fair against receiving. three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]], although the market determination of the exact spread can certainly be the subject of further analysis..  

The existence of [[Basis Swaps|basis swap]] spreads shows that not all swaps can be valued using the methodology for [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|pricing swaps]] that is given in Chapter 2 and earlier in this chapter. That methodology argued that the [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|floating leg]] (including the fictional notional amount) is worth par when the floating rate is considered to be the [[Black Scholes Derivation|risk-free rate]], that is, the rate at which funds can be moved without risk across time. And it is reasonable to classify both overnight SOFR and overnight STR as risk-free rates.19 The same is not true, however, for three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]]. Or, to put it another way, it cannot be simultaneously true that i) a [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|floating leg]] paying STR is worth. par; ii) STR plus 13.8 basis point is fair against three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] for. two years; and iii) a [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|floating leg]] paying three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] for two years is worth par.  

The appropriate methodology for valuing a [[Swaptions|fixed-for-floating swap]] when the floating index is not a [[Black Scholes Derivation|risk-free rate]], like [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]], is the following. First, discount the [[Interest Rate Quotations|fixed cash flows]] (including the fictional notional amount) at the discount factors implied by swaps against the [[Black Scholes Derivation|risk-free rate]] index,. like STR. These calculations are described in Chapter 2. Second, the value. of the [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|floating leg]] is equal to par plus the present value of payments of the [[Basis Swaps|basis swap]] spread, where discounting is again done using the risk-free rates. For example, the [[Basis Swaps|basis swap]] in Figure 13.8 shows that the value of receiving three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] equals the value of receiving STR plus 13.8 basis points. But the value of receiving STR (including the fictional notional amount) is par. Therefore, the value of receiving three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] quarterly for two years is par plus the present value of receiving. 13.8 basis points, paid quarterly, for two years.  

Appendix A13.1 illustrates the calculations outlined in the previous paragraph with representative market rates toward the end of February 2022, when the fixed rate on a two-year, fixed versus three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] swap was $0.078\%$ and, as already mentioned, the two-year STR versus. three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] [[Basis Swaps|basis swap]] spread was 13.8 basis points. The values of both the fixed and floating sides are calculated to be 100.281. To summarize, when the floating index is a [[Black Scholes Derivation|risk-free rate]], both sides of a [[Swaptions|fixed-for-floating swap]] at initiation are worth par. When the floating index is not a [[Black Scholes Derivation|risk-free rate]], but trades with a positive [[Basis Swaps|basis swap]] spread against the [[Black Scholes Derivation|risk-free rate]], both sides of the swap at initiation are equal in value, of course, but each side is worth more than par. Note that traders may just accept that rates on newly initiated swaps are fair and, therefore, may not care about the value of each side separately. Nevertheless, a methodology is required to compute the NPVs of existing swaps in a trading book, which are not observable in the market..  

The [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] methodology just described can take rates on STR swaps and spreads on STR versus three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] basis swaps as given to price fixed versus three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]] swaps. Alternatively, the methodol-. ogy can take rates on STR swaps and on fixed versus three-month [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|Euribor]]. swaps as given to imply fair [[Basis Swaps|basis swap]] spreads. The latter approach, called two-curve [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]], is often preferred when basis swaps of all terms are insufficiently liquid. In fact, two-curve [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] typically does not explicitly calculate [[Basis Swaps|basis swap]] spreads at all. A brief description of this methodology is given in Appendix A13.2.  

# Corporate Debt and Credit Default Swaps  

existing debt, stock repurchases). The loans and bonds used to raise these funds are subject to [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]], because corporations may not make good on their promises to pay interest and repay principal. Lenders, in turn, require compensation for bearing [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] in the form of higher [[Assets|returns]]. The cash flows of credit default swaps (CDS) also depend on the payment or nonpayment of debt obligations but are not themselves obligations of corporate issuers. In other words, through CDS contracts, market participants trade corporate credit risks with each other. While this chapter focuses mostly on [[Corporate Bonds and Loans|corporate debt]], much of the discussion applies to sovereign and municipal debt as well, because the debt obligations of many governments have at times been perceived as subject to nontrivial probabilities of default.  

Many market participants rely to some extent on rating agencies to measure the [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] of borrowers and their loans and bonds. The long-term debt ratings classifications of the three major rating agencies in the United States are given in Table 14.1. More granular breakdowns of each of these broad ratings classifications are also available, and [[When Safe Proved Risky Commercial Paper During the Financial Crisis of 2007 2009|short-term debt]] has its own, separate scales.'
