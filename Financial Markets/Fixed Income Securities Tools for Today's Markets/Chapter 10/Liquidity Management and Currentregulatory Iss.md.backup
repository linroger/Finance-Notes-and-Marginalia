# 10.6 LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT AND CURRENTREGULATORY ISSUES  

A financial institution can borrow funds in many ways, some of which are. more stable than others, that is, some of which can be easily maintained. under financial stress and some of which cannot. The most stable source of funds is equity capital, because equity holders do not have to be paid on. any schedule and because they cannot compel a redemption of their shares. Slightly less stable is long-term debt, because bondholders are paid [interest and principal](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) as set out in bond indentures. At the other extreme of [funding stability](.md) is short-term unsecured funding, like commercial paper: these bor-. rowings have to be repaid in a matter of weeks or months, as they mature, when the institutions, under adverse conditions, might not be able to borrow money elsewhere. Not surprisingly, the more stable sources of funds. are usually more expensive in terms of the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) required by the. providers of funds. Through [liquidity management](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Class%20Slides%20Effects%20of%20MMF%20Regulations%20in%20the%20United%20States.md), firms balance the costs. of funding against the risks of finding themselves without enough funding to survive.  

In the spectrum of financing choices, repo borrowing is cheap, but relatively unstable. This instability is evident with respect to short-term repo on credit-sensitive and relatively [illiquid assets](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md). In times of financial stress, many market participants sell these low-quality assets, both to reduce risk and to raise [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md). Meanwhile, in the repo market, lenders both raise haircuts and reduce lending on low-quality collateral. This makes it difficult for repo sellers of that collateral -- like trading desks funding inventory or [hedge funds](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) leveraging trades - to raise cash. And if it turns out that they cannot find sufficient funding, they might be forced to unload their holdings in fire sales that result in significant losses.  

The instability of repo borrowing on high-quality collateral, like Treasuries, is less evident. Before the [financial crisis](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) of 2007-2009, it was widely believed that a firm could always fund its Treasuries. First, in times of stress, lenders are looking for liquid and safe investments. Second, even if the creditworthiness of the cash borrower is called into question, the cash lender has Treasury collateral, which, if necessary, can be liquidated relatively easily.. The [financial crisis](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) dispelled this complacency. Lenders sought to minimize. their connections to troubled [financial institutions](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md), including their buying of. Treasury repo. While they could, indeed, legally liquidate those Treasuries. in the event of a default, the timing and manner of their doing so could be questioned in bankruptcy proceedings and could drag them into years of litigation.  

The [financial crisis](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) of 2007-2009 found many [financial institutions](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) with. highly leveraged positions in mortgage-related assets. As these assets lost. value, an overreliance on wholesale funding,10 from various forms of com-. mercial paper to repo, accelerated the onset of distress. In response, the bank regulatory regime has changed in ways that significantly impact repo partic-. ipants and markets.  

First, banks have become subject to [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) ratios, namely, the liq-. uidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). The LCR requires that banks hold enough high-quality, liquid assets (HQLA) to. meet net cash outflows over a 30-day stress scenario. Reserves held in the [Federal Reserve System](../Chapter%2012/Fed%20Fund%20Futures.md) and Treasuries receive full credit as HQLA, while lower-quality assets may fulfll part of the requirement at a haircut. The. NSFR requires that bank funding of relatively [illiquid assets](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) be stable over a one-year horizon. The direct and intended effect of these ratios is to limit. the amount of short-term, wholesale funding, including repo. Less directly and perhaps less intended, regulators' implementation of the LCR, combined with their additional stress tests of bank [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md), have pushed banks to rely. heavily on reserves to satisfy HQLA requirements.11 This implies that regulation, as currently implemented, discourages using reserves to lend money and take Treasury collateral.  

Second, banks have become subject to a [leverage](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) ratio, called the sup-. plementary [leverage](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) ratio (SLR) in the United States. Unlike risk-based cap-. ital requirements, which require banks to hold capital in proportion to the perceived risks of their assets, the [leverage](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) ratio requires that bank capi-. tal exceed a certain percentage of the value of all assets, regardless of risk. But penalizing large positions regardless of risk discourages large repo positions, which have very little risk per dollar and commensurately low return per dollar. Consider, for example, a matched book business in Treasury repo,.  

mentioned previously, which lends and borrows money on Treasury collateral. This market-making business in extremely safe transactions can make money and cover fixed costs only in large size, but the [leverage](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) ratio discourages size.  

These two sets of rules may have been partly responsible for the aforementioned September 2019 and March 2020 episodes in which banks did not use their [abundant reserves](../Front%20Matter/Monetary%20Policy%20with%20Abundantreserves.md) to lend in the Treasury repo market at abnormally high rates. Or, put another way, regulators are still calibrating the necessary quantity of reserves in the context of a relatively new regulatory regime. In fact, one of the ways the Federal Reserve and other regulators addressed the March 2020 disruption was to exclude reserves and Treasuries from the SLR temporarily, from May 15, 2020, to March 31, 2021.
