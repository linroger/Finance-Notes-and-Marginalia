# 1.7 DAY-COUNT CONVENTIONS  

As mentioned in the previous section, accrued interest is calculated using. the actual/actual convention, that is, by dividing the actual number of days from the last coupon payment by the actual number of days between coupon. payments. Hence the term "actual/actual"' for this day-count convention.  

The actual/actual convention is commonly used in government bond. markets, but, in other markets, different conventions are used. Two of the most common are actual/360 and 30/360. The actual/360 convention divides the actual number of days between two dates by 360. The 30/360 convention calculates the difference between two dates under the assumption that there are 30 days in each month, and then divides that difference by 360. To illustrate, there are 75 actual days between June 1 and August 15: there are 29 days from June 1 to the end of June; 31 days in July; and 15 days to August 15. The 30/360 convention, however, assumes that there are 30 days in every month, including July, giving a total of. $29+30+15$ or 74 days. Money markets typically use the actual/360 convention; swap markets use. either actual/360 or 30/360; and corporate bond markets typically use the 30/360 convention.  

# Swap, Spot, and Forward Rates  

often find it more intuitive to quote the time value of money in terms of interest rates and, in particular, in terms of either swap rates or par rates, spot rates, and forward rates..  

This chapter begins by explaining that interest rates are always quoted. as annual rates, that interest is conceptualized as being paid over a number. of periods of fixed length (e.g., 90 days, three semiannual periods), and that interest rate quotations indicate the payment of either simple or compound interest. The chapter then introduces interest rate swaps (IRS) as context. for the material. Swaps and bonds together comprise a significant portion of fixed income markets, and swaps, because they are relatively liquid,. have become benchmarks against which to evaluate other fixed income instruments.  

At the time of this writing, interest rate swap markets are in transition away from LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), which has dominated floating-rate indexes for decades. Chapter 12 discusses this transition, but this chapter briefly introduces the leading candidates for replacing LIBOR (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the United States) and their associated swaps. Chapter 13 discusses why and how market participants use interest rate swaps.
