# 4.4 DURATION  

Another popular metric for [interest rate sensitivity](../Chapter%2011/Forward%20Bond%20Yield.md) is [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md). Whereas DV01 measures the change in price for a change in rates, [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) measures. the percentage change in price for a change in rates. Like Dv01, [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md). can be defined in any one-factor framework, but practitioners often use the. term [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) to mean yield-based [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) (described in Section 4.7) and use the term effective [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) to mean the more general case presented here.  

Using the same notation as in Section 4.2, [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md), $D$ , is estimated in terms of the slope as,  
$$
D\approx-{\frac{\Delta P/P}{\Delta y}}=-{\frac{1}{P}}{\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta y}}
$$  

and given in terms of the derivative as,  
$$
D=-{\frac{d P/P}{d y}}=-{\frac{1}{P}}{\frac{d P}{d y}}
$$  

Because $\Delta P/P$ and $d P/P$ both represent percentage change in price, Equations (4.10) and (4.11) express [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) as the percentage change in price for a change in rates. Also, for intuition, it is useful to rewrite Equation (4.10) as,  
$$
\frac{\Delta P}{P}\approx-D\Delta y
$$  

Table 4.3 shows the calculation of [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) for the three bonds introduced in Table 4.1. Estimating the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the NSC 4.10s of 05/15/2121 with Equation (4.10),  
$$
-{\frac{1}{99.9390}}{\frac{99.6990-100.1801}{0.02\%}}=24.1
$$  

Applying Equation (4.12), the percentage change in the price of the NSC bond for a decline in rates of 100 basis points, or $1\%$ , is $-24.1\times$ $(-1\%)=24.1\%$ Hence, a [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of 24.1 roughly means that a fall in rates of 100 basis points increases bond price by $24.1\%$ . This interpretation is only roughly correct because [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md), like Dv01, is based on the slope of the [price-rate curve](Price-Rate%20Curves.md) and, therefore, is a local measure of price change.

While traders tend to rely on Dv01, asset managers tend to rely on [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md). As in the market-making example of the previous section, traders typically want to ensure that the dollar changes in the value of [long and short positions](../Chapter%2013/Market%20Size%20and%20Participants.md) offset each other. Also, because the sizes of their positions can fluctuate rapidly, and because they typically borrow money to buy bonds, they tend to focus on dollar P&L rather than on [returns](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on fixed amounts of invested cash. Asset managers, in contrast, typically invest a slowly changing pool of funds and focus on rates of return. Looking at the durations in Table 4.3, an asset manager immediately sees that the NSC bond has the most [interest rate risk](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md), in that an [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in that bond loses $2.41\%$ for a 10-basis point increase in rates. An [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in the Treasury 1.625s of 11/15/2050 has slightly less risk, losing $2.36\%$ for that 10-basis-point increase in rates, while an [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in the Treasury 1.625s of 05/15/2026 has the least risk, losing only. $0.39\%$ in that scenario. The. asset manager can weigh these risks against expected [returns](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) and other factors in making a final [investment decision](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%201%20Introduction%20to%20Securities%20Trading%20and%20Markets.md)..  

This section concludes by noting the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is equal to the weighted sum of the durations of its component holdings, where the weights are percentages of [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) value. For example, the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) with $25\%$ of its value in the NSC bonds - with a [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of 24.1 - and $75\%$ of its value in the Treasury 1.625s of $05/15/2026-$ - with a [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of $3.9-$ .5 $25\%\times24.1+75\%\times3.9=8.95$ . The DV01 of a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is the sum of its component Dv01s, while the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is the value-weighted sum of its component durations, because Dv01 represents a change in price, while [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) represents a percentage change in price. A formal proof is in Appendix A4.1.
