# 4.8 THE BARBELL VERSUS THE BULLET  

This section presents a stylized example of [asset-liability management](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) for [defined-benefit pension liabilities](.md); applies the concepts of [duration and convexity](../Chapter%208/An%20Analytical%20Decomposition%20of%20Forward%20Rates.md) to [hedging](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) in this context, and explains how a choice arises between barbell and bullet asset portfolios, or, more generally, across asset portfolios with different convexities.  

Figure 4.10 shows the liabilities of a stylized defined-benefit pension. plan. Each black dot represents the total expected payment of the fund to. retirees over a six-month period. The first total payment, in six months, is $\$2$ million. Subsequent total payments increase, as more existing employ-. ees retire and become eligible for benefits, reaching a peak of. $\$4$ million in 10 years. From then on, deaths of retirees gradually reduce total payments,. which fall to zero in 60 years. The gray dots represent the present value of each total payment, where liabilities are discounted at the [HQM curve](Price-Rate%20Curves.md) as of mid-May 2021.  

The total present value of the liabilities in the figure is about $\$140\mathrm{mil}$ lion. For simplicity, assume that this pension fund is fully funded, so that the pension fund has $\$140$ million cash on hand. The [asset-liability management](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) problem of the fund, therefore, is to invest the $\$140$ million so as to be able to make good on pension liabilities over time, or even to earn some excess over those liabilities. Since discounting is done at the HQM corporate curve,. the [pension fund](../Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) would break even by realizing [investment returns](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Long%20Term%20Capital%20Management%20L.p.%20(a).md) equal to HQM rates. If the [pension fund](../Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) earned lower rates, likely, for example, if it were to invest in Treasuries, then there would not be enough cash available over the 60-year horizon to meet all of the pension obligations. And if the pension earned higher rates, perhaps by investing in stocks, then it would have more than enough to fulfill its pension obligations. In this case, however, there would be a significant risk that stocks perform relatively poorly over the period and leave the pension without enough funds to meet its obligations.

FIGURE 4.10 Liabilities of a Stylized Defined-Benefit [Pension Fund](../Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md). Present Values Are Computed by Discounting at the [HQM Curve](Price-Rate%20Curves.md), as of May 2021.  

Because many pension funds make future payment commitments in. line with [returns](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on corporate bonds, the considerations in the previous. paragraph lead many funds to invest a significant portion of their funds in corporate bonds. For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that all of the $\$140$ million of pension assets are invested in corporate bonds.. More specifically, it is assumed that the pension fund can invest in one or two of the Johnson $\&$ Johnson (JNJ) bonds listed in Table 4.6. As mentioned in Chapter 3, all of these bonds were issued by JNJ in August. 2020. For expository purposes, these bonds are referred to by their original. terms, which are not that different from their terms as of mid-May 2021. For example, the 0.55s of $09/1/2025$ are called the five-year bonds, while the 2.45s of 09/1/2060 are called the 40-year bonds. The durations and convexities in the table are all yield-based metrics.  

The [duration and convexity](../Chapter%208/An%20Analytical%20Decomposition%20of%20Forward%20Rates.md) of the pension liabilities, computed by a. parallel shift in the [HQM par rate curve](Price-Rate%20Curves.md), are 16.66 and 211.37, respectively.. To hedge against the risk that rates fall, which would increase the present. value of the liabilities, the [pension fund](../Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) decides to invest in an [asset portfolio](.md). with a [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of 16.66, the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the liabilities. But in which of the JNJ bonds should the fund invest?  

Perhaps the most straightforward answer is to invest in the 20-year. bonds, which have a [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of 15.56. With its assets invested in this bond, the fund would have an asset [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) equal to that of the bond, 15.56, and a liability [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md), given already, of 16.66. Were rates to fall by 100 basis points, then, along the lines of previous sections, assets would increase in value by approximately $15.56\%$ and liabilities by approximately $16.66\%$ The result is close to hedged, but not quite. On the initial [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) value of $\$140$ million, the present value of the liabilities would then exceed the. value of the assets by. $(16.66\%-15.56\%)\times\mathbb{\mathbb{S}}140$ million, or $1.1\%$ of value, or $\$1,540,000$

To clean up that hedge, the [pension fund](../Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) might use cash. Denote the. amount held in cash by. $M$ , so that the fund's remaining funds,. $\$140-M$ are invested in the 20-year bond. Then, as mentioned in Section 4.4, the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of this [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is the weighted average of its component durations. Note, too, that the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of cash equals zero: its present value always equals its amount, no matter how rates change. Therefore, setting the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of this [asset portfolio](.md) equal to the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the liabilities,.  
$$
{\frac{M}{140}}\times0+{\frac{140-M}{140}}\times15.56=16.66
$$  

Solving,e $M=-9.90$ , meaning that the [pension fund](../Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) would borrow $\$9.90$ million, or about. $7\%$ of the. $\$140$ million, and invest $\$140-(-9.90)=$ $\$149.90$ or about $107\%$ in the 20-year bond.  

The [asset portfolio](.md) just described hedges the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) risk of the liabilities. But how does the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of the [asset portfolio](.md) compare with the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of the liabilities? As mentioned in Section 4.5, the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is the weighted average of the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of its components. Here, with the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of cash equal to zero and the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of the 20-year bond equal to 141.49, the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of the [asset portfolio](.md) is,  
$$
{\frac{-9.90}{140}}\times0+{\frac{149.90}{140}}\times141.49=151.50
$$  

which is less than the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of the liabilities, given earlier as 211.37. Hence, this [asset portfolio](.md) results in the [pension fund](../Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) having an overall negatively convex position. Figure 4.11 graphs the. $\mathrm{P}\&\mathrm{L}$ of this [asset portfolio](.md) and of the liabilities, where the P&L of the bond is calculated as a shift in its yield, and the. $\mathrm{P}\&\mathrm{L}$ of the liabilities by parallel shifts in the HQM par. rate curve. As rates fall, the values of both the liabilities and the asset port-. folio increase, as envisioned by the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) hedge. Because of the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md). hedge, in fact, the values of both increase by about the same amount for rela-. tively small [rate changes](../Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md). But because the liabilities have a higher [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md),. the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the liabilities increases more as rates decline. Therefore, for large declines in rates, the increase in value of the liabilities is greater than the increase in value of the assets, which leaves the [pension fund](../Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) with a net loss in value.  

![](809c36d3a9e5895f6443c63c7e2182a308fe4cc83550bfdefa479e77d02b66f0.jpg)  
FIGURE 4.11 $\mathrm{P}\&\mathrm{L}$ of the [Pension Fund](../Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) Liabilities in Figure 4.10 and of a [Portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) Borrowing $\$9.90$ Million and Investing $\$149.90$ Million in the Johnson $\&$ Johnson 2.10s of 09/1/2040. The $\mathrm{P}\&\mathrm{L}$ of the Liabilities Is Computed Under a Parallel Shift of HQM Par Rates. The P&L of the Bond Is Computed by a Shift in Its Yield.  

As rates increase, the values of both the liabilities and the [asset portfolio](.md). fall, again as envisioned by the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) hedge. But because the liabilities. have a higher [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md), the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the liabilities falls more as rates. increase. Therefore, for large increases in rates, [the fall](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Fall%20of%20Bear%20Stearns%20Lost%20Opportunities%20Haunt%20Final%20Days%20of%20Bear%20Stearns;%20Executives%20Bickeredover%20Raising%20Cash%20Cutting%20Mortgages.md) in the value of the liabilities is less than [the fall](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Articles/The%20Fall%20of%20Bear%20Stearns%20Lost%20Opportunities%20Haunt%20Final%20Days%20of%20Bear%20Stearns;%20Executives%20Bickeredover%20Raising%20Cash%20Cutting%20Mortgages.md) in value of the assets, which, again, leaves the. [pension fund](../Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) with a net loss in value..  

The [pension fund](../Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) could manage this [negative convexity](../Chapter%2015/Mortgage%20Pricing%20Spreads%20and%20Duration.md) by adjusting its hedge as rates change. As rates fall, and the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the liabilities increases more than the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the assets, the fund could increase its asset [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) by borrowing more cash and buying more bonds. As rates rise, and the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the liabilities falls more than that of the assets, the fund could lower its asset [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) by selling bonds and paying off some of its borrowing. This solution is fine in theory and sometimes in practice, but it is costly in the sense of requiring potentially frequent [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) rebalancing.  

Another approach is to find an [asset portfolio](.md) that not only matches the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the liabilities, but that also has a [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) equal to or greater. than that of the liabilities. There are, of course, many such portfolios that. can be formed from cash and the JNJ bonds listed in Table 4.6. For discussion purposes, Table 4.7 lists the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) already discussed, along with two additional, two-asset portfolios.  

TABLE 4.7 Selected Portfolios of JNJ Bonds Listed in Table 4.6 That Match the [Duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the Liabilities in Figure 4.10, as of Mid-May 2021.

Each row gives the two assets in the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md); the proportion of value in each asset; the weighted-average yield of the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), with weights equal to the proportions of value; the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md); and the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of. the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). The weighted-average yield of the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is far from a perfect. measure of ex-ante [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) return, but will serve for the purposes of this. section. Cash, consistent with market levels at the time, is assumed to have a yield of $0.05\%$ . [Portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) [duration and convexity](../Chapter%208/An%20Analytical%20Decomposition%20of%20Forward%20Rates.md) equals the weighted average of the [duration and convexity](../Chapter%208/An%20Analytical%20Decomposition%20of%20Forward%20Rates.md) of the components, as explained earlier in the chapter.  

The first row of the table corresponds to the [asset portfolio](.md) already analyzed. Its [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) equals 16.66, which equals the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the liabilities, but its [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) is significantly less than 211, the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of the liabilities. The second row gives a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) invested in the five-year and 30-year bonds,. with the proportions such that the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the [asset portfolio](.md) matches that of the liabilities. The [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is 205.47, which is quite close to the 211.37 [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of the liabilities. The third row gives an asset. [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) that once again matches the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), this time by investing much more in cash and the residual in the 40-year bond. This [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) has a [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of 271.84, which exceeds that of the liabilities.  

The relative convexities of the asset portfolios in Table 4.7 illustrate the following general principle: among portfolios with the same [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md), the more spread out the cash flows of a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), the greater its [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md). All portfolios in the table are constructed to have the same [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md), but the first [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is essentially all in the 20-year bond. In the [asset-liability management](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) context, this [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is called a bullet [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md): the liability. cash flows, which are spread over many years, are being hedged by a single bond with matching [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md). The second [asset portfolio](.md) in the table is split. between five-year and 30-year bonds, while the third is split between cash -- essentially a zero-year bond - and 40-year bonds. These two [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) are. called barbell portfolios, because they are [hedging](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) liabilities using one bond. with less [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) than the liabilities and one bond with more.  

Matched-[duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) portfolios with cash flows that are more spread out have greater convexities because, as explained earlier, [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) is roughly linear in term, while [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) is quadratic. Consider a 10-year zero coupon bond at a yield of zero, which, according to Equations (4.28) and (4.33), has a [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of 10 and a [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of. $10\times10.5=105$ . By contrast, a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) with $50\%$ of its value in a five-year zero coupon bond and $50\%$ in a 15-year zero, using the same equations, also has a [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) 10, but a [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of $50\%$ times the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of the five-year zero, 22.5, plus $50\%$ times the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of the 15-year zero, 232.5, which equals 127.5. Because [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) is quadratic in term, the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of the 15-year zero dominates. Hence, the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) with the more spread-out cash flows - the one with the longest-term bond - has the greatest [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md).  

Given the calculations in Table 4.7, how should the [pension fund](../Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) choose. among the alternatives? Figure 4.12 graphs the net P&L of the liabilities and each of the asset portfolios. The net. $\mathrm{P}\&\mathrm{L}$ of the liabilities and the bullet [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), $-7\%$ in cash and $107\%$ in the 20-year bond, is clearly negatively. convex: it loses value whether rates fall or rise. The barbell [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) with. $25\%$ in the five-year bond and $75\%$ in the 30-year bond, which matches the. [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) and approximately matches the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of the liabilities, gives rise. to a net $\mathrm{P}\&\mathrm{L}$ that is very small over a wide range of rates. In other words, a [pension fund](../Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) with this [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) need not rebalance its [asset portfolio](.md) unless. rates fall significantly. Lastly, the barbell [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) with $31\%$ in cash and $69\%$ in the 40-year, gives rise to an overall, positively convex position. The combination of assets and liabilities gains value whether rates fall or rise.

FIGURE 4.12 Net P&L of the [Pension Fund](../Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) Liabilities in Figure 4.10 and the Asset Portfolios in Table 4.7. The $\mathrm{P}\&\mathrm{L}$ of the Liabilities Is Computed Under a Parallel Shift of HQM Par Rates. The P&L of the Bond Is Computed by a Shift in Its Yield.  

Does Figure 4.12 prove that the [pension fund](../Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) should always choose the most convex [asset portfolio](.md)? The answer is no. As mentioned in Section 4.6, evaluating P&L purely as a function of [changes in rates](../Chapter%203/Pl%20Attribution.md) does not account for the passage of time. As a rough proxy for return as time passes with rates unchanged, consider the weighted-average yields in Table 4.7, which fall with [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md). In other words, markets recognize the contribution of [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) to $\mathrm{P}\&\mathrm{L}$ as rates change, as shown in Figure 4.12, and, therefore, offer. lower yields for highly convex portfolios. As a result, a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) with relatively low [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) and relatively high yield underperforms if rates change a lot but outperforms if rates stay about the same. By contrast, a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). with relatively high [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) and relatively low yield outperforms if rates change a lot but underperforms if rates stay about the same..  

Figure 4.13 illustrates the trade-off between yield and [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) by graphing the yields of the JNJ bonds from Table 4.6 against their durations. The curve has a concave shape, meaning that any line connecting two points on the curve is below the curve. Now, in the context of this graph, compare the second [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) from Table 4.7 - the barbell of the five-year and 30-year bonds - versus the bullet 20-year bond [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). The barbell [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), with a [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of 16.66 and a weighted-average yield of. $2.32\%$ corresponds to the point on the dotted line at a [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of 16.66. By the concavity of the yield-[duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) curve, this yield is very much below the yield of the 20-year bond, which has a similar [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md).4 More generally, the concavity of the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md)-yield curve implies that the weighted-average yield on portfolios with more spread-out component bonds, which are more convex portfolios, is lower than the yield of bullet portfolios and also of less spread-out - less convex - portfolios. Chapter 8 demonstrates more formally how the shape of the [term structure](../Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) ensures that the benefits of [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) are fairly offset by lower return.

Given the discussion in the last several paragraphs, a [pension fund](../Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) man-. ager who decides to match the [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) of assets and liabilities has to decide whether to trade yield for [positive convexity](Convexity.md). An [asset portfolio](.md) with a rela-. tively low yield but [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) exceeding that of the liabilities does not have. to be rebalanced often to avoid losses, does relatively well when rates move a lot, and does relatively poorly when rates do not move much. An asset port-. folio with a relatively high yield but [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) less than that of the liabilities has to be rebalanced often to avoid losses, does relatively poorly when rates move a lot, and does relatively well when rates do not move much. To summarize, then, the choice actually depends on whether rates will change by much or not, that is, on [future interest rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Rate.md) volatility!.  

# Key-Rate, Partial, and Forward-Bucket '01s and Durations  

The assumption in Chapter 4 that changes in the entire [term structure](../Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) can be described by one interest rate factor may be convenient and appropriate in certain situations, but applications with exposures across the [term structure](../Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) require more realistic foundations. Consider a life insurance com-. pany that has liabilities spread out over many years in the future. The insurer could make assumptions about how rates across the [term structure](../Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) typically vary with the 10-year [par rate](../Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) and then hedge all of its liabilities by buying 10-year bonds. But what if, over a particular period, the 30-year rate falls and the 10-year rate stays the same? The present value of liabilities would. increase, asset value would be unchanged, and the insurer would experience a net loss in value.  

Given that a one-factor framework cannot reliably describe [rate changes](../Chapter%207/Profit%20and%20Loss%20Attribution%20with%20an%20OAS.md). across the [term structure](../Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md), market participants have pursued three broad strategies. First, build a multi-factor [term structure](../Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) model, based on a combination of data and [market analysis](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/II.%20The%20Roles%20of%20Banks%20and%20Derivative%20Markets%20in%20Resolving%20Problems%20Inherent%20in%20Debt%20Contracts/Class%203-%20Financial%20Intermediation%20and%20Delegated%20Loan%20Monitoring%20,%20Intro%20to%20Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Restructuring/Gordon%20Bargain%20Stores%20B.md). Many active [hedge funds](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) and asset managers, who build such models for [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) purposes anyway, pursue. this path for [hedging](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) as well. The Gauss+ model presented in Chapter 9 is an example of this approach. Second, hedge based on empirical analyses of. relationships across rates of various terms. Examples of this approach are given in Chapter 6. Third, adopt a robust approach to [hedging](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md), which per-. forms well regardless of how the [term structure](../Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) evolves but which leaves little room for subjective views and gives no guidance as to [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) deci-. sions. Many asset-liability managers and market makers, who do not see. themselves in the business of taking views on [term structure](../Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) movements, pursue this path, which is the subject of this chapter..  

The extreme of robust approaches to [hedging](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) is immunization, that is,.   
[hedging](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) away the risk of every single [cash flow](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md). An example would be buying.   
eight zero coupon bonds to fund eight semesters of college tuition payments.  

No matter what happens to [interest rates](../Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) and the [term structure](../Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md), the maturing zero coupon bonds will fund the assumed payments. Immunization is not practical, however, in many institutional contexts. An insurance company has too many liabilities on too many future dates for each of them to be funded - and therefore hedged - individually. Aside from the operational costs of such a program, the transaction costs of buying relatively small quantities of so many different [fixed income securities](../../../Clippings/Bond%20Equivalent%20Yield%20(BEY)%20-%20Definition,%20Formula,%20and%20Example.md) is likely to be prohibitive.  

Practical approaches to robust [hedging](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md), therefore, incorporate enough factors to ensure acceptable performance under a wide range of [term structure](../Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) scenarios but limit the number of factors to maintain tractability and contain transaction costs. The three approaches described in this. chapter - key-rate $^{\ '}O1s$ and durations, partial. $^{\mathrm{~,~}01s\mathrm{~-~}}$ and [forward-bucket](../Chapter%205/Forward-Bucketo1s.md) $^{\ '}01s$ , have proved popular as striking a sensible balance between [hedging](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md). effectiveness and practicality or cost. The final section of the chapter briefly. connects [multi-factor exposures](../Chapter%205/Multi-Factor%20Exposures%20and%20Portfolio%20Volatility.md) with [portfolio volatility](../../../Financial%20Engineering/2.%20Forwards,%20Swaps,%20Futures,%20and%20Options.md)..
