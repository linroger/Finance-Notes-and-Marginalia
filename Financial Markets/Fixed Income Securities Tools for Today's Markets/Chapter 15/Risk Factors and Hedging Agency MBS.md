# 15.9 RISK FACTORS AND HEDGING AGENCY MBS  

Participants in [agency MBS](The%20Mortgage%20Market%20in%20the%20United%20States.md) face and have to manage a number of risks: [interest rate risk](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md), which includes [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) and volatility risks; [mortgage spread risk](.md); [prepayment risk](.md); and [credit risk](../../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md). [Interest rate risk](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) is discussed extensively in earlier chapters of the book. Mortgages are clearly exposed to the risk that rates rise and fall, and, as described before, exhibit [negative convexity](Mortgage%20Pricing%20Spreads%20and%20Duration.md). Furthermore, negatively convex positions are also short [interest rate volatility](../Chapter%207/Fixed%20Income%20Versus%20Equity%20Derivatives.md).14  

[Mortgage spread risk](.md) refers to the risk of changes in the spread between mortgage rates and benchmark rates, that is, Treasury or swap rates. If an MBS is hedged by selling Treasury [futures](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) and then mortgage spreads increase, the MBS falls in value relative to the [Treasury hedge](../Chapter%204/Hedging%20a%20Century%20Bond%20Part%20I.md) and the overall position loses money. If, on the other hand, one MBS is hedged by another, perhaps a TBA, then changes in value due to mortgage spreads can offset. [Prepayment risk](.md), following earlier discussions, is the risk that prepayments are higher than anticipated for premium mortgages or lower than anticipated for discount mortgages. Finally, the [credit risk](../../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md) from [agency MBS](The%20Mortgage%20Market%20in%20the%20United%20States.md), the risk of [interest and principal](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Notes%20on%20Currency%20Swaps.md) loss due to homeowner default, is borne by the agencies that guarantee the underlying mortgages or the MBS.  

Various groups of market participants face these risks in different permutations. Originators, who make mortgage loans in order to sell them into MBS, are exposed to pipeline risk. Originators offer firm rates to borrowers, called rate locks, but it then takes time to close or complete the mortgage. deal. A possible hedge against the risk that rates rise before the mortgage. can be sold is to short Treasuries or pay fixed in swaps, with hedge ratios calculated as OADs to account for [prepayment risk](.md). But this strategy has. three problems. First, borrowers can walk away from rate locks at their. discretion. While a deal might not close for many reasons, borrowers do. tend to abandon offers when rates subsequently decline, while they tend. to close on mortgages when rates subsequently increase. Accurate [hedging](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md). of pipeline risk, therefore, has to account for the exercise of this borrower. option. Second, because mortgages are negatively convex, [hedging](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) them with.  

positively convex Treasuries or swaps leaves an overall negatively convex and short volatility position. One solution is to buy short-term payer swaptions to manage [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) and to buy longer-term swaption straddles to hedge the volatility.15 Third, because mortgage values and this borrower option depend on prevailing mortgage rates, rather than on Treasury or swap rates, hedges with Treasuries or swaps are subject to [mortgage spread risk](.md).  

An alternative hedge of [originator pipeline risk](.md) is to sell TBAs rather than Treasuries or swaps. [Prepayment models](Prepayment%20Modeling.md) are still needed to calculate hedge ratios, and the problem of modeling rate-lock optionality remain. But because TBAs are also negatively convex and short volatility, selling them can offset the [negative convexity](Mortgage%20Pricing%20Spreads%20and%20Duration.md) and short volatility properties of the mortgages being originated. In that case, swaptions are necessary only to address any residual exposures. Furthermore, because both TBAs and the mortgages being originated clearly depend on mortgage spreads, that risk can be mitigated by the TBA hedge as well..  

Originators that hedge pipeline risk by selling TBAs have another decision to make when the originated pools are ready for sale. If the pools are significantly more valuable than TBA prices, the originator can buy back the TBA hedge and sell the pools in the specified pool market. If the pools are about as valuable as TBA prices, the originator can deliver the pools into the short TBA hedges. And if the pools are worth somewhat more than TBA prices, there is a trade-off of value and [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md): the pools may be worth somewhat more if sold as [specified pools](Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md), but they can be sold with more [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) in the [TBA market](Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md).16.  

Mortgage servicers lose revenue when mortgage rates decline and homeowners refinance. This effect tends to dominate the increase in value of the remaining servicing flows due to discounting at lower rates. Mortgage servicing rights, therefore, usually have significant negative [duration](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md). They are also negatively convex. Their [interest rate sensitivity](../Chapter%2011/Forward%20Bond%20Yield.md) increases as rates increase: from very negative at low rates, when homeowners are prepaying fast, to less negative at high rates, when homeowners are prepaying slowly. One possible hedge of servicing revenue is to buy Treasuries or receive fixed in swaps. The determination of hedge ratios requires a prepayment model, of course, but the resulting, overall position is negatively convex, short volatility, and subject to [mortgage spread risk](.md). The alternative of [hedging](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) by buying TBAs is not as appealing a solution as it is for originators. True, buying TBAs across the stack of coupons can increase the effectiveness of prepayment [hedging](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md).. And true, buying TBAs against servicing rights hedges [mortgage spread risk](.md).. But with both mortgage servicing rights and long TBA positions negatively. convex and short volatility, the overall "hedged" position is even more negatively convex and short volatility. If that result is unacceptable from a [risk management](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) perspective, swaptions can be bought - at a cost - to flatten out the exposure.  

As mentioned earlier in the chapter, some servicers are also originators, and servicing and origination businesses, at least to some extent, hedge each other. It might be cheapest, at least in theory, for entities with both businesses to rely on this operational hedge and hedge only [residual risk](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Residual%20Risk%20of%20Options%20Gamma%20Vega%20and%20Volatil.md) with Treasuries or swaps, TBAs, and swaptions. In practice, however, organizational efficiencies might lead each business to hedge its risk independently. In that case, a middle ground might be to save on transaction costs by crossing [hedging](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) trades internally.  

The various market participants that invest in mortgages can decide which risks to bear and which risks to hedge. A mortgage exchange-traded fund is likely to buy MBS and take all of the associated risks, in the expectation of earning commensurate return. A more actively managed mortgage [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) might hedge out [interest rate risk](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) with Treasuries or swaps, and even [negative convexity](Mortgage%20Pricing%20Spreads%20and%20Duration.md) and volatility with swaptions, but keep [mortgage spread risk](.md) and [prepayment risk](.md), possibly to earn appropriate compensation for bearing those risks over time, or possibly to take advantage of perceived skill in timing exposures to those risks. Finally, a relative value mortgage desk might bet on prepayment speeds alone, essentially depending on its prepayment model outperforming the market consensus and implied [pricing](../Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md). This strategy is most likely implemented by buying relatively cheap [specified pools](Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md) and selling relatively rich TBAs, or vice versa, or by trading one TBA coupon against another in the stack.  

Last but not least are the agencies. They manage the [default risk](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md) arising from their guarantees in two ways. First, they collect g-fees that are designed to be sufficient, in aggregate, to make up for experienced losses. Second, agencies sell off some of their [default risk](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives%20183.md) to the private sector through [credit risk transfer](../../../Financial%20Engineering/A%20Primer%20on%20Structured%20Finance.md) securities, which are discussed presently. The extent to which the agencies bear other mortgage risks depends on the method by which the MBS are issued. In lender swap transactions, which are the most common, an agency exchanges mortgage loans from originators for MBS made up of those loans. The loans move directly into a trust backing the MBS without ever residing on the agency's balance sheet. Therefore, in this kind of issuance, all risks (other than default) remain with the originator. In [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) [securitization](../../../Financial%20Engineering/10.%20Other%20Topics%20in%20Quantitative%20Finance.md) transactions, by contrast, an agency buys mortgages for its own [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), packages them into MBS, and sells those MBS in the [secondary market](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md). In this method of issuance, the agency bears [interest rate risk](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md), [prepayment risk](.md), and [mortgage spread risk](.md) from the time the mortgages are purchased until the time they are sold through MBs. Along the lines of the earlier discussion about private originators, an agency can hedge these risks by selling Treasuries or swaps, or by selling TBAs, and by supplementing these hedges with the purchases of swaptions. Also, like other originators, agencies can decide whether to buy back TBA hedges and sell originated pools in the [specified pools](Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md) market or to deliver originated pools into their short TBA hedges.  

This section concludes with a further observation about the TBA and [specified pools](Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md) markets. On the one hand, the TBA delivery option means that TBA prices track those of the least valuable pools. But on the other hand, from a [primary market](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) that produces a huge number of distinct pools, the TBA delivery option creates extremely liquid [secondary market](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md) trading in a handful of [TBA contracts](Dollar%20Rolls.md). This [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) allows market participants to hedge their specified pool exposures with TBAs; that is, the [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) of the. [TBA market](Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md) easily compensates for any [basis risk](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md) arising from differences between changes in specified pool prices and changes in TBA prices. Fur-. thermore, the [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) of the [TBA market](Tba%20and%20Specified%20Pools%20Markets.md) is so attractive that many pools are, in fact, physically delivered - and thus sold - through [TBA contracts](Dollar%20Rolls.md),. despite relatively low TBA prices due to the delivery option, and despite the. general [preference](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Utility%20Indices.md) of [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) users to unwind [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) hedges and to trade physical or cash product with their regular business counterparties.
