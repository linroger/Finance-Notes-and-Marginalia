# 0.4 MONETARY POLICY WITH ABUNDANTRESERVES  

To introduce the roles of the [[Fed Fund Futures|Federal Reserve system]] or "[[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]]" as a modern central bank, Table O.4 shows its pre-crisis balance sheet, as of December 2007. One role, the creation and maintenance of a widely accepted national [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]], is achieved by purchasing government bonds with that [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]. The [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] of the United States is comprised of green bills labeled as liabilities of the Federal Reserve, that is, as "Federal Reserve Notes." In terms of the balance sheet, therefore, outstanding [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] is a liability and [[US Markets|Treasury securities]] are assets. Put another way, [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] is "backed" by government bonds. As shown in the table, $\$773.9$ billion of currency outstanding was about $83\%$ of Federal Reserve liabilities.

A second role of the central bank is to provide [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] to banks under short-term distress. As mentioned earlier, bank assets, like loans, are relatively illiquid, while bank liabilities, like deposits or short-term borrowings. from other [[Financial Markets and Institutions Lecture Notes|financial institutions]], may be due immediately. Therefore, a bank. may find itself solvent but illiquid, that is, with assets of sufficient value to pay off its liabilities but without enough cash on hand to meet its immediate obligations. In these situations, a bank can borrow from [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] through the [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|discount window]] on any acceptable collateral. The [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|discount window]]. borrowings of a well-managed bank are expected to be infrequent and of relatively limited [[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|duration]].  

The third role discussed here, as set out in the Federal Reserve Act, is to "maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates...so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate [[The Economist Margin Call of the Wild|long-term interest rates]]." Despite the three objectives, by the way, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] is often said to have a "dual mandate" of full employment and low [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]]. In any case, two points are made before proceeding:  

1. To ensure that banks have the resources to honor all requests to withdraw deposits that they are likely to receive, banks have been required to maintain cash and reserves, which are deposits held at a Federal Reserve bank. Until 2008, banks did not earn interest on their reserve balances.18   
2. [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|The Fed]] sets the total amount of reserves in the [[Class Slide 3 Financial Intermediation and Delegated Monitoring|banking system]]. To add to reserves, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] might buy a Treasury bond from a bank. The bank's account at its Federal Reserve Bank is credited with the purchase  

price -- which increases bank reserves and the liabilities of [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] - and. the Treasury bond is added to the assets of [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]]. [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|The Fed]] can also add to reserves by lending money to a bank through a repurchase agreement or repo.19 The money is credited to the bank's account at [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]], which is a reserve liability of [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]], and the loan obligation is added. to [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]]'s assets. To reduce reserves, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] can do the opposite of. these two transactions, that is, sell a bond to a bank or borrow money from a bank through a repo. In light of this discussion, the quantity of Treasury assets and net repo assets on [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]]'s balance sheet enter into the determination of the total amount of reserves in the [[Class Slide 3 Financial Intermediation and Delegated Monitoring|banking system]].  

Before the [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]] of 2007-2009, reserves were scarce in the sense that banks traded reserves among themselves in the interbank [[Fed Fund Futures|fed funds]] market. Banks that needed reserves to satisfy their reserve requirements borrowed [[Fed Fund Futures|fed funds]], while banks that had excess reserves, on which they did not earn interest, loaned [[Fed Fund Futures|fed funds]] at the market-determined [[Fed Fund Futures|fed funds]] rate. In this setting, if [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] wanted to ease monetary conditions, to stimulate the economy (i.e., growth was too low and [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] not a threat), it would add reserves to the [[Class Slide 3 Financial Intermediation and Delegated Monitoring|banking system]], which - by increasing supply relative to demand in the market for reserves - would decrease [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the fed]] funds rate and likely increase the volume of bank loans to commercial enterprises. Similarly, if [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] wanted to tighten monetary conditions, to slow the economy (e.g., growth was too inflationary), it would remove reserves from the system, which would increase [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the fed]] funds rate and likely decrease bank loans to commercial enterprises. Finally, the means by which [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] changed reserves were called open market operations and consisted almost exclusively. of lending and borrowing money through [[Class Slides On Repurchase Agreements|repurchase agreements]].  

In response to the [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]] and ensuing [[HKS The Banking Industry|Great Recession]], [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] tried to stimulate the economy as just described, by reducing [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the fed]] funds rate from $5.25\%$ in September 2007 to a range of between. $0\%$ and $0.25\%$ by December 2008. But having reduced [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] to nearly zero and wanting to stimulate the economy even more forcefully, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] began what became known as [[Negative Rates and Qe in Europe and Japan|quantitative easing]] $(\mathcal{Q}E)$ : it purchased great quantities of US [[US Markets|Treasury securities]] and "[[The Mortgage Market in the United States|agency MBS]]," which are MBS issued by government agencies and GSEs. At the start of the program, purchases of MBS directly eased stresses arising from the overleveraged positions in mortgages and mortgage products that were at the heart of the crisis. Experts do not agree, however, on the mechanism by which the subsequent massive purchases of both Treasuries and MBS were to stimulate the economy, although  

possibilities include lowering intermediate- and [[The Economist Margin Call of the Wild|long-term interest rates]].   
(rather than just [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the fed]] funds rate); pushing investors out of relatively safe.   
Treasuries and [[The Mortgage Market in the United States|agency MBS]] and into riskier products like corporate bonds.   
and loans; and flooding banks with reserves. In fact, the chairman of the.   
Fed at the time said a few years later that "the problem with QE is that it works in practice, but it doesn't work in theory."20.  

Figure O.13 shows the composition of the asset side of [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]]'s balance. sheet from June 2006 to June 2021. Note that the total of Fed assets is often referred to by market participants simply as [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]]'s "balance sheet." In any case, during the [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]] itself, from 2007 to 2009, assets were elevated by expanded repo lending, lending through the [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|discount window]],. loans through emergency facilities that [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] put in place at the time, and through swap lines, through which [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] lends US dollars to foreign central banks, collateralized by foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]. While small in hindsight, this bal-. ance sheet expansion before QE was unprecedented, increasing from about $\$900$ billion at the start of 2007 to over. $\$2$ trillion by the end of 2008.. From then, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] fully engaged in QE by purchasing Treasuries and [[The Mortgage Market in the United States|agency MBS]], and the balance sheet grew dramatically. By the end of 2014, however, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] decided that [[US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007–2011)|economic conditions]] had improved enough to discontinue further stimulus. It stopped buying new assets, though it continued to. roll over principal repayments from its holdings. From December 2015 to summer 2019, it raised the target [[Fed Fund Futures|Fed funds]] rate from a range of $0\%$ to $0.25\%$ to a range of $2.25\%$ to $2.50\%$ and, in what was named the "normalization" of the balance sheet, began allowing assets to decline with principal repayments. [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|The Fed]] was clear to point out, however, that the balance sheet would not decline to anywhere near its size before the [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]], because, as explained later, post-crisis [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] requires greater levels of reserves. Along these lines, in summer 2019, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] resumed the reinvestment of principal payments to maintain the size of the balance sheet. Then, in response to turmoil in the repo market in September 2019, further described later, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] started growing the balance sheet again. [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|The Fed]] also judged that "implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted [[War Economies and Hyperinflation|inflation]] pressures" warranted lowering rates and reduced [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] funds target range to $1.50\%$ to $1.75\%$ by November 2019. Finally, with the onset of the COvID pandemic and economic shutdowns, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] reduced rates back to the range of between $0\%$ and $0.25\%$ and aggressively bought Treasuries and MBs. As of June 2021, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]]'s balance sheet stood at $\$8.25$ trillion, more than nine times its size before the [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]].

QE not only increased the size of [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]]'s balance sheet but also changed its nature in a way that necessitated a new approach to implementing [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]]. This is best described in terms of the liability side of the balance sheet, which is shown in Figure O.14 for three dates: the end of 2007, before the [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]]; the end of 2019, before the pandemic; and, most recently, the end of the second quarter of 2021. At the end of 2007, consistent with the pre-crisis implementation of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]], about $2\%$ of [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]]'s liabilities were bank reserves, and reserves were scarce. After years of QE, however, with Fed asset purchases adding to bank reserves, bank reserves rose to $37\%$ of Fed liabilities by the end of 2019 and $43\%$ by June 2021. Reserves had become abundant, and banks essentially stopped borrowing from and lending reserves to each other.21 Consequently, in this new regime of [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|abundant reserves]], [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] could no longer influence [[Volatility and Convexity|short-term rates]] by adding to or subtracting reserves from the [[Class Slide 3 Financial Intermediation and Delegated Monitoring|banking system]].  

[[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|The Fed]] currently sets [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] through two administrative rates,. the interest on reserve balances (IORB) and the reverse repo facility (RRP) rate. The IORB is the rate that [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] pays banks on their reserve deposits.. Focusing on overnight, safe rates, that is, putting aside spreads due to longer terms, riskier investments, and fees, the IORB fixes the rate at which banks are willing to borrow and lend. No bank would borrow at a rate above the IORB: it would be less costly to use reserves and sacrifice earnings at the IORB. And no bank would lend at a rate below the IORB: it would be more profitable to keep reserves on deposit and earn the IORB.22.

If banks were the only participants in money markets, then setting the. IORB would set overnight, safe rates in the system. But nonbanks with funds to lend might very well lend at rates below the IORB. First, only banks hold reserves and, therefore, only banks can lend to [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] directly at the IORB. Second, because of post-crisis regulations, discussed later, banks are not willing to accept deposits from all comers and then hold those funds as their own reserves at [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]]. Therefore, other significant market participants, particularly [[Breaking the Buck|money market funds]], might very well lend funds at rates below the IORB. To prevent these lenders from pushing market rates below Fed targets, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] offers to pay a minimum rate to these participants through its RRP. More specifically, through the RRP, [[Breaking the Buck|money market funds]] and some other entities can lend money to [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]], taking [[US Markets|Treasury securities]] as collateral, at [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]]'s administered RRP rate.23 It has turned out, in fact, that the facility has had to grow very large and very quickly to keep rates in the. Fed's policy range. Figure O.14 shows that, as of June 2021, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]]'s repo. liabilities of $\$1.3$ trillion constituted $16\%$ of [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]]'s total liabilities..  

Putting these pieces together, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] sets rates in the regime of abundant. reserves as follows: [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] sets a target range for the market-determined [[Fed Fund Futures|fed funds]] rate; it sets the IORB to determine the rate at which banks are willing to borrow and lend; and it sets the RRP rate as a floor to the rate at which [[Breaking the Buck|money market funds]] and others will lend. At the time of this writing, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the fed]] funds target range is between $0\%$ and $0.25\%$ ; the RRP rate is $0.05\%$ ; and the IORB is $0.15\%$ . This means of implementing [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] has been. successful in that the weighted-average of [[Fed Fund Futures|fed funds]] transactions has most recently been between $0.06\%$ and $0.10\%$  

Policy implementation with [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|abundant reserves]] has not been as success-. ful, however, with respect to banks responding to market conditions with-. out Fed assistance. Put another way, it has not been clear at what level reserves really are abundant. In mid-September 2019, reserves dropped by about $9\%$ somewhat suddenly, from a variety of causes, including corporate tax payments and the settlement of new Treasury issues, both of which move funds from banks to the government. Banks might have been expected,. with their [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|abundant reserves]], to supply funds to any market participant needing funds. But that did not happen. Instead, in the ensuing scramble. for funds, when [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]]'s target range was between $2\%$ and $2.25\%$ , the transaction-weighted repo rate on a particular day averaged $5.25\%$ , and one trade was done at $10\%$ . As mentioned earlier, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] responded swiftly by adding reserves, but the episode demonstrated that the determination of. the quantity of reserves in a system of [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|abundant reserves]] was not necessarily straightforward.  

The reasons that reserves proved inadequate were traced to the interactions of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] with bank regulation. First, since the [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]], banks have been subject to a [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products|leverage]] ratio, which requires that capital equal a minimum fraction of assets, regardless of the risk of those assets. In particular, reserves at [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]], which are safer than any other instrument in the system, and repo lending on [[US Markets|Treasury securities]], which is extremely safe, are now both subject to capital requirements. Second, since the [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]], banks must hold enough [[Liquidity Management and Currentregulatory Iss|high-quality liquid assets]] $(H Q L A)$ to meet certain scenarios of cash withdrawals and funding needs. Furthermore, while [[US Markets|Treasury securities]] can be used to meet HQLA requirements, there appears to be a bank examiner [[Utility Indices|preference]] for reserves. Third, a stigma remains for banks that have daylight overdrafts, that is, temporary negative balances at Fed accounts that have to be resolved by the end of the day. Returning to September 2019, then, banks were not willing to make additional repo loans, despite the relatively high rates available, because the loans would increase assets and capital requirements; use reserves; and risk daylight overdrafts.24  

A similar episode occurred in March 2020. News of the COvID pandemic and economic shutdowns resulted in disorder in Treasury markets,. manifested through high costs of trading and high spreads between otherwise similar securities. These disturbances were much more severe than those in September 2019, but banks again seemed unwilling to use their resources,. and [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] again intervened by reducing [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the fed]] funds target range, offering unlimited repo loans, purchasing Treasuries and MBS, and temporarily excluding reserves, Treasuries, and Treasury repo from [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products|leverage]] ratio calculations.25 As a more permanent response to the episodes of both September 2019 and March 2020, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] instituted a standing repo facility (SRF) in July 2021, through which primary dealers and bank counterparties can borrow money overnight from [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] on government-backed collateral. To discourage the use of the facility except under stressed conditions, the borrowing rate is set above market rates. At the time of this writing, with the RRP rate at $0.05\%$ and the IORB at $0.15\%$ , the rate on the SRF is $0.25\%$  

Several policy issues arise with QE and the implementation of [[The Economist Regime Change|monetary policy]] in a regime of [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|abundant reserves]]. First, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] was established and has traditionally accepted deposits only from banks. The idea was that the public deposits funds into banks, and banks decide to whom to make loans. In other words, the private [[HKS The Banking Industry|banking]] sector was responsible for capital allocation decisions. [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|The Fed]] has always held some quantity of government bonds, of course, because, in the current monetary system, as explained earlier, government bonds are the assets against which circulate the liability of central bank [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]. But the purchase of much greater quantities of Treasuries - [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] has fallen to only. $26\%$ of Fed liabilities - and the. purchase of MBs by [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]], are effectively capital allocation decisions. Furthermore, the acceptance by [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] of large deposits from the public through the RRP has disintermediated banks as well. A second policy issue is that the existence of the RRP may encourage the public, in a crisis, to withdraw funds from banks and buy money market fund shares, to be deposited in the RRP. While withdrawing money from banks in cash has always been an option during crises, before the RRP this was very inconvenient for large sums. Third, to the extent that there is some limit on the size of a central bank's balance sheet, maintaining a large balance sheet in relatively normal times limits room for action in future times of stress. Fourth, [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] is now paying banks interest on their reserves, which it was not doing before 2008..  

This can be viewed as a cost to taxpayers when, for example, the Treasury is. borrowing through three-month T-bills -- and [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] is investing some of its assets in those same T-bills -- at five or six basis points, while [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] is borrowing from banks through reserves at 15 basis points. And this issue could become more acute when [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] eventually increases rates by increasing the IORB. In fact, one of the reasons that the Treasury has been keeping more. of its cash balances or deposits at [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] is to avoid the situation in which Treasury holds stores of cash as deposits at banks, earning a relatively low rate of interest, while the banks are depositing those fund at [[Monetary Policy with Abundantreserves|the Fed]] and earning the IORB.26 Figure O.14 shows that Treasury deposits have grown. to about $11\%$ of Fed liabilities.
