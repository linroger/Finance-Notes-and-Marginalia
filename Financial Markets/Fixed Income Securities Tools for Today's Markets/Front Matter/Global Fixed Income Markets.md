# 0.1 GLOBAL FIXED INCOME MARKETS  

[[A Practical Guide to Bonds and Swaps|Fixed income markets]] are large and global. Figure O.1 shows the outstand-. ing amounts of [[Analysis of Fixed Income Securities|debt securities]], by residence of issuer. [[Analysis of Fixed Income Securities|Debt securities]] are. instruments designed to be traded, like bonds issued by corporations or by governments. Grouping by residence of issuer means, for example, that US. Treasury bonds held by [[People's Bank of China (PBoC)|China's central bank]] are included in the total for the United States. As of March 2021, the global total of outstanding debt. securities was about $\$123$ trillion. For reference, the total capitalization of. global equity markets at the time was $\$110$ trillion, although [[Hedge Fund Strategies|stock market]]. values are significantly more volatile.  

Figure O.1 shows that the five largest issuers, in terms of amounts out-. standing, are in the United States, the Eurozone, China, Japan, and the. United Kingdom, which together comprise nearly. $90\%$ of the total. The Eurozone includes countries that both belong to the European Union (EU) and use the euro as a national [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]. Some individual members of the Eurozone, indicated with asterisks in the figure, are significant issuers of. [[Analysis of Fixed Income Securities|debt securities]] on their own. Note that the figure displays their amounts. outstanding with gray bars, but their contributions to the cumulative total are included once, with the Eurozone total..  

Figure O.2 decomposes debt outstanding in the five largest regions by sector. The large fraction of [[Global Fixed Income Markets|government debt]] in Japan reflects decades of government [[Understanding Debt Crises and Their Management|borrowing and spending]] intended to stimulate the economy.. The fraction of [[Global Fixed Income Markets|government debt]] in the United States, the Eurozone, and the United Kingdom is lower, at about. $50\%$ , but has increased significantly since the [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]] of 2007-2009. Corporations in the United States are relatively more likely to issue bonds directly to the public, while corporations in the Eurozone, Japan, and the United Kingdom are relatively more likely to borrow funds from intermediaries, like banks, which, in turn, raise money from the public. While Figure O.2 includes the breakdown for debt in China, the relatively large role of the government in financial and nonfinancial enterprises makes comparisons across sectors and regions less meaningful.

Table O.1 and Figure O.3 show the [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]] of outstanding interest rate [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] across the globe. These [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] are described in later chapters, but [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] essentially allow market participants to take positions on [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]], whether for [[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|hedging]], [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]], or speculative purposes. The notional amount of a derivative is used to calculate the cash flows that one of the derivative's counterparties pays the other. Adding together all [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]], however, can significantly overstate market size. First, the largest market participants, namely dealers, tend to be simultaneously long and short nearly identical [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]]. Second, options are actually equivalent to only fractions of the [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]] of their [[Rate and Price Trees|underlying securities]]. Later chapters elaborate on these points, but, for the purposes of this [[Overview of Financial Markets|overview]], this table and figure are reported in [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]].  

While [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] may trade in a particular locality, there is no sense in which [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] are issued in one place or another: local regulations aside, any entity, residing anywhere, can enter into these [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] contracts. A typical classification, therefore, is the [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] in which the cash flows of the derivative are denominated. The first two columns of Table O.1 show [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]] for swaps, options, and [[EURIBOR Forward Rate Agreements and Futures|forward rate agreements]]. Most of the outstanding amounts are denominated in US Dollars (USD) and Euro (EUR). The quantities in the table hint at the overstatement of market size by notional amount: if the sizes of the markets for these UsD [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] were really $\$150$ trillion, they would be larger than the combined size of all [[Global Fixed Income Markets|global debt securities]] markets. The second two columns of the table show the [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]] of standardized, exchange-traded [[Chapter 12 - Hedging with Interest Rate Futures|interest rate futures]] and options. Amounts outstanding of UsD-denominated contracts are by far the greatest, with those denominated in British Pounds (GBP) and EUR making up most of the rest of the overall market.

Finally, Figure O.3 gives the notional amount of credit default swaps (CDS) outstanding. These are discussed in detail in Chapter 14, but, roughly speaking, CDS allow investors to take positions that are equivalent to lever-. aged long or short positions in bonds with [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]]. The figure divides the market into credit sectors: CDS can be written on nonfinancial com-. panies, financial companies, sovereigns, [[Asset Backed Commercial Paper Understanding the Risks|asset-backed]] securities (ABS), and [[Fremont Financial Corp. (b)|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBs). Within each sector, a [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|single-name CDS]] references a single credit (e.g., the government of Spain), while an index. CDS references a [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] of credits (e.g., 25 European financial companies). Note that the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]] is much smaller in notional amount than the [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] markets depicted in Table O.1.
