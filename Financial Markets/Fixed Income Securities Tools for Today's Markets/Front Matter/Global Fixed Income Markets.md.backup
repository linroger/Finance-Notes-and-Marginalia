# 0.1 GLOBAL FIXED INCOME MARKETS  

[Fixed income markets](../../../Financial%20Engineering/A%20Practical%20Guide%20to%20Bonds%20and%20Swaps.md) are large and global. Figure O.1 shows the outstand-. ing amounts of [debt securities](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md), by residence of issuer. [Debt securities](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) are. instruments designed to be traded, like bonds issued by corporations or by governments. Grouping by residence of issuer means, for example, that US. Treasury bonds held by [China's central bank](../../../International%20Finance/China%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves/People's%20Bank%20of%20China%20(PBoC).md) are included in the total for the United States. As of March 2021, the global total of outstanding debt. securities was about $\$123$ trillion. For reference, the total capitalization of. global equity markets at the time was $\$110$ trillion, although [stock market](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md). values are significantly more volatile.  

Figure O.1 shows that the five largest issuers, in terms of amounts out-. standing, are in the United States, the Eurozone, China, Japan, and the. United Kingdom, which together comprise nearly. $90\%$ of the total. The Eurozone includes countries that both belong to the European Union (EU) and use the euro as a national [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md). Some individual members of the Eurozone, indicated with asterisks in the figure, are significant issuers of. [debt securities](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Analysis%20of%20Fixed%20Income%20Securities.md) on their own. Note that the figure displays their amounts. outstanding with gray bars, but their contributions to the cumulative total are included once, with the Eurozone total..  

Figure O.2 decomposes debt outstanding in the five largest regions by sector. The large fraction of [government debt](.md) in Japan reflects decades of government [borrowing and spending](../../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Understanding%20Debt%20Crises%20and%20Their%20Management.md) intended to stimulate the economy.. The fraction of [government debt](.md) in the United States, the Eurozone, and the United Kingdom is lower, at about. $50\%$ , but has increased significantly since the [financial crisis](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) of 2007-2009. Corporations in the United States are relatively more likely to issue bonds directly to the public, while corporations in the Eurozone, Japan, and the United Kingdom are relatively more likely to borrow funds from intermediaries, like banks, which, in turn, raise money from the public. While Figure O.2 includes the breakdown for debt in China, the relatively large role of the government in financial and nonfinancial enterprises makes comparisons across sectors and regions less meaningful.

Table O.1 and Figure O.3 show the [notional amounts](../Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) of outstanding interest rate [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) across the globe. These [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) are described in later chapters, but [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) essentially allow market participants to take positions on [interest rates](../Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md), whether for [hedging](../Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md), [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), or speculative purposes. The notional amount of a derivative is used to calculate the cash flows that one of the derivative's counterparties pays the other. Adding together all [notional amounts](../Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md), however, can significantly overstate market size. First, the largest market participants, namely dealers, tend to be simultaneously long and short nearly identical [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md). Second, options are actually equivalent to only fractions of the [notional amounts](../Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) of their [underlying securities](../Chapter%207/Rate%20and%20Price%20Trees.md). Later chapters elaborate on these points, but, for the purposes of this [overview](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Overview%20of%20Financial%20Markets.md), this table and figure are reported in [notional amounts](../Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md).  

While [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) may trade in a particular locality, there is no sense in which [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) are issued in one place or another: local regulations aside, any entity, residing anywhere, can enter into these [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) contracts. A typical classification, therefore, is the [currency](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) in which the cash flows of the derivative are denominated. The first two columns of Table O.1 show [notional amounts](../Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) for swaps, options, and [forward rate agreements](../Chapter%2012/EURIBOR%20Forward%20Rate%20Agreements%20and%20Futures.md). Most of the outstanding amounts are denominated in US Dollars (USD) and Euro (EUR). The quantities in the table hint at the overstatement of market size by notional amount: if the sizes of the markets for these UsD [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) were really $\$150$ trillion, they would be larger than the combined size of all [global debt securities](.md) markets. The second two columns of the table show the [notional amounts](../Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) of standardized, exchange-traded [interest rate futures](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20III%20-%20Fixed%20Income%20Futures%20Contracts/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedging%20with%20Interest%20Rate%20Futures.md) and options. Amounts outstanding of UsD-denominated contracts are by far the greatest, with those denominated in British Pounds (GBP) and EUR making up most of the rest of the overall market.

FIGURE 0.3  Credit Default Swaps, [Notional Amounts](../Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) Outstanding, by Sector and Type, as of June 2020. Source: BIS.  

Finally, Figure O.3 gives the notional amount of credit default swaps (CDS) outstanding. These are discussed in detail in Chapter 14, but, roughly speaking, CDS allow investors to take positions that are equivalent to lever-. aged long or short positions in bonds with [credit risk](../../../Course%20Notes/Quantitative%20Trading%20Strategies%20Lecture%20Notes.md). The figure divides the market into credit sectors: CDS can be written on nonfinancial com-. panies, financial companies, sovereigns, [asset-backed](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) securities (ABS), and [mortgage-backed securities](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Fremont%20Financial%20Corp.%20(b).md) (MBs). Within each sector, a [single-name CDS](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209A-%20Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) references a single credit (e.g., the government of Spain), while an index. CDS references a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of credits (e.g., 25 European financial companies). Note that the [CDS market](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Credit%20Derivative%20Indexes.md) is much smaller in notional amount than the [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) markets depicted in Table O.1.
