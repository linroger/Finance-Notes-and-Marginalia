# 4.4 EQUITY, COMMODITY, AND EXOTIC SWAPS  

A swap can serve the role of a [flexible investment vehicle](.md). An [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) normally involves an outright purchase of a return stream earned on a risk exposure. A swap is an exchange of two streams of return flows with no outright purchase. Yet a swap structured with the receive side as the return on a risky asset and the pay side of floating LIBOR, combined with an [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in a money market account, will be equivalent to the [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in the risky asset. The floating LIBOR payments on the swap will be made with the interest earned in the money market account. The net will be the return on the risky asset. An investor can spend. $\$100$ to buy a stock or a commodity, or he can put. $\$100$ in a money market account and swap the LIBOR. interest from the account into a return on a stock or a commodity. In general, the receive side of the swap can be structured to provide the return on any asset class combination normally not easily available to the investor, and with any degree of [leverage](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%206-Leverage,%20Tail%20Risk,%20Volatility%20Products.md) desired..  

# 4.4.1 Equity Swaps  

Investors often desire equity exposure in a bond form. Some [institutional investors](../../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%204%20Institutional%20Trading.md) are prevented by regulation from holding too much equity; others seek to obtain a merger of equity exposure with principal protection. These goals can be accomplished through structured bonds which combine equity swaps and equity options.

Figure 4.2 An [equity swap](.md) as part of an equity-linked bond issue  

A common structure defines the formula for the coupon payout as the appreciation of the [stock index](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) over the accrual period times the principal of the bond times the appropriate [day-count](../Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md) fraction. The bondholder gets no interest unless the [stock index](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) appreciates during the coupon accrual period. The issuer of the bond (ABC Corp) desires low cost of financing that has nothing to do with equities. The dealer supplies the cash flows owed on the bond by entering into an [equity swap](.md) with the issuer. The dealer pays the [stock index](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) appreciation and receives a floating interest rate. The stock return is passed on to the bondholders. The structure innately includes an at-the-money equity option as the coupon paid to the bondholder cannot be negative.  

Another common equity bond structure defines the formula for the coupon payout as a small. fixed coupon, paid irrespective of the index performance, plus a portion of the appreciation of the [stock index](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) over the accrual period, times the principal of the bond times the appropriate. [day-count](../Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md) fraction. Here the bondholder gets a non-zero fixed rate supplemented either by. a predefined less-than- $100\%$ portion of the index appreciation, or as an excess appreciation. over a certain margin (negative spread), or a combination of the two. The structure innately. includes an out-of-the-money equity option as the coupon paid to the bondholder cannot be negative.  

Figure 4.2 shows a diagram for an S&P 500 index-based annual coupon with no minimum fixed coupon guarantee. The investor gets. $100\%$ appreciation of the S&P 500 in excess of. $2\%$ over each annual interest period. The bond can be constructed with. $2\%$ out-of-the-money call options on S&P 500, or with equity swaps combined with $2\%$ strike put options.' Assuming. that the (European) $2\%$ in-the-money put on the S&P 500 costs is. $1.8\%$ of the invested amount per year, the issuing company enters into an [equity swap](.md), paying quarterly LIBOR in exchange for S&P 500 return, and commits to buying a series of $2\%$ strike put options for $1.8\%$ of the principal. In Figure 4.2, SPX stands for the percentage change in the S&P 500 during the. coupon year.  

Let us trace the cash flows in three scenarios. First, if $\mathrm{SPX}>2\%$ , e.g. $\mathrm{SPX}=14\%$ , the investor is entitled to the coupon equal to the excess of SPX over $2\%$ , or $12\%$ . The issuing company, ABC, receives $14\%$ on the swap, pays $P{=}1.8\%$ for the put, but receives no payout from the put. ABC pays $12\%$ to the bondholder and keeps $0.20\%$ , which reduces its floating [financing cost](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md). Second, if $\mathrm{SPX}<2\%$ , e.g. $\mathrm{SPX}=0.5\%$ , the investor gets no coupon interest.  

ABC receives $0.5\%$ on the swap, pays $1.8\%$ for the put and receives $1.5\%$ payout from the put. ABC pays nothing to the bondholder and keeps $0.20\%$ , which reduces its [financing cost](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md). Lastly, if SPX turns out to be negative for the year, e.g. $-8\%$ , the bondholder gets no coupon. ABC pays $8\%$ on the swap, pays $1.8\%$ for the put, but receives a $10\%$ payout from the put. ABC pays nothing to the bondholder and ABC keeps $0.20\%$ as the reduction in its [financing cost](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md). Irrespective of the S&P 500 performance, ABC [financing cost](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) turns out to be LIBOR - 20 bp.  

The assumed cost $1.8\%$ of the put in Figure 4.2 is quite low. If the $2\%$ S&P puts cost more than the $1.8\%$ assumed in the figure, then the issuer can raise the coupon payout threshold or reduce the coupon participation below $100\%$ , or both.  

The [pricing](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) of equity swaps is relatively easy. An [equity swap](.md) can be viewed as an exchange of a fictitious floating rate bond for a fictitious par [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in the equities. The floating rate bond prices to par as long as it is equivalent to a rollover strategy. That is the case as long as LIBOR is set at the start and paid fully at the end of each interest accrual period. This forces the value of the bond to revert to par after each interest payment. Similarly, the fictitious equity [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) requires that all of the equity appreciation be paid out at the end of each accrual period to force the remaining value of the equity [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) to revert to the original par amount. So, while both sides of the [equity swap](.md) are floating and unknown in advance, both require the same amount of [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) dollars to replicate. The swap of the total return of S&P 500 for LIBOR is fair, i.e. it has a zero PV.  

The dual valuation argument for the [equity swap](.md) as a string of forward contracts on S&P 500 also holds directly from the [cash-and-carry](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md) relationship for [stock index futures](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%202-Futures%20Contracts.md). The [equity swap](.md) can be viewed as a string of 1-year synthetic forward (or [futures](../Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md)) contracts. In our case, abstracting from the quarterly/annual mismatch on the LIBOR side, the dealer views the swap's cash flows - pay SPX, receive LIBOR - as equivalent to a string of short index [forwards](../../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) or reverse [cash-and-carry](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md) transactions. In the reverse [cash-and-carry](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md), the dealer borrows a basket of stocks, sells the stocks short, and invests the proceeds to earn LIBOR. At the end of the year, he covers the short by buying the basket in the spot market. The initial sale and subsequent repurchase of stocks are equivalent to paying out the appreciation on the basket. The interest on [short sale](../Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Short%20Selling.md) proceeds is equivalent to receiving floating LIBOR. In order to hedge the string. of short [forwards](../../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) packaged into the swap, the dealer has to hedge by doing the opposite. That is, he has to receive the SPX appreciation and pay LIBOR. He does that by entering each year into a 1-year [cash-and-carry](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md). He borrows the principal to pay LIBOR. He buys the stocks at the beginning of each year and liquidates them on each coupon payout date. The profits on. stocks are passed to ABC to satisfy the swap obligation. The LIBOR receipt from ABC covers the borrowing cost. Each year the dealer repeats the exercise for the following year. (In reality, on the coupon pay date, the dealer liquidates only the appreciated part of the holdings, pays the proceeds to ABC, and holds the rest for the following year.).  

# 4.4.2 Commodity Swaps  

There are parallels of equity swaps that involve other asset classes. The canonical form has.   
on one side of the swap a floating interest rate stream; the other side of the swap being a periodically paid out return stream on an asset class tailored to the needs of an investor.   
A common example is a commodity swap whose coupon payout is a formula based on a.   
percentage change in the price of a commodity over the interest accrual period. Coupon. structures sold in the past have involved oil, gold, and a variety of financial assets (e.g.   
weather-related formulas, total-rate-of-return on a bond index).  

![](b509ad2b613e0aab4004cf7dba9ac3438690247596772a2b0c82bef47db99b11.jpg)  
Figure 4.3 An equity/commodity swap: cash-supported  

Similar to an [equity swap](.md), a commodity swap can be engineered in two ways. First, the commodity swap can be an exchange of a fictitious floating rate bond for a par [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in [commodities](../Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). The LIBOR coupon on the floating side is paid out every 3 or 6 months and the value of the floating rate bond reverts to par. The gain (loss) on the commodity over the coupon period is liquidated and paid out (received and reinvested), and the total [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) in. the commodity reverts to the swap par amount. Figure 4.3 shows a cash-supported oil/equity return swap. The second way of constructing the commodity side of the swap is to use the par amount to invest in a floating rate bond and enter into [futures contracts](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) (rather than spot) over the life of the swap. Using the cost-of-carry relationship, the change in the value of the [futures](../Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) each period plus the interest on the floating side is equivalent to the spot change in the. commodity value.  

The special issues of commodity swaps involve the return settlement. The [cash-and-carry](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md) equations hold for swaps, but are not guaranteed to hold for [commodities](../Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) such as oil, and can result in a contango (see Chapter 3). The cash-supported commodity swap and the futuressupported commodity swap will not produce the same [returns](../../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md). This phenomenon also affects retail commodity ETNs (see Chapters 8 and 11).  

# 4.4.3 Volatility Swaps  

Increasingly, dealers push the envelope of innovation by looking to secondary and unhedgeable variables on which to write swaps. One such variable is the historical volatility of an FX rate, the interest rate, or the volatility of a price or [stock index](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md). Another is the [inflation](../../../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate in an economy. The volatility index and [inflation](../../../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Principles%20For%20Navigating%20Big%20Debt%20Cycles/Part%20II%20Detailed%20Case%20Studies/German%20Debt%20Crisis%20andHyperinflation%20(1918–1924)/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) [futures markets](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Contango%20And%20Backwardation%20In%20Arbitrage-Free%20Futures-Markets.md) are very limited; one side of the swap cannot be easily synthetically replicated or dynamically hedged, except perhaps with the. near-month S&P 500 or Oil VIX contracts. The VIX [futures](../Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) are based on the option-implied volatilities not historicals. If the swap is on the historical volatility or on the volatility of an asset not covered by [futures](../Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), the [risk management](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) has to rely on book-matching or be part of the overall hedge for an options book. If both sides of the trade can be found, and the dealer can find two counterparties willing to take the opposite sides of swap, then the dealer can extract the bid/ask spread. If the offset cannot be found, then the only reason the dealer should enter into the [volatility swap](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Variance%20Swaps.md) is to lay off the residual [vega risk](../Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Residual%20Risk%20of%20Options%20Gamma%20Vega%20and%20Volatil.md) of his option [portfolio](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) (see Chapter 5).  

Instead of using the realized volatility that is common in [hedging](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) FX options [portfolio](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), the single stock and equity index options dealers prefer a [variance swap](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Variance%20Swaps.md) to a [volatility swap](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Variance%20Swaps.md). The [variance swap](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Variance%20Swaps.md) has a fixed and a [floating leg](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) applied to a fixed dollar [notional principal](Fundamentals%20of%20Swaps.md) $N_{V^{2}}=\mathbb{S}20$ million, and it is settled periodically. The [fixed leg](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) is defined as the "strike" variance. level, say $K=0.0144$ , equal to $12\%$ squared. The [floating leg](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) is defined as the annualized. historical (realized) volatility of the [returns](../../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on the [stock index](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md). If we settle the swap quarterly and there are 92 days in the current quarter and also assume that there are 252 (non-holiday). business days in a year, then the typical definition of the realized variance. $V^{2}$ would be:  
$$
V^{2}={\frac{252}{91}}\times\sum_{n=1}^{92}\left[\ln\left({\frac{S_{n}}{S_{n-1}}}\right)-\mu\right]
$$  

where $S_{n}$ is the value of the index on day $n$ and $\mu$ is the mean of the log-[returns](../../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md). In FX markets, the mean may be skipped, and in all markets the divisor could be 92 instead of 91. The variance is then applied to the [notional principal](Fundamentals%20of%20Swaps.md) $N_{V^{2}}$ and settled against the [fixed leg](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Pricing%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) without any [day-count](../Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Intra-Year%20Compounding%20and%20Day-Count.md) adjustment. If the realized variance is equal to $15\%$ squared or $V^{2}=0.0225$ , then the [cash flow](../Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) exchange would pay (fixed) $\$144,000$ and receive (floating) $\$225,000$  

An options dealer long vega is a natural floating payer on the [variance swap](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Variance%20Swaps.md). Vega is commonly computed in dollars per. $1\%$ standard deviation change. Suppose the dealer computes his vega to be $\$300,000$ at the current level of volatility equal to $V_{0}=12\%$ . Since the firstderivative of variance $V^{2}$ with respect to volatility. $V$ is $2V$ , the first-order point conversion. of vega to the variance swap principal is the division by $2\times V_{0}=0.24$ , scaled by 100. If we choose $N_{V^{2}}=\$125$ million as the principal, and the volatility goes up from $12\%$ to $13\%$ , the net payment on the [variance swap](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Variance%20Swaps.md) will be:  
$$
\$125,000,0000\times(0.13^{2}-0.12^{2})=\$312,500
$$  

The primary risk here is not the slight mishedge due to the second-order derivative, but the [basis risk](../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Lessons%20From%20The%20Crisis.md) between the [implied volatility](../Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/A%20Real-Life%20Option%20Pricing%20Exercise.md) driving the option [portfolio](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) vega and the realized volatility driving the [variance swap](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Variance%20Swaps.md) hedge.  

# 4.4.4 Index Principal Swaps  

An old structure, popularized in the early 1990s - which was attractive to mortgage bond investors who wanted the enhanced yield of a prepayment-exposed [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), but wanted to limit the unpredictability of prepayments - is called an [index principal swap](../../PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%208%20-%20Structured%20Finance/Structured%20Finance%20203.md) (IPS) or index amortizing rate (IAR) swap. As is often the case, this structure is driven by this specific investor demand, while the issuer simply wants reduced floating financing. The issuer issues a bond with a formula coupon and principal to the bondholders, but reverses the cash flows of the bond by entering into an IPS with a dealer.  

The swap is a fixed for floating swap, except that the [notional principal](Fundamentals%20of%20Swaps.md) of the swap changes over time. Each period one looks at the principal as of the last period times an interpolated percentage taken from an amortization table, which might look like this:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Rate</td><td>Percent notional amortized</td></tr><tr><td>3.00%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>2.00%</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>1.00%</td><td>100%</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Suppose the last period's principal was 100 and the index rate. $L_{3m}$ this period is $1.14\%$ We interpolate 1.14 between 1.00 and 2.00 in the table to obtain a notional percentage equal to $93\%$ . This period, the new [notional principal](Fundamentals%20of%20Swaps.md) used to compute interest flows on both sides. of the swap, is equal to the last principal times 100 minus the amortized percentage of 93, or 0.07. The new principal is thus 7..  

This procedure is intended to mimic the prepayment behavior of fixed rate mortgages. As. rates go down and homeowners refinance their mortgages, the principals of mortgage bonds. are reduced. Similarly, the principals of IPS bonds are reduced, but based on a prespecified. amortization table rather than on the actual behavior of homeowners who often do not refinance optimally.  

# Options on Prices and Hedge-Based Valuation  

Options are finite-term bets on the level of prices, rates and non-financial variables. The payouts on the options are contingent upon the price/rate of an "[underlying asset](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md)' being at the right level at the designated time. Option buyers have the right to receive a payout defined by a formula tied to the level of the price or rate prior to and/or at the expiry of the option if they bet right and the option is in "in-the-money," or nothing if they bet wrong and the option is "out-of-the-money." For that right they make an upfront payment called the premium. Option sellers receive the premium for the option and are obligated to make the payout on the option if the bet is in-the-money. Generally, bets on the upward movement of prices/rates are called "calls" and bets on downward movement are called "puts.  

There are two types of participants in the options markets. The speculators, also called investors, spend (receive) money to buy (sell) options and wait for the desired outcome at maturity (a price rise, a rate drop). When their bets prove right, they get a payout or keep the premium; when their bets prove wrong, they get nothing or have to make a payout. themselves. The hedgers - dealers and market-makers - do not take outright bets on the direction of [underlying securities](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Rate%20and%20Price%20Trees.md), but make their money from the flow of buying and selling.. Often, however, they encounter imbalances in the demand for buying and selling, and when that happens they put the options on their own books -- but instead of speculating, they hedge. The "[delta hedging](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments.md)" they engage in is akin to manufacturing (synthetically replicating) the. payouts of the options they bought (or sold). Their risk is not that their bets prove wrong, but only that they over- or underestimate the cost of the manufacture of the payoffs on the bets they bought at the bid or sold at the ask, the [bid-ask spread](../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Bid%20Ask%20and%20Transaction%20Prices%20in%20a%20Specialist%20Market%20With%20Heterogeneously%20Informed%20Traders.md) being a small margin of safety relative to the cost. If they estimate the cost correctly, they always earn a profit whether prices go up or down. [Dynamic delta hedging](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20V%20-%20Options%20Pricing/Chapter%2022%20-%20BOPM:%20Implementation.md) is the main principle of option valuation..  

This chapter covers the basic payoff definitions of options, the main static no-[arbitrage](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md). condition called the [put-call parity](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/7.%20Black%20Scholes%20Model.md), and the delta-[hedging](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) technique as the tool behind not only sound option trading but also all option valuation. The value of the option is the unique amount of money one needs to synthetically replicate the payoff of the option in all price scenarios, irrespective of whether the option will pay or not. The [binomial model](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%204-Multiperiod%20Binomial%20Trees/Binomial%20Option%20Pricing.md), or the. [Black-Scholes formula](../../../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%205.md) and its extensions, are the mathematical representation of the delta hedge concept.  

The chapter has two central ideas. The first is that there is a big difference between options. markets and insurance markets. While the options markets borrow the language and structure. of insurance - premium, even-driven payout, payout dependent on the severity of the event -- options dealers have one tool in their [risk management](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) tool-kit that insurance companies (and sports bookmakers) do not. They buy and sell bets whose payoffs depend on the prices or rates of instruments that themselves can be bought and sold continuously. Insurance companies and bookmakers sell their bets on the outcomes of future events (earthquake, flood, fire, soccer game). As they cannot "buy" these events, to manage the risk they adjust the odds or premiums to reflect the [demand and supply](../../../../International%20Finance/China%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Reserves/Currency%20Appreciation%20and%20Depreciation.md) of bets. In contrast, a dealer who has sold a call option on a stock can buy the stock; if the stock goes up, he can use the profit from the stock's rise to cover his liability on the option. His job is harder than that of a [cash-and-carry](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Carry%20Trade.md) hedger of a forward/[futures](../Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) contract who buys the asset and fixes financing once. The option dealer's hedge is dynamic. Every day, as the stock rises, he buys more of it; when it falls he sells some of it, expecting a lower liability. This manufacturing of the payoff liability, known as [delta hedging](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Instruments.md), works for almost all options: calls and puts, bought and sold, linear and binary payouts, options on stocks, currencies, and [interest rates](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md). The main factor in the cost of this manufacture is the volatility of the [underlying asset](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md)'s price/rate. The more it moves up and down, the more it costs the dealer to adjust the hedge prior to the expiry time. The [bottom line](../../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Financial%20Ratios/Operating%20Income%20vs.%20Net%20Income%20What's%20the%20Difference.md). is: the dealer does not have to speculate on the direction of the price/rate, but can earn profit. for the service of manufacturing the bet's payoff.  

The second idea of the chapter is the contrast between speculators and delta hedgers. In. order to eliminate risk, the dealer resells his option position to someone else or, for as long as. necessary, delta hedges, actively trading the [underlying asset](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md) and accumulating gains/losses. By the resale time or expiry date, these gains/losses are exactly equal to what he needs to liquidate the position. The speculator does not eliminate but seeks risk. Like the homeowner buying insurance in order to "profit' from a house fire, the speculator buys a directional bet and waits for the outcome to materialize. If he is right, he gets a payout formula that depends. on the outcome, e.g. the excess of the [stock price](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Black–Scholes%20Model.md) over some level in a call option..  

These two central ideas conspire to the fact that option [pricing](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) is driven not by participants' subjective probabilities of the outcomes ([expectations](../../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) of the stocks going up or down), but by the dealers' estimated costs of payoff manufacture. That cost fluctuates with the perceived volatility of the [underlying asset](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md), called the [implied volatility](../Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/A%20Real-Life%20Option%20Pricing%20Exercise.md); sometimes bets seem cheap, sometimes dear, relative to the future payoff.  

Options are redundant securities. Their payoffs can be manufactured through dynamic replicating strategies. The profit the dealer earns can be thought of as the fee for the convenience of preparing the payoff, so that the speculator does not have to manufacture it himself. This is like the markup for the off-the-rack clothes that you do not have to tailor yourself. Redundant does not mean useless. Options allow complicated risk-sharing schemes for investors. Since the primary function of [securities markets](../../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%201%20Introduction%20to%20Securities%20Trading%20and%20Markets.md) is to channel savings into [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), the saversinvestors (banks and funds on their behalf) must be offered liquid means of earning return for taking on various risks. Stock and [credit markets](../../../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%201.md) offer broad access to equity and default. risks, and options further that access. Through them, stock and bond investors are able to sell part of their risk by entering limited-time bets to forgo the upside or to protect the value of their investments. An analogy is the decision to buy a house for. $\$1$ million dollars. Without. the ability to buy fire and flood insurance, or to borrow money against the house in case of need, surely fewer investors would buy..
