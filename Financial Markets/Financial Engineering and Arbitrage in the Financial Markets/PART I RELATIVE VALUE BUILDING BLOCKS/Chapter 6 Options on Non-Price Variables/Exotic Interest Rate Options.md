# 6.4 EXOTIC INTEREST RATE OPTIONS  

The term "[exotic](.md) options" applies to all options traded over-the-counter whose payoffs do not follow the standard over or under the strike call/put blueprint. [Exotic](.md) options include digital (binary) options (fixed payoffs irrespective of how far in the money the option is), barrier options, e.g. knock-ins or knock-outs (the underlying price/rate has to hit/not hit a barrier prior to expiry for the payoff formula to apply), as well as a whole variety of options that are difficult to price because their primary risk is not easily hedged. We do not attempt a complete list of the exotics; instead, we focus on two very popular structures that appear to be deceivingly simple. In reality, they are anything but simple.  

# 6.4.1Periodic Caps  

Consider a fairly standard provision of an adjustable rate mortgage. The [interest rate changes](../../../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke/How%20Countries%20Go%20Broke-Chapter%2012%20to%20Chapter%2014.md) once a year on the basis of some floating index. The mortgagee has in effect issued a floating rate bond to finance a house purchase. Every year, the interest rate he pays is based on the cost of funds for that year (set at the beginning of the year based on some 1-year money rate). Next year the rate adjusts up or down, but the rate is guaranteed not to go up by more than. $2\%$ year-to-year or $6\%$ total over the lifetime. So if the index changes from $3\%$ to $6\%$ , the homeowner's rate increases only by. $2\%$ instead of $3\%$ . The option the homeowner holds is. not a standard call option on a rate or a cap. The strike on the option changes every year and is based on last year's rate and last year's strike. If the index changes from. $6\%$ to $9\%$ the following year, the mortgage rate again only goes up only by $2\%$ , and only from the already "unfairly" low previous year's level that did not reflect a full index increase at that time. Mortgage banks that want to protect themselves against income lost due to these imbedded options purchase periodic caps from dealers. Periodic caps pay the difference between the mortgage rate (with the options) and the fully indexed floating rate (without the options). The resetting strike feature changes the probability of payoff relative to a straight call. It also changes how the payoff can be manufactured. The dealer-hedger cannot compute the delta on the option until he knows the strike. Thus, it is not the [implied volatility](../Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/A%20Real-Life%20Option%20Pricing%20Exercise.md) over the entire life of the option that determines the cost of manufacturing, but the sequence of future implied volatilities on shorter one-year options. This is true with a caveat that previous strikes also carry over, as in our example. The cost of [payoff manufacturing](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%204-Multiperiod%20Binomial%20Trees/Binomial%20Option%20Pricing.md) has thus a known component (stickiness of the strike) and some unknown component (future annual rate differences). The premium quoted will reflect the subjective bet on the future path of implied volatilities (or the volatility of volatility).  

# 6.4.2 Digitals and Ranges  

A digital option is an option with a fixed monetary payoff if a price or rate breaches a certain strike level. A range is a compound version of a digital option where the underlying price or rate has to breach one level but not go over or under another level, i.e. it has to end up  

within a predetermined range. These structures are popular in commodity, FX, and interest rate markets. In interest rate markets, they are typically packaged into cap- of floor-like serial forms.   
with short-term LIBOR rates as the underlyings and range levels changing period-to-period..   
These options are not difficult to price theoretically, but they pose a risk of low-probability.   
events with highly uncertain hedge outcomes..  

Suppose we sold an FX range that pays $\$1$ if the USD/EUR rate is within 1.30 and 1.50. We price the option using a binomial tree and have followed the hedge recipe. At 1 day prior to expiry, the spot USD/EUR FX rate stands at 1.50. If it ticks up by tomorrow, we will owe nothing to the option holder. If it ticks down we will owe $\$1$ (everything). There is no effective hedge strategy that will produce the desired payoff, $\$0$ or $\$1$ . We have to gamble. At the time the option was sold, this knife-edge event had effectively a zero probability. In a standard call or put, these events do not occur because the size of the payoff changes monotonically with the level of the rate, allowing us to adjust the hedge. Here it jumps from zero to everything over an almost non-existent move in the underlying.  

# Default Risk and Credit Derivatives  

As of 2011, while [currency trading](../../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) still dominates the daily turnover and interest rate swaps. dominate the total principal outstanding, [credit derivatives](../../../../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) form one of the fastest growing seg-. ments of the global financial over-the-counter markets. Rightly or wrongly, they also received. bad press and blame for the 2008 [financial crisis](../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) and the 2010 European [debt crisis](../../../../International%20Finance/Bridgewater/Chapters/US%20Debt%20Crisis%20and%20Adjustment%20(2007â€“2011).md). [Credit derivatives](../../../../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) are insurance-like contracts between two counterparties where protection buyers make [periodic premium payments](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) to protection sellers who promise to make potentially large one-time payouts contingent on adverse corporate events, particularly defaults in corporate bonds. The demand for such insurance should not be surprising. In all [asset markets](../Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Primary%20Issuance%20and%20Secondary%20Resale%20Markets.md), investors. make [risk management](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) decisions. Equity investors and insurance companies tend to diversify their risks. Concentrated investors tend to hedge: insurers reinsure, real estate owners buy hazard insurance, large equity holders buy puts or collars. Corporate bond investors and lenders seek [credit derivatives](../../../../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) as a way to eliminate (hedge) their exposure to defaults on individual corporate bonds or entire portfolios of corporate bonds and loans. The role of [credit derivatives](../../../../Credit%20Markets/RISK%20NEUTRAL%20VALUATION%20FRAMEWORK%20FOR%20CREDIT%20DEFAULT%20SWAPS.md) in the 2008 [financial crisis](../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Letter.md) perhaps lies not in their function as enablers of speculation on adverse events, but mainly in the massive defaults of two large protection sellers, Lehman and AIG, and the systemic consequences of that..  

Standard Bond Math techniques based on [cash flow](../Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) discounting do not tackle explicitly. the possibility of default. In Bond Math, coupon and principal cash flows are assumed to be known with certainty. Prices of securities are computed as the present values of the known. cash flows discounted by given discount rates. These discount rates implicitly account for the uncertainty about the cash flows. In Bond Math, the discount rates used are either the yieldsto-maturity or the zero-coupon rates bootstrapped from the yields-to-maturity. If the issuer of the priced bond is not a sovereign entity that prints money, but a corporate (or municipal). entity that could default on its obligations, then the yields-to-maturity or zero-coupon rates. used to discount cash flows are adjusted up by what is loosely termed corporate spread, and. the resulting present value or the price of the bond is lower than that on an otherwise similar. sovereign bond. Conversely, given the price of a corporate bond, investors often compute the. yield-to-maturity as the internal rate of return on the bond's cash flows, i.e. the [discount rate](../../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/PSET%207-%20Kohler.md) which, when used to discount the bond's cash flows, produces the present value equal to the bond's price. The computed yield-to-maturity can then be compared to the yield on a similar sovereign bond (same term and coupon level) to make return vs risk [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) decisions.  

In this chapter, standard Bond Math (yield curve construction) is paired with probabilistic. models of corporate default. There are two main approaches to modeling defaults: [structural models](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Credit%20Risk%20Models%20and%20the%20Valuation%20of%20Credit%20%20Default%20Swap%20Contracts.md) of the firm asset value and its debt/equity financing, and [reduced-form models](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Credit%20Risk%20Models%20and%20the%20Valuation%20of%20Credit%20%20Default%20Swap%20Contracts.md) of corporate yield curve bootstrapping (e.g. Poisson model). [Structural models](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Credit%20Risk%20Models%20and%20the%20Valuation%20of%20Credit%20%20Default%20Swap%20Contracts.md) are the basis for what is known as corporate [arbitrage](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) (the cheapness/richness of the company's debt relative to its equity, including the hybrids), convertibles, and preferred. The [reduced-form models](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Credit%20Risk%20Models%20and%20the%20Valuation%20of%20Credit%20%20Default%20Swap%20Contracts.md) are the basis of most [credit derivative pricing](../Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/A%20Poisson%20Model%20of%20Single%20Issuer%20Default.md), the way [Black-Scholes](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Mathematical%20Modeling%20of%20Derivative%20Pricing.md) is for stock options. They rely on survival (non-default) probability calibrations to sets of increasing-maturity corporate bonds for a single issuer (similar to the yield curve bootstrap), and may include assumptions.  

about the correlation of the reference issuer's default and the [protection seller](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md)'s default. We limit our discussion to [reduced-form models](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Credit%20Risk%20Models%20and%20the%20Valuation%20of%20Credit%20%20Default%20Swap%20Contracts.md)..  

We start with the definition of the most common credit derivative structure, the credit-default swap (CDS), and its basic no-[arbitrage](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) relationship to the corporate spread. We proceed with. a simple [binomial](../Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/A%20Real-Life%20Option%20Pricing%20Exercise.md) default [probability model](../../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%202%20-%20Uncertainty,%20Information,%20and%20Stochastic%20Processes/Probability%20Space.md) in order to put structure on the relationship of [default probabilities](../../../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%203.md) to corporate spreads. We assume no value recovery following the default, but show extensions of the basic model to a richer credit migration framework. We then come back to the [binomial](../Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/A%20Real-Life%20Option%20Pricing%20Exercise.md) enhanced with the standard [Poisson process](../Chapter%207%20-%20Default%20Risk%20and%20Credit%20Derivatives/A%20Poisson%20Model%20of%20Single%20Issuer%20Default.md) of single issuer default under. the assumption of a known [recovery rate](../../../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%203.md) and no correlation between the bond issuer and the. default swap writer. We end the chapter with a simplified Bernoulli framework for including. the correlation of the issuer and swap seller defaults..  

We defer the broader discussion of correlations, [basket credit derivatives](../../PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Cred.md) and [collateralized debt obligations](../../../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Markets%20Session%205.md) (CDOs) to Chapter 10. [Basket credit derivatives](../../PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Cred.md) are multiple-[default insurance](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Credit%20Default%20Swaps.md) arrangements on more than one issuer name. They are written in the form of first-to-default,. last-to-default, or multiple-default payouts. The [pricing](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) of basket credit defaults relies on the modeling of the multivariate [probability distributions](../../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) in a way that is consistent with the single issuer modeling of the marginal distributions, while allowing for a [default correlation](../../PART%20II%20CASH%20FLOW%20ENGINEERING/Chapter%2010%20-%20Collateralized%20Debt%20Obligations%20and%20Basket%20Credit%20Derivatives/Copulas%20and%20the%20Modeling%20of%20Default%20Correlatio.md) structure among many issuers. The standard approach involves using a copula function which, in mathematical probability theory, is defined as a multivariate function of correlated uniform random variables whose transforms have known marginal probability density functions.
