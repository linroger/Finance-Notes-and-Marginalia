# 3.1 FUNDAMENTALS OF FUTURES AND FORWARDS  

A [[Fundamentals of Futures and Forwards|spot transaction]] is a contract to buy or sell an asset for immediate delivery. Cash is paid and the asset is received now. A forward is a contract to buy or sell a specified quantity of an asset at a price agreed upon today, but for delivery at some future date called the expiry date. The seller is said to short (go short), the buyer of the asset is said to long (go long) the forward. In a. physical-settled forward, the seller delivers the physical asset and, on the delivery date, receives the pre-agreed price for it. In a cash-settled forward, the seller does not deliver the asset on the delivery date. The buyer pays to the seller (or receives from the seller) the difference between the pre-agreed price and the spot price on the day of the delivery. Economically, the physicaland cash-settled [[Forwards and Futures|forwards]] are the same. If, in the physical forward, the original [[Forward Contracts and Forward Prices|forward price]] was lower (higher) than the delivery spot price, the buyer takes possession of the commodity for that lower (higher) price. In the cash forward, the buyer receives (pays) the difference. between the final spot price and the original [[Forward Contracts and Forward Prices|forward price]], but has to pay the final spot price for the commodity. If the final spot price is higher than the [[Forward Contracts and Forward Prices|forward price]], he is compensated.  

for the difference; if the final spot price is lower, he pays the difference. No matter what, his total outlay for the commodity is equal to the original [[Forward Contracts and Forward Prices|forward price]]..  

Importantly, both in physical and cash [[Forwards and Futures|forwards]], no asset or cash changes hands at the time the [[Forward Points in Currency|forward contract]] is established (zero entry cost), and the settlement takes place once at the end. A [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] contract is analogous to a forward, but the settlement is piecemeal (daily) and through a clearinghouse. The buyer (going long) and the seller ([[Short Selling|going short]]) agree on a price and the number of contracts (quantity). Instead of waiting until expiry, each day they pay or receive cash flows equal to the movement in the price of the commodity, depending on whether. the price goes up or down. These cash flows are referred to as marking-to-market payments. or the [[Repurchase Agreements|variation margin]] settlement. On the expiry date, the [[Futures Price and the Quality Option Before E|futures price]] of the commodity is set equal to the spot price, so that the net cumulative [[Repurchase Agreements|variation margin]] exchanged is equal to. the difference between that [[Hedging Strategies with Forwards|future spot price]] and the original agreed-upon [[Futures Price and the Quality Option Before E|futures price]] (times the quantity), just as in a [[Forward Points in Currency|forward contract]].  

The purpose of marking-to-market through a clearinghouse is twofold: credit mitigation. and fungibility. [[Contango And Backwardation In Arbitrage-Free Futures-Markets|Futures markets]] bring together buyers and sellers from all parts of the world, unfamiliar with each other or unwilling to trust each other on contract performance. Therefore, each [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] trade, while entered into between two willing parties on the exchange, has the exchange's clearinghouse in the middle. The clearinghouse requires both parties to maintain a cash margin and it collects/distributes the daily [[Repurchase Agreements|variation margin]] settlement cash from/into the margin account. The clearinghouse can guarantee contract performance not because it has a large amount of its own capital, but because all bets are settled to their current liquidation value at the end of each day, and the clearinghouse can liquidate contracts if the next day's price movements begin to exceed the maintenance margin. Credit exposure is thus limited to one day at most, not to the entire contract period..  

Having all party-to-party transactions rewritten to involve the central clearinghouse also. allows for easy [[Short Selling|shorting]] and unwinding. Since each contract is legally with the clearinghouse. (and settled at the end of each day), buys and sells between different counterparties are fungible. (substitutable) and can be netted. Buys and sells can come in any order. Contracts bought by A from B can be unwound by contracts sold by A to C. Contracts sold by A to B can be unwound. by contracts bought by A from C. If A bought six contracts from B at 95 on Monday and sells four contracts to C at 92 on Wednesday, the four sold contracts get settled by A paying the net. [[Repurchase Agreements|variation margin]] of 3 each to the clearinghouse. Subsequently, A is long two, B is short six, and C is long four contracts. The clearinghouse is the other side of each position and has zero net overall exposure.  

While only larger well-capitalized firms can handle the counterparty risk and unwinding difficulties of the [[Forwards and Futures|forwards]], the mark-to-market mechanism of the [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] encourages smaller speculators into the market. This improves price discovery and [[Purpose and Structure of Financial Markets 1|risk sharing]] over time. Often the final buyers and suppliers of the [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|commodities]] do not operate on the same production calendars. Agricultural crops may be reaped once or twice a year, while consumption is spread evenly. This timing-gap risk is bridged by the speculators.  

In general, [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|commodities]] can be divided into two main groups: financial and non-financial.. The first group includes equity indexes, [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]], and currencies. The second group. includes agriculturals, metals, and energy. Some subgroups contain peculiar [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|commodities]]: bond [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] allowing a choice of what to deliver; [[Fed Fund Futures|Fed Funds futures]] settled off average. effective rates over a month; electricity swap contracts on price differentials between delivery points or times; and weather contracts on cumulative temperature differentials over a month. One useful categorization of [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|commodities]] is as a spectrum that runs from those subject to the strict [[Dollar Rolls|cash-and-carry arbitrage]] (most financials), to one-sided [[Carry Trade|cash-and-carry]] (easily storable agriculturals and metals), to strategic [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|commodities]] (oil) with an almost broken [[Carry Trade|cash-and-carry]] link, and to [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|commodities]] with no or multiple spot markets (weather, electricity). The principle. of [[Dollar Rolls|cash-and-carry arbitrage]] is essential to understanding why [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] prices do not arbitrarily deviate from [[Contango And Backwardation In Arbitrage-Free Futures-Markets|spot prices]].  

Some of the newest frontiers of forward and [[Contango And Backwardation In Arbitrage-Free Futures-Markets|futures markets]], often referred to as predictions. markets, are contracts on non-price events. Weather, sports, political, and macroeconomic events belong in this category. The [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] and trading of these contracts relates closely to bookmaking (varying prices to ensure that the total take is at least as great as the future payout).. It may rely on scientific [[Week 2 Fundamentals Of Forecasting|forecasting]] and actuarial science, i.e. insurance. These contracts cannot be hedged with positions in the spot commodity or any related [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|commodities]] providing at least a partial hedge. These markets are truly in a category of their own. They should not be confused. with contracts on events (defaults, downgrades, corporate announcements) that can be hedged with positions in related assets (corporate bonds, stocks). This last category is closely related to options with their associated hedge-based [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] methodology..
