# 1.6 PRIMARY (ISSUANCE) AND SECONDARY (RESALE) MARKETS  

From the societal welfare perspective, the primary role of [financial markets](../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) has always been to [transfer funds](.md) between suppliers of excess funds and their users. The users include businesses that produce goods and services in the economy, households that demand mortgage and consumer loans, governments that build roads and schools, [financial institutions](../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md), and many others. All these [users of capital](.md) undertake activities that are deemed economically and socially desirable. Throughout history, bankers and banks made the transfer of funds possible by accepting funds from depositors and lending them to kings and commercial ventures. The transition from feudalism to capitalism ushered in [asset markets](.md) and the transfer of capital through shares of limited liability companies and bonds issued by sovereigns and corporations. Stock, bond, and commodity exchanges were formed to allow original investors in these. securities to efficiently share the risks of these instruments with new investors. This induced many suppliers of funds to willingly become investors as the risks of holding "paper' assets were diminished. "Paper' could be sold and funds recovered. A specialized class of traders emerged who dealt only with trading "paper' on the exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC).. At the same time, the role of finding productive ventures in need of capital also shifted from. bankers to [investment bankers](.md) who, instead of using their own capital to grant loans, specialized. in creating new shares and bonds and selling them to investors. This requires a considerable amount of expertise. Prior to the launch of any issue, the main job of an [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) banker and his [corporate finance](../../../../Course%20Notes/Corporate%20Finance%20Lecture%20Notes.md) staff, like that of a loan banker, is to evaluate the issuing company's. business and financial condition, and prepare a valuation analysis for the offered security.  

[Financial markets](../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) for securities are organized into two segments, defined by the parties to a [securities transaction](.md):  

.Primary markets .Secondary markets.  

This segregation exists only in securities, not in private-party contracts like OTC [derivatives](../../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md).. In private contracts, the [primary market](.md) issuers also tend to be the [secondary market](.md) traders,. and the [secondary market](.md) operates through assignments and mark-to-market settlements rather than through resale.  

In primary markets, the suppliers of funds transfer their excess funds directly to the users of funds through a purchase of securities. An [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) banker acts as an intermediary, but the paper-for-cash exchange is between the issuing company and the investor. The shares are sold either publicly, through an [initial public offering](.md) (IPO) or a seasoned offering, or privately through a [private placement](.md) with "qualified investors,' typically large institutions. Securities laws of the country in which the shares are sold spell out all the steps the [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) bank must take to bring the issue to market. For example, in the USA the shares must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and a prospectus must be presented to new investors prior to a sale, etc. Private placements follow different rules, the presumption being. that large qualified investors need less protection than retail investors. In the USA they are. governed by Rule 144-A, which allows their subsequent secondary trading through a system. similar to an exchange.  

In secondary markets, securities are traded between investors without the involvement of the issuer. Secondary markets can be organized as exchanges or as OTC networks of dealers connected by phone or computer, or a hybrid of the two. The Deutsche Borse and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) are examples of organized exchanges. It is worth noting, however, that exchanges differ greatly from each other. The NYSE gives access to trade flow information to human market-makers called specialists to ensure the continuity of the market-making in a given stock, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange is an electronic market where continuity is not guaranteed but no dealer can earn monopoly rents from private information about buying. and selling. Corporate and government bond trading are the best examples of [OTC markets](../../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/A%20Survey%20of%20the%20Micro%20structure%20of%20Fixed-Income%20Markets.md). There, as in swap and [currency](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md) markets, all participants are dealers who trade one-on-one for their own account. They maintain contact with each other over a phone and computer network, and jointly police the fair conduct rules through industry associations. For example, in the OTC [derivatives](../../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) markets, the International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) standardizes the terminology used in quoting the terms and rates, and formalizes the documentation used in confirming trades for a variety of swap and credit derivative agreements. The best example of a hybrid between an exchange and an OTC market is the NASDAQ in the USA. The exchange is only virtual, as participants are connected through a computer system. Access is limited to members only and all members are dealers..  

The landscape of exchange trading has seen many changes over the last 10 years. Many exchanges have merged, and human-intensive trading [floors](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Caps%20and%20Floors.md) have given way to electronic platforms. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) swallowed its cross-town rivals. The Deutsche Borse made a bid for NYSE Euronext in 2011. The electronic International Securities Exchange (ISE) has wrestled half the market share of all US stock option trading from the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE). Stock trading has fragmented significantly with volume diverted from the exchanges to electronic communications networks (ECNs) and anonymity-providing "dark pools,' and many brokerages internalizing retail flow. The global stock markets continue to be quite fragmented with clearing done mostly locally.  

Developing countries strive to create smooth functioning secondary markets. They rush. to open [stock exchanges](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/An%20Introduction%20to%20Equity%20Markets.md) even though there may only be a few companies issuing shares. In order to improve the [liquidity](../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) of trading, nascent exchanges sometimes deliberately limit access and time of trading. All these efforts are aimed at funneling all buyers and sellers into one venue. This parallels the goals of the specialist system on the NYSE. The governments. in developing countries also strive to establish well-functioning government bond markets,. issuing short-term obligations first and introducing longer maturities as soon as the market shows an appetite for them.  

The main objective in establishing these secondary trading places is to lower the cost of [raising capital](../../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%206/Week%206%20Assignment%20Review.md) by offering the [primary market](.md) investors a large outlet for subsequent [risk sharing](Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets%201.md). Unless investors are convinced that they can easily enter - and exit - these. securities, they do not buy the equities and bonds offered by the issuers (local businesses and governments). This "tail wagging the dog" pattern of creating secondary markets first is typical not only for lesser-developed nations, but is quite common in introducing any brand new risk class into the marketplace. In the late 1980s, Michael Milken's success in selling highly speculative high-yield bonds to investors relied primarily in creating a secondary OTC market by assuring active market-making by his firm Drexel Burnham Lambert. Prior to its collapse in 2002, Enron's success in originating energy [forwards](../../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Forwards%20and%20Futures.md) and contingent contracts was driven by the company's ability to establish itself as a virtual exchange of energy [derivatives](../../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md). (with Enron acting as the monopolist dealer, of course). In both of these cases, the firms behind the creation of these markets failed, but the [primary and secondary markets](.md) they started. remained strong. Newer examples of this "[secondary market](.md) first' phenomenon include the expansion of trading of [private placement](.md) shares in the USA, the emergence of the market in [private equity](../../PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2014%20-%20Private%20Equity,%20Pension,%20and%20Sovereign%20Funds/Private%20Equity.md) secondaries, the creation of OTC and trading in synthetic collateralized debt. obligations (CDOs, Chapter 10), or Goldman's floating of Facebook's and other venture-funded companies' shares prior to their registration in 2011..
