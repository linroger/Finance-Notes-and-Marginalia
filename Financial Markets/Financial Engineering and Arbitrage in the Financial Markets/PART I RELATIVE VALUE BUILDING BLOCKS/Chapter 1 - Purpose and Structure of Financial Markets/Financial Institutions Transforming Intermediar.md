# 1.5 FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: TRANSFORMING INTERMEDIARIES VS BROKER-DEALERS  

From a macroeconomic perspective, financial institutions can be broadly divided into two categories based on their raison d' etre:  

asset transformers broker-dealers.  

The easiest way to identify them is by examining their balance sheets. The assets of asset transformers are different from their liabilities. Broker-dealers may have different mixes, but the categories tend to be the same.  

An asset transformer is an institution that invests in certain assets, but issues liabilities in a form that is designed to appeal to a particular group of customers. The best example is a commercial bank. On the asset side, a bank issues consumer (mortgage, auto) and business loans, invests in bonds, etc. The main form of liability it issues is checking accounts, saving. accounts, and CDs. Customers specifically desire these vehicles as they facilitate their day-today transactions and often offer security of government insurance. For example, in the USA the FDIC guarantees all deposits up to. $\$250,000$ per customer per bank. The bank's retail. customers do not invest directly in the bank's assets. This would be quite inconvenient as they. would have to buy "bulky' assets with undesirably long maturity that entails price risk if they are sold quickly, and only offered in large denominations. In order to attract funding, the bank repackages its mortgage and business loan assets into liabilities, such as checking accounts and CDs, that have palatable characteristics -- instant bankomat access, small denomination, short maturity, and deposit insurance. Another example of a "mild"' asset transformer is a mutual fund (or a unit investment trust). A mutual fund invests in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or money market instruments, but issues small denomination, easily redeemable, participation shares and offers a variety of services such as daily net asset value calculation, telephone/internet fund redemption and exchange, or a check-writing ability. Other "strong' asset transformers are insurance companies. They invest in real estate, stocks, and bonds, but issue policies with payouts tied to life or hardships events (liabilities)..  

Because they participate in the very important cycle of capital flow between individuals and business - including money/credit creation (see later, Figure 13.1) - asset transformers are subject to special regulations and government supervision. Banks require bank charters to operate, are subject to central bank oversight, and must belong to deposit insurance schemes; the regulation of mutual funds is aimed at protecting small investors (e.g. as provided for by. the Investment Company Act in the USA); and insurance company rates are often sanctioned by state insurance boards. The laws in all these cases set specific forms of legal liabilities that asset transformers may create and sound investment guidelines they must follow (e.g. percentage of assets in a particular category). Asset transformers are compensated largely for their role in repackaging their assets with undesirable features into liabilities with customer-. friendly features -- and that very activity automatically introduces risks into their operations. Bank liabilities have a much shorter duration (checking accounts) than their assets (fixed-rate mortgages). If interest rates do not move in parallel, the spread they earn (interest differential between rates charged on loans and rates paid on deposits) fluctuates and can be negative. They pursue relative value arbitrage in order to reduce this duration gap. Insurance companies deal with largely unhedgeable risks, and utilize reinsurance and securitization to share the risk.  

Broker-dealers are different. They do not change the form of the securities they own and owe. They buy stocks, currencies, mortgage bonds, leases, etc., and sell the same securities. As dealers, they own them temporarily before they sell them, exposing themselves to market risks; as brokers, they match buyers and sellers..  

Broker-dealers play an important role in the capital transfer from individuals to business through primary sale and secondary resale transactions, transferring securities from the original issuers to buyers as well as from existing owners to new owners. The first function is known as investment banking or corporate finance, the latter as dealing or trading. The purest forms of broker-dealers exist in the USA and Japan where the laws have historically separated them from other forms of banking. Securities firms in those two countries are pure brokerdealers (investment banking, institutional trading, and retail brokerage) with the addition of asset-transforming businesses of asset management and lending. In continental Europe,. financial institutions are conglomerates, and are commonly referred to as universal banks as they combine both functions. In recent years, with the repeal of the Glass-Steagal Act in the USA and the wave of consolidations on both sides of the Atlantic, the US firms have converged more closely to the European model (Bank of America Merrill Lynch). Brokerdealers tend to be less regulated than asset transformers with the focus of the laws primarily on small investor protection (securities disclosure, fiduciary responsibilities of advisers, etc.). Post-2008 regulations have, however, brought them closer to banking regulations, but not fully.  

Asset transformers and broker-dealers compete for each other's business. Securities firms engage in secured and unsecured lending and offer check-writing in their brokerage accounts.. They also compete with mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by creating bundled or indexed securities designed to offer the same benefits of diversification. Commercial banks securitize credit card and mortgage loans to trade them out of their balance sheets. The trend. globally has been toward disintermediation, i.e. securitization of previously transformed assets into standardized tradeable packages with retail customers increasingly gaining access to these new markets.
