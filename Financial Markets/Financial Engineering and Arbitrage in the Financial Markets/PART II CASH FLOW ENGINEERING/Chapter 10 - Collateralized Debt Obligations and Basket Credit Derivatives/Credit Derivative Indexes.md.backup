# 10.5  CREDIT DERIVATIVE INDEXES  

In 2011 there were two main [credit derivative indexes](.md). In Europe, the [iTraxx](.md) CDS Europe. index tracks 125 [investment grade corporate credits](.md), changed every 6 months. The index is. owned by the International Index Company, a subsidiary of the Markit Group. The IIC licenses the index to over 30 market makers for over-the-counter trading. Markit.com provides daily. [pricing](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) information on the index. It also offers several sub-group indexes, but the trading in these indexes is very thin.  

In North America, the dominant index is the CDX or the CDX.NA, also referencing 125 [investment grade corporate credits](.md). The index is owned by the CDS Index Company, a sub-. sidiary of the Markit Group. There is also a CDX.EM index covering fewer than 15 emerging. market credits.  

The indexes provide a good way of tracking the overall level of prices in the [CDS market](.md).. However, they suffer from the same drawbacks as any insurance cost index. Insurance is purchased on an individualized basis to insure the loss on a specific [portfolio](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of risks. An index often covers risks that may not be of interest to the buyer of the insurance. That is why,. while the volume of CDS trading continues to grow rapidly, the CDS index trading lags.  

This issue is important to understand. After 2010, as part of the gigantic [Dodd-Frank](../../../../Course%20Notes/HBR%20Notes/Note%20on%20The%20Dodd-Frank%20Act%20and%20Its%20Impact.md). Reform Act, there was an effort in the USA to move the settlement of the CDS trading from. over-the-counter to a clearing house. Presumably, the rationale is that the volume of CDS trading is a multiple of the total outstanding of the insured credits, therefore there is undue counterparty risk. It remains to be seen to what degree this effort will succeed. First of all, netting alleviates the counterparty risk; but since CDS trading is customized party-to-party insurance-like in character, it is not obvious how it can be efficiently cleared by a centralized agent on a fully standardized and collateralized basis. To define an index and trade it, is one thing. To trade thousands of different customized contracts off the exchange, but to clear them through an exchange, is another. The documentation issue alone could put the clearing agent at legal risk. The law drafters should probably have put a little more thought into this before enacting it.  

# Individual Investors: A Survey of Modern Investment Theory  

In this first chapter on the players in the [financial markets](../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md), we consider the tiniest economic agent: you and me. Individuals supply funds to business by investing in securities directly,. with the help of pooling funds, or through complex intermediated arrangements. Figure 11.1 shows a simplified graph of those flows and is a subpart of the full flow of funds diagram in Chapter 13 (Figure 13.1), where we tackle the capital transformation role of banks in the economy and their long asset-short liability dilemma..  

How individuals should select their investments has been a subject of serious financial economics research for the last 80 years. The subject is complicated as it blends the characteristics of investments with the goals of individuals. The latter are often referred to as the [optimal consumption](../../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%206%20-%20Individual%20optimality/Dynamic%20Programming.md)-[investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) bundle. The main characteristics of individuals taken into account include age/longevity ([investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) horizon) and bequest (estate planning), consumption/[cash flow](../../PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) constraints (including housing needs), and the investor's natural attitude toward risk. The latter is most often represented by \*risk aversion,' but may include other behavioral and psychological factors.  

In general, the approach to [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) can be divided into two kinds: active and passive. An active investor seeks to analyze each [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) on its own merits, and to value it in some way in order to uncover the value (positive or negative) that is not reflected in the [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md)'s current price. The active investor relies on his superior knowledge of the [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), his superior analysis method, or the speed of analysis and execution. The active investor takes a relatively short perspective. He takes a position (buys, sells, shorts, or enters into [derivatives](../../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md)) on the [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) as soon as he discovers the mispriced value, and liquidates the position as soon as the assets price [returns](../../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) to the value he places on it. The active investor uses. what we call fundamental valuation methods. A passive investor believes in the wisdom of the markets or that active investors through their actions force the prices of assets to be at their fair fundamental value or the deviations are very short. The passive investor focuses on the long-term objectives of achieving the highest return compatible with his attitude toward. risk and consumption needs. He does not attempt to value investments in order to uncover mispricing. Rather he uses the information in the prices of assets to construct the best [portfolio](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) for himself that trades off [expected return](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) against risk over time. He uses tools like [portfolio](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). optimization and makes decisions on [asset allocation](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%202-%20Asset%20Allocation%20with%20Multiple%20Risky%20Assets.md) among many alternatives which often. result in diversified portfolios of many assets. Passive asset allocators subscribe to the twofund separation principle and pursue indexing in the risky part of their [portfolio](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). Recently,. the indexing trend has expanded beyond simple diversified portfolios of developed country. stocks and into global stock and bond portfolios and [commodities](../../PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). Also recently, a new blended breed of investors has emerged. These tactical allocation investors are neither active. nor passive. They believe that value discovery through fundamental valuation is difficult. But they also believe that long-term asset allocations based on broad indexing lead to inferior results. So they pursue monthly or quarterly rebalancing strategies, shifting in and out of.

sectors, geographies, or asset classes. Their decision algorithms blend technical trends with economic [fundamentals](../../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Lecture%20Notes%20Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Week%202/Week%202%20Fundamentals%20Of%20Forecasting.md). The newest super-active [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) strategy is algorithmic trading.. Here the investors do not perform fundamental [cash flow](../../PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) valuation analysis, but rely on. statistical within-asset-class co-movement modeling of all the stocks within a [stock market](../../PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) or individual currencies/[commodities](../../PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) within the entire [currency](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Forwards%20and%20Futures%20Notes.md)/commodity market. They. attempt to discover very short termed deviations (hourly, daily) of the prices from the overall movement of assets within the class. An example here is momentum investing. The model. may be purely statistical or blend in economic or accounting data. The last case in some sense amounts to relative rather than absolute fundamental asset valuation..  

This chapter outlines the current state of thinking in both the active and passive approach. to investing in the following order. We start with a historical perspective on the evolution of. [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) thought. We go through the basics of [free cash flow](../../PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2011%20-%20Individual%20Investors-A%20Survey%20of%20Modern%20Investment%20Theory/Free%20Cash%20Flow%20Valuation%20of%20Companies.md) discounting in stock valuation - something any entrant into [investment banking](../../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes%209-%20Corporate%20Securities%20And%20Credit%20Derivatives.md) must know, and should have learnt in college,. and then switch to the Modern [Portfolio Theory](../../PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2011%20-%20Individual%20Investors-A%20Survey%20of%20Modern%20Investment%20Theory/A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Investment%20Thought.md) of stock diversification. We end with "postmodern"' multifactor index and algorithmic models, and defer the discussion of alpha (reward for active skill) vs. beta (reward for factor risk) to Chapter 12 on [hedge funds](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md). [Hedge funds](../../../../Financial%20Engineering/Basis%20Trade%20Explainer.md) span passive and active investing. They often aim for alpha, but end up with beta..
