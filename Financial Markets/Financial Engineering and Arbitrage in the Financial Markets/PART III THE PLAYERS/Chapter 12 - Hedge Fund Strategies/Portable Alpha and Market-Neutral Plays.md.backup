# 12.2  PORTABLE ALPHA AND MARKET-NEUTRAL PLAYS  

Many [market-neutral funds](.md) are designed to appeal to a broad set of investors who make their own [asset allocation decisions](.md) and seek to find skilled managers to generate excess [returns](../../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md). Imagine a large US [pension fund](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) that follows a core-satellite approach to [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). For the first half of 2012, it allocates (core: beta) $30\%$ of its [portfolio](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) into US equities, $25\%$ into European equities, $25\%$ into emerging markets, $10\%$ into global [commodities](../../PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), and has (satellite: alpha) $10\%$ of its [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) dollars left to allocate to other asset classes. It comes across the [Clever Alpha Fund](.md) that specializes in identifying mispricing in the US ETF market. The fund's manager [Joe Saxon](.md) has developed an algorithm that signals when an ETF is underpriced relative to the underlying basket of stocks it holds. Saxon has a great track record in three US sectors - financial, tech, and biotech -- in identifying these discounts when they occur, but his algorithm does not work for overpricing situations. The [pension fund](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) decides to allocate $5\%$ of its [investment](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) dollars to Clever Alpha, but while they admire Saxon for his mispricing skills, they do not want him to take the general exposure to US equities. What if the underpricings happen before the general market drops? So while we buy a relatively cheap ETF full of US industrial or financial stocks at a discount to the net asset value, and while the fund's price "corrects up"' to the full NAV, the US market corrects down. Clever Alpha has a [portable alpha solution](.md) for that. It offers a market-neutral Clever Alpha ETF Neutral [Arbitrage](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) Fund in which it hedges its overall exposure to US equities with short S&P 500 [futures](../../PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md). The [pension fund](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2013/Uses%20of%20Interest%20Rate%20Swaps.md) can then manage its [asset allocation](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%202-%20Asset%20Allocation%20with%20Multiple%20Risky%20Assets.md) independent of its [specific security selection](.md). In the middle of 2012 it can decide to reduce the allocation to US equities from $30\%$ to $20\%$ or even to zero, but still retain the same $5\%$ in Clever Alpha. The process of separating the asset class exposure from specific risk plays is called alpha transfer..  

Let us explain the design of the Clever Alpha [ETF Neutral Arb Fund](.md) with the use of an index model. The sectors where the mispricings occur are cyclical, and so the overall beta. of the [portfolio](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is $\beta=1.25$ . The excess return on Clever Alpha can then be decomposed as. follows:  
$$
r_{C A l p h a}-r_{F}=\alpha+\beta(r_{S\&P500}-r_{F})+\tilde{e}
$$  

where $\alpha$ is the anticipated return due to the [ETF mispricing discovery](.md),. $r_{F}$ is the risk-free or [short-term financing](../../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%207-%20CP,%20Repo,%20and%20the%20Crisis/Asset%20Backed%20Commercial%20Paper%20Understanding%20the%20Risks.md) rate, and. $\tilde{e}$ is the residual reflecting unanticipated specific sector or component company risk. The [residual risk](../../PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/Residual%20Risk%20of%20Options%20Gamma%20Vega%20and%20Volatil.md) could be not insignificant if the chosen ETFs are very narrow, and one out of 10 stocks in an ETF explodes. In our case, the specific stock component of it is relatively small; it is more likely related to sector underperformance risk and could further be decomposed into, and mitigated by, short positions in sector index funds. If Clever Alpha employs $\$10$ million dollars to buy underpriced ETFs and S&P 500 futures currently trade at 1,250, we compute the right hedge ratio using the beta of the fund as $10,000,000\times1.25/1250\times250=40$ futures contracts. The hedging strategy is dynamic.. If, in September of 2012, the Clever Alpha algorithm signal is not strong and it wants to reduce the amount of purchased ETFs to only $\$8$ million, it will reduce its [futures](../../PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) hedge to. 32 contracts. Also, if it reallocates among sectors and more of its underpriced ETFs come. from tech increasing the overall beta of the fund to $\beta=1.50$ , then on $\$10$ million invested the [futures](../../PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md) hedge will increase to 48 contracts..  

The [portable alpha](../../PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%202%20-%20Spot%20Markets/Hedge%20Funds%20Alpha%20Beta%20and%20Strategy%20Indexes%20287.md) is delivered to the investor through the process of dynamically [hedging](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md). the changing nature of the underlying [portfolio](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) to offset the systematic beta risk of an asset. class. The objective of the [portfolio](../../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) remains unlocking the value due to specific risk, structural design, or relative value mispricing within that asset class. The investor can independently decide on the allocation of beta risks.
