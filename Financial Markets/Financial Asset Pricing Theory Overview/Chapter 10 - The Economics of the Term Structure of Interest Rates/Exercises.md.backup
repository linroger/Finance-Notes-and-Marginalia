# 10.10 Exercises  

EXERCISE 10.1 Show that if there is no [arbitrage](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) and the [short rate](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/An%20Overview%20of%20the%20Vasicek%20Short%20Rate%20Model.md) can never go negative,.   
then the [discount function](Basic%20Interest%20Rate%20Concepts%20and%20Relations.md) is non-increasing and all forward rates are non-negative.  

EXERCISE 10.2 Show Equation (10.51).  

EXERCISE 10.3 The [term premium](../../../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Table%20of%20Contents.md) at time $t$ for the future period $[t^{\prime},T]$ is the current [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) for that period minus the expected [spot rate](../../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md), i.e. $f_{t}^{t^{\prime},T}-\mathrm{E}_{t}[y_{t^{\prime}}^{T}]$ . This exercise will give a link between the [term premium](../../../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Table%20of%20Contents.md) and a [state-price deflator](.md) $\zeta=\left(\zeta_{t}\right)$  

(a) Show that  
$$
B_{t}^{T}=B_{t}^{t^{\prime}}\operatorname{E}_{t}\left[B_{t^{\prime}}^{T}\right]+\operatorname{Cov}_{t}\left[\frac{\zeta_{t^{\prime}}}{\zeta_{t}},\frac{\zeta_{T}}{\zeta_{t^{\prime}}}\right]
$$  

for any $t\leq t^{\prime}\leq T$  

(b) Using the above result, show that  
$$
\operatorname{E}_{t}\left[e^{-y_{t^{\prime}}^{T}(T-t^{\prime})}\right]-e^{-f_{t}^{t^{\prime},T}(T-t^{\prime})}=-{\frac{1}{B_{t}^{t^{\prime}}}}\operatorname{Cov}_{t}\left[{\frac{\zeta_{t^{\prime}}}{\zeta_{t}}},{\frac{\zeta_{T}}{\zeta_{t^{\prime}}}}\right].
$$  

Using the previous result and the approximation $e^{x}\approx1+x$ , show that  
$$
f_{t}^{t^{\prime},T}-\mathrm{E}_{t}[y_{t^{\prime}}^{T}]\approx-\frac{1}{(T-t^{\prime})B_{t}^{t^{\prime}}}\mathrm{Cov}_{t}\left[\frac{\zeta_{t^{\prime}}}{\zeta_{t}},\frac{\zeta_{T}}{\zeta_{t^{\prime}}}\right].
$$  

EXERCISE 10.4 The purpose of this exercise is to show that the claim of the gross return pure. expectation hypothesis is inconsistent with [interest rate uncertainty](.md). In the following we consider time points $t_{0}<t_{1}<t_{2}$  

(a) Show that if the hypothesis holds, then  
$$
\frac{1}{B_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}}=\frac{1}{B_{t_{0}}^{t_{2}}}\operatorname{E}_{t_{0}}\left[B_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\right].
$$  

Hint: Compare two [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) strategies over the period $[t_{0},t_{1}]$ .The first strategy is to buy.   
at time $t_{0}$ zero-coupon bonds maturing at time. $t_{1}$ .The second strategy is to buy at time. $t_{0}$   
zero-coupon bonds maturing at time $t_{2}$ and to sell them again at time. $t_{1}$  

(b) Show that if the hypothesis holds, then  
$$
\frac{1}{B_{t_{0}}^{t_{2}}}=\frac{1}{B_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}}\operatorname{E}_{t_{0}}\left[\frac{1}{B_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}}\right].
$$  

(c) Show from the two previous questions that the hypothesis implies that  
$$
\mathrm{E}_{t_{0}}\left[{\frac{1}{B_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}}}\right]={\frac{1}{\mathrm{E}_{t_{0}}\left[B_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\right]}}.
$$  

(d) Show that ( $^*$ ) can only hold under full certainty. Hint: Use [Jensen's inequality](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%208/Volatility%20and%20Convexity.md).  

EXERCISE 10.5 Show (10.63) and (10.64).  

EXERCISE 10.6 Go through the derivations in the subsection with the heading "An example" in Section 10.6.3.  

EXERCISE 10.7 Constantinides (1992) develops the so-called [SAINTS model](.md) of the [nominal term structure](.md) of [interest rates](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) by specifying exogenously the [nominal state-price deflator](Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md). $\ddot{\zeta}$ . In a  

slightly simplified version, his assumption is that  
$$
\tilde{\zeta}_{t}=k e^{-g t+(X_{t}-\alpha)^{2}},
$$  

where $k$ $g$ , and $\alpha$ are constants, and $X=\left(X_{t}\right)$ follows the [Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process](Equilibrium%20Interest%20Rate%20Models.md)  
$$
d X_{t}=-\kappa X_{t}d t+\sigma d z_{t},
$$  

where $\kappa$ and $\sigma$ are positive constants with $\sigma^{2}<\kappa$ and $z=\left(z_{t}\right)$ is a standard one-dimensional [Brownian motion](../Chapter%202%20-%20Uncertainty,%20Information,%20and%20Stochastic%20Processes/Continuous-Time%20Stochastic%20Processes.md)..  

(a) Derive the dynamics of the [nominal state-price deflator](Real%20and%20Nominal%20Interest%20Rates%20and%20Term%20Struc.md). Express the nominal [short-term interest rate](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Gauss%20Model.md), $\tilde{r}_{t}$ , and the nominal [market price of risk](.md), $\ddot{\lambda}_{t}$ , in terms of the variable $X_{t}$   
(b) Find the dynamics of the nominal [short rate](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/An%20Overview%20of%20the%20Vasicek%20Short%20Rate%20Model.md).   
(c) Find parameter constraints that ensure that the [short rate](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/An%20Overview%20of%20the%20Vasicek%20Short%20Rate%20Model.md) stays positive? Hint: The [short rate](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/An%20Overview%20of%20the%20Vasicek%20Short%20Rate%20Model.md) is a quadratic function of $X$ . Find the minimum value of this function.   
(d) What is the distribution of $X_{T}$ given $X_{t}$ \~.   
(e) Let $Y$ be a normally distributed random variable with mean $\mu$ and variance $v^{2}$ . Show that  
$$
\operatorname{E}\left[e^{-\gamma Y^{2}}\right]=(1+2\gamma v^{2})^{-1/2}\exp\left\{-{\frac{\gamma\mu^{2}}{1+2\gamma v^{2}}}\right\}.
$$  

(f) Use the results of the two previous questions to derive the time $t$ price of a nominal zero-. coupon bond with maturity. $T$ , i.e. $\tilde{B}_{t}^{T}$ . It will be an exponential-quadratic function of $X_{t}$ What is the yield on this bond?.  

(g) Find the percentage volatility. $\sigma_{t}^{T}$ of the price of the zero-coupon bond maturing at $T$  

(h) The instantaneous expected excess rate of return on the zero-coupon bond maturing at $T$ is often called the [term premium](../../../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Table%20of%20Contents.md) for maturity. $T$ . Explain why the [term premium](../../../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Table%20of%20Contents.md) is given by. $\sigma_{t}^{T}\ddot{\lambda}_{t}$ and show that the [term premium](../../../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Table%20of%20Contents.md) can be written as.  
$$
4\sigma^{2}\alpha^{2}\left(1-F(T-t)\right)\left(\frac{X_{t}}{\alpha}-1\right)\left(\frac{X_{t}}{\alpha}-\frac{1-F(T-t)e^{\kappa(T-t)}}{1-F(T-t)}\right),
$$  

where  
$$
F(\tau)=\frac{1}{\frac{\sigma^{2}}{\kappa}+\left(1-\frac{\sigma^{2}}{\kappa}\right)e^{2\kappa\tau}}.
$$  

For which values of $X_{t}$ will the [term premium](../../../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Table%20of%20Contents.md) for maturity $T$ be positive/negative? For a given state $X_{t}$ , is it possible that the the [term premium](../../../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Table%20of%20Contents.md) is positive for some maturities and negative for others?  

EXERCISE 10.8 Assume a [continuous-time economy](../Chapter%2011%20-%20Risk-adjusted%20probabilities/Risk-Neutral%20Probabilities.md) where the [state-price deflator](.md) $\zeta=\left(\zeta_{t}\right)$ has dynamics  
$$
d\zeta_{t}=-\zeta_{t}\left[r_{t}d t+\lambda d z_{1t}\right],
$$  

where $z_{1}=\left(z_{1t}\right)$ is a (one-dimensional) standard [Brownian motion](../Chapter%202%20-%20Uncertainty,%20Information,%20and%20Stochastic%20Processes/Continuous-Time%20Stochastic%20Processes.md), $\lambda$ is a constant, and $\boldsymbol r=(r_{t})$ follows the [Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process](Equilibrium%20Interest%20Rate%20Models.md)  
$$
d r_{t}=\kappa[\bar{r}-r_{t}]d t+\sigma_{r}d z_{1t}.
$$  

This is the [Vasicek model](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/Vasicek%20Short%20Rate%20Model.md) so we know that the prices of zero-coupon bonds are given by (10.37) and the corresponding yields are given by (10.39).  

Suppose you want to value a real uncertain [cash flow](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) of $F_{T}$ coming at time $T$ . Let $x_{t}=\operatorname{E}_{t}[F_{T}]$ and assume that  
$$
d x_{t}=x_{t}\left[\mu_{x}d t+\sigma_{x}\rho d z_{1t}+\sigma_{x}\sqrt{1-\rho^{2}}d z_{2t}\right],
$$  

where $\mu_{x}$ $\sigma_{x}$ , and $\rho$ are constants, and where. $z_{2}~=~(z_{2t})$ is another (one-dimensional) standard [Brownian motion](../Chapter%202%20-%20Uncertainty,%20Information,%20and%20Stochastic%20Processes/Continuous-Time%20Stochastic%20Processes.md) independent of $z_{1}$  

(a) Argue that $x=\left(x_{t}\right)$ must be a martingale and hence that $\mu_{x}=0$  

(b) Show that the time $t$ value of the claim to the [cash flow](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) $F_{T}$ is given by  
$$
V_{t}\equiv V(t,r_{t},x_{t})=x_{t}e^{-A(T-t)-B(T-t)r_{t}},
$$  

where $B(\tau)=b(\tau)$ and  
$$
A(\tau)=a(\tau)+\rho\lambda\sigma_{x}\tau+\frac{\rho\sigma_{x}\sigma_{r}}{\kappa}\left(\tau-b(\tau)\right).
$$  

(c) Write the dynamics of $V=\left(V_{t}\right)$ as $d V_{t}=V_{t}[\mu_{t}^{V}d t+\sigma_{1t}^{V}d z_{1t}+\sigma_{2t}^{V}d z_{2t}]$ . Use $(^{*})$ to identify $\mu_{t}^{V}$ $\sigma_{1t}^{V}$ , and $\sigma_{2t}^{V}$ . Verify that $\mu_{t}^{V}=r_{t}+\left(\pmb{\sigma}_{t}^{V}\right)^{\top}\lambda_{t}$ , where ${\pmb\sigma}^{V}=(\sigma_{1}^{V},\sigma_{2}^{V})^{\top}$ and $\lambda$ is the [market price of risk](.md) vector (the [market price of risk](.md) associated with $z_{2}$ is zero! Why?).  

(d) Define the risk-adjusted [discount rate](../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/PSET%207-%20Kohler.md). $R_{t}$ for the [cash flow](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) by the relation $V_{t}=\mathrm{E}_{t}[F_{T}]e^{-R_{t}[T-t]}$ What is the difference between $R_{t}$ and $y_{t}^{T}$ ? How does this difference depend on the [cash flow](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Preview%20of%20the%20Book.md) payment date $T$  

EXERCISE 10.9 Consider an economy with complete [financial markets](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) and a representative agent with [CRRA utility](../Chapter%208%20-%20Consumption-Based%20Asset%20Pricing/The%20Simple%20Multi-Period%20Ccapm.md), u(C) = q'-z, , where $\gamma>0$ , and a time [preference](../Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Utility%20Indices.md) rate of $\delta$ .The [aggregate consumption](../Chapter%207%20-%20Market%20equilibrium/Pareto-Optimality%20in%20Some%20Incomplete%20Markets.md) level $C$ is assumed to follow the [stochastic process](../../../The%20Ornstein-Uhlenbeck%20(OU)%20Process.md)  
$$
d c_{t}=c_{t}\left[\left(a_{1}X_{t}^{2}+a_{2}X_{t}+a_{3}\right)d t+\sigma_{c}d z_{t}\right],
$$  

where $z~=~\left(z_{t}\right)$ is a standard one-dimensional [Brownian motion](../Chapter%202%20-%20Uncertainty,%20Information,%20and%20Stochastic%20Processes/Continuous-Time%20Stochastic%20Processes.md) under the real-life probability measure $\mathbb{P}$ and where. $a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\sigma_{c}$ are constants with $\sigma_{c}~>~0$ .Furthermore, $X~=~\left(X_{t}\right)$ is a [stochastic process](../../../The%20Ornstein-Uhlenbeck%20(OU)%20Process.md) with dynamics  
$$
d X_{t}=-\kappa X_{t}d t+d z_{t}.
$$  

where $\kappa$ is a positive constant.  

(a) Show that the [short-term interest rate](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Gauss%20Model.md) is of the form $r_{t}=d_{1}X_{t}^{2}+d_{2}X_{t}+d_{3}$ and determine the constants $d_{1},d_{2},d_{3}$  

(b) Find a parameter condition under which the [short-term interest rate](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Gauss%20Model.md) is always non-negative.  

(c) Write up the dynamics of $r_{t}$ (d) What is the [market price of risk](.md) in this economy?  

Suppose that the above applies to the real economy and that money has no effects on the real economy. The [consumer price index](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Pricing%20an%20Inflation%20Swap.md) $F_{t}$ is supposed to have dynamics  
$$
d F_{t}=F_{t}\left[\mu_{\varphi t}d t+\rho_{C F}\sigma_{\varphi t}d z_{t}+\sqrt{1-\rho_{C F}^{2}}\sigma_{\varphi t}d\hat{z}_{t}\right],
$$  

where $\rho_{C F}$ is a constant correlation coefficient and $\hat{z}=(\hat{z}_{t})$ is another standard [Brownian motion](../Chapter%202%20-%20Uncertainty,%20Information,%20and%20Stochastic%20Processes/Continuous-Time%20Stochastic%20Processes.md) independent of $z$ . Assume that $\mu_{\varphi t}$ and $\sigma_{\varphi t}$ are on the form  
$$
\mu_{\varphi t}=b_{1}X_{t}^{2}+b_{2}X_{t}+b_{3},\qquad\sigma_{\varphi t}=k X_{t}.
$$  

(e) Write up an expression for the nominal [short-term interest rate](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Gauss%20Model.md), $\tilde{r}_{t}$  

Assume in the rest of the problem that $\gamma a_{1}+b_{1}=k^{2}$  

(f) Show that the nominal [short rate](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/An%20Overview%20of%20the%20Vasicek%20Short%20Rate%20Model.md) $\ddot{r}_{t}$ is affine in $X_{t}$ and express $X_{t}$ as an affine function of $\tilde{r}_{t}$   
(g) Compute the nominal [market price of risk](.md) $\tilde{\lambda}_{t}$   
(h) Determine the dynamics of the nominal [short rate](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/An%20Overview%20of%20the%20Vasicek%20Short%20Rate%20Model.md). The [drift and volatility](../../../Credit%20Markets/Black-Scholes%20Model.md) should be expressed in terms of $\ddot{r}_{t}$ , not $X_{t}$
