# 10.8 Liquidity preference, market segmentation, and preferred habitats  

Another traditional explanation of the shape of the yield curve is given by the liquidity preference hypothesis introduced by Hicks (1939). He realized that the expectation hypothesis basically ignores investors' aversion towards risk and argued that expected returns on long-term bonds should exceed the expected returns on short-term bonds to compensate for the higher price  

Huctuations of long-term bonds. According to this view the yield curve should tend to be increasing. Note that the word 'liquidity" in the name of the hypothesis is not used in the usual sense of the word. Short-term bonds are not necessarily more liquid than long-term bonds. A better name would be "the maturity preference hypothesis".  

In contrast the market segmentation hypothesis introduced by Culbertson (1957) claims that investors will typically prefer to invest in bonds with time-to-maturity in a certain interval, a maturity segment, perhaps in an attempt to match liabilities with similar maturities. For example,. a pension fund with liabilities due in 20-30 years can reduce risk by investing in bonds of similar. maturity. On the other hand, central banks typically operate in the short end of the market. Hence, separated market segments can exist without any relation between the bond prices and the. interest rates in different maturity segments. If this is really the case, we cannot expect to see. continuous or smooth yield curves and discount functions across the different segments..  

A more realistic version of this hypothesis is the preferred habitats hypothesis put forward. by Modigliani and Sutch (1966). An investor may prefer bonds with a certain maturity, but should. be willing to move away from that maturity if she is sufficiently compensated in terms of a higher yield.5 The different segments are therefore not completely independent of each other, and yields. and discount factors should depend on maturity in a smooth way..  

It is really not possible to quantify the market segmentation or the preferred habitats hypothesis without setting up an economy with individuals having different favorite maturities. The resulting. equilibrium yield curve will depend heavily on the degree of risk aversion of the various individuals as illustrated by an analysis of Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1981a)..  

# 10.9 Concluding remarks  

For models of the equilibrium term structure of interest rates with investor heterogeneity or more general utility functions than studied in this chapter, see, e.g., Duffie and Epstein (1992a), Wang (1996), Riedel (2000, 2004), Wachter (2006). The effects of central banks on the term structure are discussed and modeled by, e.g., Babbs and Webber (1994), Balduzzi, Bertola, and Foresi (1997), and Piazzesi (2001).
