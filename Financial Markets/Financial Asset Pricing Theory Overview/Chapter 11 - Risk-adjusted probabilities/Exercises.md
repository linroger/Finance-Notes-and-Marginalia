# 11.8 Exercises  

EXERCISE 11.1 Show that the Equations (11.8) and (11.9) are equivalent.  

EXERCISE 11.2 Take a continuous-time framework and assume that $\zeta=(\zeta_{t})_{t\in[0,T]}$ is a stateprice deflator. What is the. $\mathbb{Q}$ -dynamics of $\zeta\mathrm{^{\prime}}$  

EXERCISE 11.3 Consider Example 11.3. Compute the conditional $\mathbb{Q}^{2}$ -probabilities of the transitions over the second period of the tree. Compare with conditional $\mathbb{Q}$ -probabilities illustrated in Figure 11.2 and explain why they are (not?) different.  

EXERCISE 11.4 In the same two-period economy considered in Examples 11.2 and 11.3, compute the price of an asset giving a time 1 dividend of 0 in the upper or middle node and 1 in the lower node and a time 2 dividend of 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, or 5 from the top node and down (this is asset 3 in Exercise 4.8).
