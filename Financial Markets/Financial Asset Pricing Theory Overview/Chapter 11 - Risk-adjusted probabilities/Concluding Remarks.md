# 11.7 Concluding remarks  

This chapter has introduced several risk-adjusted probability measures and discussed the application of these measures in the [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] of assets. Each [[The Organization of This Book|risk-adjusted probability measure]] (in conjunction with the price process for the associated numeraire) is in a one-to-one relation with a [[Exercises|state-price deflator]]. The models for state-price deflators developed in the previous chapters are therefore also models concretizing the risk-adjusted probability measures. For example, the [[Concluding Remarks|consumption-based CAPM]] will define a [[Pricing Forwards, Futures, Bonds, Swaps, Swaptions, Caps and Floors under No-Arbitrage and Risk-Neutral Pricing|risk-neutral probability measure]] in terms of the (aggregate) consumption of a given (representative) individual. Any full factor [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] model will also nail down the [[Pricing Forwards, Futures, Bonds, Swaps, Swaptions, Caps and Floors under No-Arbitrage and Risk-Neutral Pricing|risk-neutral probability measure]].  

As discussed in Chapter 4, there is a distinction between real state-price deflators and nominal state-price deflators. Similarly, we can distinguish between a real [[Pricing Forwards, Futures, Bonds, Swaps, Swaptions, Caps and Floors under No-Arbitrage and Risk-Neutral Pricing|risk-neutral probability measure]] and a nominal [[Pricing Forwards, Futures, Bonds, Swaps, Swaptions, Caps and Floors under No-Arbitrage and Risk-Neutral Pricing|risk-neutral probability measure]]. The real (nominal, respectively) [[Pricing Forwards, Futures, Bonds, Swaps, Swaptions, Caps and Floors under No-Arbitrage and Risk-Neutral Pricing|risk-neutral probability measure]] is defined with a bank account yielding the real (nominal, respectively) shortterm [[Exercises|risk-free interest rate]] as the numeraire. In the same manner real and nominal forward measures are defined with a real and nominal, respectively, zero-coupon bond as the numeraire.
