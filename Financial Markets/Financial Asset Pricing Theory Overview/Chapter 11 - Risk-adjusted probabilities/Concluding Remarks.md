# 11.7 Concluding remarks  

This chapter has introduced several risk-adjusted probability measures and discussed the application of these measures in the pricing of assets. Each risk-adjusted probability measure (in conjunction with the price process for the associated numeraire) is in a one-to-one relation with a state-price deflator. The models for state-price deflators developed in the previous chapters are therefore also models concretizing the risk-adjusted probability measures. For example, the consumption-based CAPM will define a risk-neutral probability measure in terms of the (aggregate) consumption of a given (representative) individual. Any full factor pricing model will also nail down the risk-neutral probability measure.  

As discussed in Chapter 4, there is a distinction between real state-price deflators and nominal state-price deflators. Similarly, we can distinguish between a real risk-neutral probability measure and a nominal risk-neutral probability measure. The real (nominal, respectively) risk-neutral probability measure is defined with a bank account yielding the real (nominal, respectively) shortterm risk-free interest rate as the numeraire. In the same manner real and nominal forward measures are defined with a real and nominal, respectively, zero-coupon bond as the numeraire.
