# 11.7 Concluding remarks  

This chapter has introduced several risk-adjusted probability measures and discussed the application of these measures in the [pricing](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) of assets. Each [risk-adjusted probability measure](../Chapter%201%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Overview/The%20Organization%20of%20This%20Book.md) (in conjunction with the price process for the associated numeraire) is in a one-to-one relation with a [state-price deflator](Exercises.md). The models for state-price deflators developed in the previous chapters are therefore also models concretizing the risk-adjusted probability measures. For example, the [consumption-based CAPM](.md) will define a [risk-neutral probability measure](Pricing%20Forwards,%20Futures,%20Bonds,%20Swaps,%20Swaptions,%20Caps%20and%20Floors%20under%20No-Arbitrage%20and%20Risk-Neutral%20Pricing.md) in terms of the (aggregate) consumption of a given (representative) individual. Any full factor [pricing](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) model will also nail down the [risk-neutral probability measure](Pricing%20Forwards,%20Futures,%20Bonds,%20Swaps,%20Swaptions,%20Caps%20and%20Floors%20under%20No-Arbitrage%20and%20Risk-Neutral%20Pricing.md).  

As discussed in Chapter 4, there is a distinction between real state-price deflators and nominal state-price deflators. Similarly, we can distinguish between a real [risk-neutral probability measure](Pricing%20Forwards,%20Futures,%20Bonds,%20Swaps,%20Swaptions,%20Caps%20and%20Floors%20under%20No-Arbitrage%20and%20Risk-Neutral%20Pricing.md) and a nominal [risk-neutral probability measure](Pricing%20Forwards,%20Futures,%20Bonds,%20Swaps,%20Swaptions,%20Caps%20and%20Floors%20under%20No-Arbitrage%20and%20Risk-Neutral%20Pricing.md). The real (nominal, respectively) [risk-neutral probability measure](Pricing%20Forwards,%20Futures,%20Bonds,%20Swaps,%20Swaptions,%20Caps%20and%20Floors%20under%20No-Arbitrage%20and%20Risk-Neutral%20Pricing.md) is defined with a bank account yielding the real (nominal, respectively) shortterm [risk-free interest rate](Exercises.md) as the numeraire. In the same manner real and nominal forward measures are defined with a real and nominal, respectively, zero-coupon bond as the numeraire.
