# 8.9 Consumption-based asset pricing with incomplete markets  

# 8.9.1 Evidence of incomplete markets  

Some empirical [asset pricing](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing.md) studies indicate that markets are incomplete so that a [representative individual](The%20Simple%20Multi-Period%20Ccapm.md) may be non-existing. The [marginal rate of substitution](The%20One-Period%20Ccapm.md) of each individual defines a [state-price deflator](Exercises.md). It follows from Theorem 4.3 that a weighted average of state-price deflators is also a [state-price deflator](Exercises.md). Brav, Constantinides, and Geczy (2002) assume that all individuals have [time-additive CRRA utility](.md) with the same time [preference](../Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Utility%20Indices.md) rate $\delta$ and the same [relative risk aversion](CCAPM%20with%20Alternative%20Preferences.md) $\gamma$ so that the [state-price deflator](Exercises.md) for individual $\textit{l}$ is $e^{-\delta t}\left(c_{l t}/c_{l0}\right)^{-\gamma}$ . An equally-weighted average over $L$ individuals gives the [state-price deflator](Exercises.md)  
$$
\zeta_{t}=e^{-\delta t}\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^{L}\left(\frac{c_{l t}}{c_{l0}}\right)^{-\gamma}.
$$  

Using data on the consumption of individual households, the authors find that this [state-price deflator](Exercises.md) is consistent with the historical excess [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on the U.S. [stock market](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) for a risk aversion parameter as low as 3. If the market were complete, [consumption growth](Long-Run%20Risks%20and%20Epstein-Zin%20Utility.md) $c_{l t}/c_{l0}$ would be the same for all individuals under these assumptions, and  
$$
\zeta_{t}=e^{-\delta t}\left(\frac{\sum_{l=1}^{L}c_{l t}}{\sum_{l=1}^{L}c_{l0}}\right)^{-\gamma}
$$  

would be a valid [state-price deflator](Exercises.md). Summing up over all individuals in this formula, we get the [state-price deflator](Exercises.md) for a [representative individual](The%20Simple%20Multi-Period%20Ccapm.md), who will also have [relative risk aversion](CCAPM%20with%20Alternative%20Preferences.md) equal to $\gamma$ , but this is inconsistent with data except for unreasonably high values of $\gamma$ . This study therefore indicates that [financial markets](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) are incomplete and do not allow individuals to align their marginal rates of substitution.  

For various reasons, a large, but declining, fraction of individuals do not invest in stock markets at all or only to a very limited extent. Brav, Constantinides, and Geczy (2002) show that if in Equation (8.90) you only sum up over individuals holding financial assets with a value higher than some threshold, this [state-price deflator](Exercises.md) is consistent with historical data for a [relative risk aversion](CCAPM%20with%20Alternative%20Preferences.md) which is relatively high, but much lower than the required risk aversion using aggregate. consumption. The higher the threshold, the lower the required risk aversion. This result reflects that only the individuals active in the [financial markets](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions%20Lecture%20Notes.md) contribute to the setting of prices. Other empirical studies report similar findings, and Basak and Cuoco (1998) set up a formal [asset pricing](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing.md) model that explicitly distinguishes between individuals owning stocks and individuals not owning stocks.  

# 8.9.2 Labor income risk  

The labor income of individuals is not fully insurable, neither through investments in financial assets nor through existing [insurance contracts](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Risk%20Sharing.md). A number of papers investigate how non-hedgeable income shocks may affect the [pricing](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) of financial assets. If unexpected changes in labor income are temporary, individuals may self-insure by building up a buffer of savings in order to even out the consumption effects of the income shocks over the entire life. The effects on equilibrium asset prices will be insignificant, cf. Telmer (1993). If income shocks are to help resolve the [equity premium puzzle](.md), the shocks have to affect income beyond the current period. In addition, the magnitude of the income shocks has to be negatively related to the level of stock prices. Both the persistency of income shocks and the counter-cyclical variation in income seem reasonable in light of the risk of lay-offs and find empirical support, cf. Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron (2004). Individuals facing such an income uncertainty will demand higher risk premia on stocks than in a model without labor income because stocks do badly exactly when individuals face the highest risk of an unexpected decline in income.  

In a model where all individuals have [time-additive CRRA utility](.md), Constantinides and Duffie (1996) show by construction that if the income processes of different individuals are sufficiently. different in a certain sense then their model with any given risk aversion can generate basically any. pattern in [aggregate consumption](../Chapter%207%20-%20Market%20equilibrium/Pareto-Optimality%20in%20Some%20Incomplete%20Markets.md) and financial prices, including the puzzling historical pattern.. However, Cochrane (2001, Ch. 21) argues that with a realistic degree of cross-sectional variation in individual labor income, a relatively high value of the risk aversion parameter is still needed. to match historical data. Nevertheless, it seems to be important to incorporate the labor income uncertainty of individuals and in particular the difference between the labor income processes of different individuals in the development of better [asset pricing models](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md)..  

Constantinides, Donaldson, and Mehra (2002) emphasize that individuals choose consumption. and [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) from a life-cycle perspective and face different opportunities and risks at different ages. They divide individuals into young, middle-aged, and old individuals. Old individuals only.  

consume the savings they have build up earlier, do not receive further income and do not invest in financial assets. Young individuals typically have a low financial wealth and a low current labor income but a high human capital (the present value of their future labor income). Many young. individuals would prefer borrowing significant amounts both in order to smooth out consumption. over life and to be able to invest in the [stock market](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) to generate additional consumption opportunities and obtain the optimal risk/return trade-off. The empirically observed low correlation between labor income and stock [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) makes stock investments even more attractive for young individuals. Unfortunately it is difficult to borrow significant amounts just because you expect to get high future income and, therefore, the young individuals can only invest very little, if anything,. in the [stock market](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md). Middle-aged individuals face a different situation. Their future labor income is limited and relatively certain. Their future consumption opportunities are primarily depending on the return on their investments. For middle-aged individuals the correlation between stock [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) and future consumption is thus quite high so stocks are not as attractive for them. Nevertheless, due to the borrowing constraints on the young individuals, the stocks have to be owned by the middle-aged individuals and, hence, the equilibrium expected rate of return has to be quite high. The authors set up a relatively simple model formalizing these thoughts, and the model is able. to explain an [equity premium](Theory%20Meets%20Data%20-%20Asset%20Pricing%20Puzzles.md) significantly higher than in the standard model, but still below the. historically observed premium.  

# 8.10 Concluding remarks  

This chapter has developed consumption-based models of [asset pricing](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing.md). Under very weak assumptions, expected excess [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) on risky asset will be closely related to the covariance of the asset return with [aggregate consumption](../Chapter%207%20-%20Market%20equilibrium/Pareto-Optimality%20in%20Some%20Incomplete%20Markets.md), giving a conditional [consumption-based CAPM](../Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Concluding%20Remarks.md). The simple version of the model is unable to match a number of features of [consumption and return data](Long-Run%20Risks%20and%20Epstein-Zin%20Utility.md), which leads to several [asset pricing puzzles](Theory%20Meets%20Data%20-%20Asset%20Pricing%20Puzzles.md). However, a number of relatively recent theoretical and empirical studies identify extensions of the simple model that are able to eliminate (or at least reduce the magnitude of) several of these puzzles. These extensions include state-dependent preferences, heterogenous risk aversion, and [labor income risk](.md). The [consumption-based asset pricing](../Chapter%209%20-%20Factor%20Models/The%20Classical%20One-Period%20Capm.md). framework is alive and kicking. A potential problem of the tests and practical implementation of such models, however, is the need for good data on individual or [aggregate consumption](../Chapter%207%20-%20Market%20equilibrium/Pareto-Optimality%20in%20Some%20Incomplete%20Markets.md). The next chapter discusses [asset pricing models](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) not relying on consumption data..
