# 8.6 Problems with the empirical studies  

A number of issues should be taken into account when the conclusions of the empirical studies of the [consumption-based model](Theory%20Meets%20Data%20-%20Asset%20Pricing%20Puzzles.md) are evaluated. In the following we discuss some selected issues.  

Firstly, the 8% estimate of the average excess stock return is relatively imprecise. With 50 observations (one per year) and a standard deviation of 20%, the standard error equals $20\%/\sqrt{50}\approx$ 2.8% so that a $95\%$ confidence interval is roughly [2.5 $\%$ , 13.5%]. With a mean return of $2.5\%$ instead of $8.0\%$ , the required value of the [relative risk aversion](CCAPM%20with%20Alternative%20Preferences.md) drops to 31.25, which is certainly still very high but nevertheless considerably smaller than the original value of 100.  

Secondly, the consumption data used in the tests is of a poor quality as pointed out by e.g.  

Breeden, Gibbons, and Litzenberger (1989). The available data on [aggregate consumption](../Chapter%207%20-%20Market%20equilibrium/Pareto-Optimality%20in%20Some%20Incomplete%20Markets.md) measures the expenses for purchases of consumption goods over a given period (usually a quarter or a month). This is problematic for several reasons. Many, especially very expensive, consumption. goods are durable goods offering consumption "services" beyond the period of purchase. The model addresses the rate of consumption at a given point in time rather than the sum of consumption rates over some time interval; see Grossman, Melino, and Shiller (1987). The consumption data. is reported infrequently relative to financial data. Moreover, the [aggregate consumption](../Chapter%207%20-%20Market%20equilibrium/Pareto-Optimality%20in%20Some%20Incomplete%20Markets.md) numbers are undoubtedly subject to various sampling and measurement errors; see Wilcox (1992). These problems motivate the development of [asset pricing models](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) that do not depend on consumption at all. This is for example the case of the so-called factor models discussed in Chapter 9.  

Thirdly, also data for stock [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) has to be selected and applied with caution. Most tests of the [asset pricing models](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) are based on data from the U.S. or other economies that have experienced relatively high growth at least throughout the last 50 years. Probably investors in these countries were not so sure 50 years ago that the economy would avoid major financial and political crises and outperform other countries. Brown, Goetzmann, and Ross (1995) point out that due to this survivorship bias the realized stock [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) overstate the ex-ante expected rate of [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) significantly by maybe as much as 2-4 percentage points. Note however that in many crises in which stocks do badly, also bonds and deposits tend to provide low [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) so it is not clear how big the effect on the expected excess stock return is.  

Fourthly, the [pricing](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) relations of the model involve the ex-ante [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) of individuals, while the tests of the model are based on a single realized sequence of market prices and consumption. Estimating and testing a model involving ex-ante [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) and other moments requires stationarity in data in the sense that it must be assumed that each of the annual observations is drawn from the same probability distribution. For example, the average of the observed annual. [stock market](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) is only a reasonable estimate of the ex-ante expected annual [stock market](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) return if the [stock market](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20III%20THE%20PLAYERS/Chapter%2012%20-%20Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies/Hedge%20Fund%20Strategies.md) return in each of the 50 years is drawn from the same probability distribution. Some important changes in the [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) environment over the past years invalidate the stationarity assumption. For example, Mehra and Prescott (2003) note two significant changes in the U.S. tax system in the period between 1960 and 2000, a period included in most tests of the [consumption-based model](Theory%20Meets%20Data%20-%20Asset%20Pricing%20Puzzles.md):  

: The marginal tax rate for stock dividends has dropped from 43% to 17%. Stock [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) in most pension savings accounts are now tax-exempt, which was not so in the 1960s. Bond [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) in savings accounts have been tax-exempt throughout the period..  

Both changes have led to increased demands for stocks with [stock price](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20IV%20-%20Options/Chapter%2016%20-%20Blackâ€“Scholes%20Model.md) increases as a result. These changes in the tax rules were hardly predicted by investors and, hence, they can partly explain why the model has problems explaining the high realized stock [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md). Similarly, it can be argued that the reductions in direct and indirect transaction costs and the liberalizations of [international financial](../../../International%20Finance/Lecture%20Notes%20on%20International%20Finance.md) markets experienced over the last decades have increased the demands for stocks and driven up stock [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) above what could be expected ex-ante. The high transaction costs and restrictions on particularly [international investments](../../../International%20Finance/Globalization/Chapter%201-Introduction%20to%20Globalization.md) in the past may have made it impossible or at least very expensive for investors to obtain the optimal diversification of their investments so that even unsystematic risks may have been priced with higher required [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) as a consequence.1  

One can also argue theoretically that the [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) of a given stock cannot be stationary. Here is the argument: in each period there is a probability that the issuing firm defaults and the stock stops to exist. Then it no longer makes sense to talk about the return probability distribution of that stock. More generally, the probability distribution of the return in one period may very well depend on the [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) in previous periods.  

Fifthly, as emphasized by Bossaerts (2002), standard tests assume that ex-ante [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) of individuals are correct in the sense that they are confirmed by realizations. The general [asset pricing theory](../Chapter%209%20-%20Factor%20Models/Mean-Variance%20Efficient%20Returns%20and%20Pricing%20Fac.md) does allow individuals to have systematically over-optimistic or over-pessimistic [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md). The usual tests implicitly assume that market data can be seen as realizations of the ex-ante [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) of individuals. Bossaerts (2002) describes studies which indicate that this assumption is not necessarily valid.
