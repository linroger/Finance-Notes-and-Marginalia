# 9.6 Empirical factors  

A large part of the literature on factor models is based on empirical studies which for a given. data set identifies a number of priced factors so that most of the differences between the returns on different financial assets- -typically only various portfolios of stocks-can be explained by their different factor betas. The best known studies of this kind were carried out by Fama and French, who find support for a model with three factors:.  

[^1]: the return on a broad stock market index;
[^2]: the return on a portfolio of stocks in small companies (according to the market value of all stocks issued by the firm) minus the return on a portfolio of stocks in large companies;
[^3]: the return on a portfolio of stocks issued by firms with a high book-to-market value (the ratio between the book value of the assets of the firm to the market value of all the assets) minus the return on a portfolio of stocks in firms with a low book-to-market value.

According to Fama and French (1996) such a model gives a good fit of U.S. stock market data over. the period 1963-1993. However, the empirical analysis does not explain why this three-factor model does well and what the underlying pricing mechanisms might be. Also note that while a given. factor model does well in a given market over a given period it may perform very badly in other. markets and/or other periods (and risk premia may be different for other data sets). Some recent studies indicate that the second of the three factors (the "size effect"') seems to have disappeared. Another critique is that over the last 30 years empirical researchers have tried so many factors that it is hardly surprising that they have found some statistically significant factors. In fact, we know that in any given sample of historical returns it is possible to find a portfolio so that a factor model with the return on this portfolio as the only factor will perfectly explain all returns in the sample! Also note that the Fama-French model is a partial pricing model since the factors themselves are derived from prices of financial assets. For these reasons the purely empirically based "models" do not contribute much to the understanding of the pricing mechanisms of financial markets. However, some interesting recent studies explore whether the Fama-French factors can be seen as proxies for macro-economic variables that can logically be linked to asset prices.
