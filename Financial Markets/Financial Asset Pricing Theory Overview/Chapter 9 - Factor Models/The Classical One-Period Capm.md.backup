# 9.2 The classical one-period CAPM  

The [classical CAPM](.md) developed by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), and Mossin (1966) says that return on the market [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is a [pricing factor](Pricing%20Factors%20in%20a%20One-Period%20Framework.md) so that.  
$$
\mathrm{E}[R_{i}]=\alpha+\beta[R_{i},R_{M}]\left(\mathrm{E}[R_{M}]-\alpha\right),\quad i=1,2,\ldots,I,
$$  

for some [zero-beta return](Pricing%20Factors%20in%20a%20One-Period%20Framework.md) $\alpha$ , which is identical to the [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md) if such exists. Here the marketbeta is defined as $\beta[R_{i},R_{M}]=\mathrm{Cov}[R_{i},R_{M}]/\mathrm{Var}[R_{M}]$  

The [classical CAPM](.md) is usually derived from [mean-variance analysis](../../../Financial%20Engineering/2.%20Forwards,%20Swaps,%20Futures,%20and%20Options.md). If all individuals have quadratic utility or [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) are normally distributed, any individual will optimally pick a meanvariance efficient [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). If $R_{l}$ denotes the return on the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) chosen by individual $\textit{l}$ and $w_{l}$ denotes individual. $\textit{l}$ 's share of total wealth, the return on the market [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) will be $\begin{array}{r}{R_{M}=\sum_{l=1}^{L}w_{l}R_{l}}\end{array}$ and the market [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) will be [mean-variance](Exercises.md) eficient. As was already stated in Theorem 4.6 (demonstrated later in this chapter), the return on any [mean-variance](Exercises.md) efficient [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) will satisfy an equation like (9.1). In particular, this is true for the market [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) when it is efficient..  

To see how the [classical CAPM](.md) fits into the [consumption-based asset pricing](.md) framework, consider a model in which all individuals have [time-additive expected utility](../Chapter%208%20-%20Consumption-Based%20Asset%20Pricing/General%20Multi-Period%20Link%20Between%20Consumption%20a.md) and are endowed with some time 0 wealth but receive no time 1 income from non-financial sources. Let us consider an arbitrary individual with [initial wealth](../Chapter%206%20-%20Individual%20optimality/The%20One-Period%20Framework.md) endowment. $e_{0}$ . If the individual consumes $c_{0}$ at time 0 she will invest $e_{0}-c_{0}$ in the financial assets. Representing the [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) by the [portfolio weight vector](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Portfolios%20and%20Trading%20Strategies.md). $\pi$ , the gross return on the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) will be $\begin{array}{r}{R^{\pi}=\pi\cdot R=\sum_{i=1}^{I}\pi_{i}R_{i}}\end{array}$ . The time $^{1}$ consumption wil equal the total dividend of the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), which is the gross return multiplied by the initial [investment](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md), i.e.  
$$
c=R^{\pi}(e_{0}-c_{0}).
$$  

We can substitute this into the [marginal rate of substitution](../Chapter%208%20-%20Consumption-Based%20Asset%20Pricing/The%20One-Period%20Ccapm.md) of the individual so that the associated [state-price deflator](Exercises.md) becomes  
$$
\zeta=e^{-\delta}\frac{u^{\prime}(c)}{u^{\prime}(c_{0})}=e^{-\delta}\frac{u^{\prime}\left(R^{\pi}(e_{0}-c_{0})\right)}{u^{\prime}(c_{0})}.
$$  

If the economy has a [representative individual](../Chapter%208%20-%20Consumption-Based%20Asset%20Pricing/The%20Simple%20Multi-Period%20Ccapm.md), she has to own all the assets, i.e. she has to invest. in the market [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md). We can then replace. $R^{\pi}$ by $R_{M}$ , the gross return on the market [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md).. We can obtain the [classical CAPM](.md) from this relation if we either assume that the utility function is quadratic or that the return on the market [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) is normally distributed..  

Quadratic utility. The [quadratic utility function](.md) $u(c)~=~-(\bar{c}-c)^{2}$ is a special case of the. [satiation HARA utility](../Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Utility%20Functions%20in%20Models%20and%20in%20Reality.md) functions. Marginal utility $u^{\prime}(c)=2(\bar{c}-c)$ is positive for $c<c$ so that consumption in excess of. $c$ will decrease utility. Another problem is that the [absolute risk aversion](../Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Utility%20Functions%20in%20Models%20and%20in%20Reality.md) $\mathrm{ARA}(c)=1/({\bar{c}}-c)$ is increasing in the level of consumption. For quadratic utility, Eq. (9.2) becomes  
$$
\zeta=e^{-\delta}\frac{\bar{c}-R^{\pi}(e_{0}-c_{0})}{\bar{c}-c_{0}}=e^{-\delta}\frac{\bar{c}}{\bar{c}-c_{0}}-e^{-\delta}\frac{e_{0}-c_{0}}{\bar{c}-c_{0}}R^{\pi},
$$  

which is affine in the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) return. It now follows from the discussion in Section 4.6.2 (also see later section in the present chapter) that the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) return is a [pricing factor](Pricing%20Factors%20in%20a%20One-Period%20Framework.md) so that  
$$
\begin{array}{r}{\operatorname{E}[R_{i}]=\alpha+\beta[R_{i},R^{\pmb{\pi}}]\left(\operatorname{E}[R^{\pmb{\pi}}]-\alpha\right).}\end{array}
$$  

Again, if this applies to a [representative individual](../Chapter%208%20-%20Consumption-Based%20Asset%20Pricing/The%20Simple%20Multi-Period%20Ccapm.md), we can replace $R^{\pi}$ by the [market portfolio return](.md) $R_{M}$ and we have the [classical CAPM](.md).  

For the [quadratic utility function](.md) the absolute risk tolerance is $\operatorname{ART}(c)=-c+{\bar{c}}$ . If all individuals have quadratic utility functions (possibly with different $\bar{c}$ 's) and we assume that a [risk-free asset](../../../Financial%20Engineering/2.%20Forwards,%20Swaps,%20Futures,%20and%20Options.md) is traded and all time 1 endowments are spanned by traded assets, Theorem 7.6 implies that the [optimal consumption](../Chapter%206%20-%20Individual%20optimality/Dynamic%20Programming.md) of any individual is affine in the aggregate endowment and therefore it can be implemented by investing in a [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of the [risk-free asset](../../../Financial%20Engineering/2.%20Forwards,%20Swaps,%20Futures,%20and%20Options.md) and the market [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) of all assets. The return on the [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) will be a weighted average of the [risk-free return](../Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) and the market return, $R^{\pi}=w_{f}R^{f}+(1-w_{f})R_{M}$ , and substituting this into (9.3) we see that the [state-price deflator](Exercises.md) associated with any given individual will be affine in $R_{M}$ . Again, Theorem 9.3 will then give us the [classical CAPM](.md).  

Normally distributed [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md). We will show that for almost any utility function we can derive the [classical CAPM](.md) relation if [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) are jointly normally distributed. We need the following result called Stein's Lemma:  

Lemma 9.1 (Stein's Lemma) If $x$ and $y$ are jointly normally distributed random variables and $g:{\mathbb{R}}\rightarrow{\mathbb{R}}$ is a differentiable function with. $\operatorname{E}[|g^{\prime}(y)|]<\infty$ , then  
$$
\mathrm{Cov}[x,g(y)]=\mathrm{E}[g^{\prime}(y)]\mathrm{Cov}[x,y].
$$  

Proof: Define the random variable $\varepsilon$ by $\varepsilon=x-\alpha-\beta y$ , where $\beta=\mathrm{Cov}[x,y]/\mathrm{Var}[y]$ $\alpha=$ $\operatorname{E}[x]-\beta\operatorname{E}[y]$ , and $\mathrm{Cov}[\varepsilon,y]=0$ . Since $\varepsilon$ and $y$ are jointly normally distributed, the fact that they are uncorrelated implies that they will be independent. It follows that $\mathrm{Cov}[\varepsilon,g(y)]=0$ for any function $g$ . Therefore,  
$$
y)]=\beta\operatorname{Cov}[y,g(y)]+\operatorname{Cov}[\varepsilon,g(y)]=\beta\operatorname{Cov}[y,g(y)
$$  

Let us write the mean and variance of $y$ as $\mu_{y}$ and $\sigma_{y}^{2}$ , respectively. Then  
$$
\operatorname{Cov}[y,g(y)]=\operatorname{E}[y g(y)]-\operatorname{E}[y]\operatorname{E}[g(y)]=\operatorname{E}[(y-\mu_{y})g(y)]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(y-\mu_{y})g(y)f(y)d y,
$$  

where  
$$
f(y)=\frac{1}{\sigma_{y}\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp{\left\{-\frac{1}{2\sigma_{y}^{2}}(y-\mu_{y})^{2}\right\}}
$$  

is the probability density function of $y$ . Noting that $f^{\prime}(y)=-f(y)(y-\mu_{y})/\sigma_{y}^{2}$ , integration by. parts gives  
$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(y-\mu_{y})g(y)f(y)d y=-\sigma_{y}^{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(y)f^{\prime}(y)d y}}\ {{\displaystyle\qquad=\sigma_{y}^{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g^{\prime}(y)f(y)d y-\sigma_{y}^{2}\Big[g(y)f(y)\Big]_{y=-\infty}^{\infty}}}\ {{\displaystyle\qquad=\sigma_{y}^{2}\mathrm{E}[g^{\prime}(y)]}}\end{array}
$$  

provided that $g(y)$ does not approach plus or minus infinity faster than $f(y)$ approaches zero as $y\rightarrow\pm\infty$ . Hence,  
$$
\operatorname{Cov}[x,g(y)]=\beta\operatorname{Cov}[y,g(y)]=\beta\sigma_{y}^{2}\operatorname{E}[g^{\prime}(y)]=\operatorname{Cov}[x,y]\operatorname{E}[g^{\prime}(y)]
$$  

as claimed.  

For any [state-price deflator](Exercises.md) of the form $\zeta=g(x)$ where $x$ and $R_{i}$ are jointly normally distributed,. we thus have.  
$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{1=\mathrm{E}[g(x)R_{i}]=\mathrm{E}[g(x)]\mathrm{E}[R_{i}]+\mathrm{Cov}[g(x),R_{i}]}\ &{\phantom{=}=\mathrm{E}[g(x)]\mathrm{E}[R_{i}]+\mathrm{E}[g^{\prime}(x)]\mathrm{Cov}[x,R_{i}]}\ &{\phantom{=}=\mathrm{E}[g(x)]\mathrm{E}[R_{i}]+\mathrm{E}[g^{\prime}(x)]\mathrm{E}[(x-\mathrm{E}[x])R_{i}]}\ &{\phantom{=}=\mathrm{E}\left[\{\mathrm{E}[g(x)]-\mathrm{E}[x]E[g^{\prime}(x)]+\mathrm{E}[g^{\prime}(x)]x\right\}R_{i}]}\ &{\phantom{=}=\mathrm{E}[(a+b x)R_{i}],}\end{array}
$$  

for some constants $a$ and $b$ . Therefore, we can safely assume that $g(x)$ is affine in $x$  

In (9.2) we have  
$$
\zeta=e^{-\delta}\frac{u^{\prime}\left(R^{\pi}(e_{0}-c_{0})\right)}{u^{\prime}(c_{0})}=g(R^{\pi}),
$$  

and if the individual [asset returns](../Chapter%201%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Overview/Some%20Stylized%20Empirical%20Facts%20About%20Asset%20Retur.md) are jointly normally distributed, the return on any [portfolio](../../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) and the return on any individual asset will also be jointly normally distributed. According to Stein's Lemma we can then safely assume that $\zeta$ is affine in. $R^{\pi}$ . Again, this implies that. $R^{\pi}$ is a [pricing factor](Pricing%20Factors%20in%20a%20One-Period%20Framework.md). Note, however, that to apply Stein's Lemma, we have to check that $\operatorname{E}[|g^{\prime}(R^{\pi})|]$ is finite. In. our case,  
$$
g^{\prime}(R^{\pi})=e^{-\delta}(e_{0}-c_{0})\frac{u^{\prime\prime}\left(R^{\pi}(e_{0}-c_{0})\right)}{u^{\prime}(c_{0})}.
$$  

With log-utility, $u^{\prime\prime}(c)=-1/c^{2}$ , and since $\mathrm{E}[1/(R^{\pi})^{2}]$ is infinite (or undefined if you like) when $R^{\pi}$ is normally distributed, we cannot apply Stein's Lemma. In fact, when $R^{\pi}$ is normally distributed, we really need the utility function to be defined on the entire real line, which is not the case for the most reasonable utility functions. For [negative exponential utility](../Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Utility%20Functions%20in%20Models%20and%20in%20Reality.md), there is no such problem.  

The assumptions leading to the [classical CAPM](.md) are clearly problematic. Preferences are poorly represented by quadratic utility functions or other [mean-variance](Exercises.md) utility functions. [Returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) are not normally distributed. A more fundamental problem is the static nature of the one-period CAPM. Later in this chapter we will discuss how the CAPM can be extended to a dynamic setting. It turns out that we can derive an [intertemporal CAPM](Theoretical%20Factors.md) under much more appropriate assumptions about utility functions and return distributions. We will need [CRRA utility](../Chapter%208%20-%20Consumption-Based%20Asset%20Pricing/The%20Simple%20Multi-Period%20Ccapm.md) and lognormally distributed [returns](../Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md). In addition, we will need the return distribution to be stationary, i.e. the same for all future periods of the same length.
