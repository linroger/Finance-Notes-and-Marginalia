# 12.6 Concluding remarks  

This chapter has given an [introduction](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Introduction.md) to standard [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) and the [pricing](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) of such [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md). Numerous [continuous-time models](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Financial%20Mathematics%20Course.md) have been proposed in the literature for the [pricing](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) of [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) on stocks, [interest rates](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md), bonds, [commodities](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Futures%20Not%20Subject%20to%20Cash-And-Carry.md), foreign exchange, and other variables. Also many "[exotic](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Exotic%20Interest%20Rate%20Options.md)' variations of the basic [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) are traded and studied in the literature. In many cases the prices of some relevant [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) cannot be computed explicitly given the modeling assumptions found to be reasonable so the prices have to be computed by approximations or [numerical solution techniques](.md). The design of efficient computational techniques for [derivatives pricing](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Mathematics%20of%20the%20Financial%20Markets.md) is also an active research area..  

The interested reader can find much more information on [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) in specialized textbooks. such as Bjork (2004), Brigo and Mercurio (2001), Hull (2006), James and Webber (2000), Munk. (2005), Musiela and Rutkowski (1997). The market for [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) with payoffs depending on. credit events, such as the default of a given corporation, has been rapidly growing recently. Such [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) and their [pricing](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) are studied in textbooks such as Bielecki and Rutkowski (2002), Duffie. and Singleton (2003), Lando (2004), and Schonbucher (2003).
