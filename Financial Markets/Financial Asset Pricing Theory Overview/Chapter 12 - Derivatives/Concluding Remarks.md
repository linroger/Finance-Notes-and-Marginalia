# 12.6 Concluding remarks  

This chapter has given an introduction to standard derivatives and the pricing of such derivatives. Numerous continuous-time models have been proposed in the literature for the pricing of derivatives on stocks, interest rates, bonds, commodities, foreign exchange, and other variables. Also many "exotic' variations of the basic derivatives are traded and studied in the literature. In many cases the prices of some relevant derivatives cannot be computed explicitly given the modeling assumptions found to be reasonable so the prices have to be computed by approximations or numerical solution techniques. The design of efficient computational techniques for derivatives pricing is also an active research area..  

The interested reader can find much more information on derivatives in specialized textbooks. such as Bjork (2004), Brigo and Mercurio (2001), Hull (2006), James and Webber (2000), Munk. (2005), Musiela and Rutkowski (1997). The market for derivatives with payoffs depending on. credit events, such as the default of a given corporation, has been rapidly growing recently. Such derivatives and their pricing are studied in textbooks such as Bielecki and Rutkowski (2002), Duffie. and Singleton (2003), Lando (2004), and Schonbucher (2003).
