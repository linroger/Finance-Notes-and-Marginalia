# 12.6 Concluding remarks  

This chapter has given an [[Squam Lake Group Introduction|introduction]] to standard [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] and the [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] of such [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]]. Numerous [[Financial Mathematics Course|continuous-time models]] have been proposed in the literature for the [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] of [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] on stocks, [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]], bonds, [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|commodities]], foreign exchange, and other variables. Also many "[[Exotic Interest Rate Options|exotic]]' variations of the basic [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] are traded and studied in the literature. In many cases the prices of some relevant [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] cannot be computed explicitly given the modeling assumptions found to be reasonable so the prices have to be computed by approximations or [[Concluding Remarks|numerical solution techniques]]. The design of efficient computational techniques for [[Mathematics of the Financial Markets|derivatives pricing]] is also an active research area..  

The interested reader can find much more information on [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] in specialized textbooks. such as Bjork (2004), Brigo and Mercurio (2001), Hull (2006), James and Webber (2000), Munk. (2005), Musiela and Rutkowski (1997). The market for [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] with payoffs depending on. credit events, such as the default of a given corporation, has been rapidly growing recently. Such [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] and their [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] are studied in textbooks such as Bielecki and Rutkowski (2002), Duffie. and Singleton (2003), Lando (2004), and Schonbucher (2003).
