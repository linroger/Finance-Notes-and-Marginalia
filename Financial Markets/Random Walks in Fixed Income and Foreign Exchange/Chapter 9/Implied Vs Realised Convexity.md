# Chapter 9 Implied vs Realised Convexity

Chapter 8, when published as a Rates Radar, stirred many interesting discussions. We were motivated to expand our analysis to compare the theoretical or implied [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) value of a bond with the actual [realised convexity](.md) value over time.' We are able to show that this implied [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) value' is a good overall estimate of levels of [realised convexity](.md) value over a 1y horizon. For completeness, we repeat a small part of the derivation of the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) formulae here, though it is covered more thoroughly in Chapter 8.

Where does [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) value come from? The price of a bond changes with changes. in yield. However, this price change is non-linear, with the price being a convex function of the yield. Thus, the bond holder always does a little better under yield change. scenarios than a linear approximation would indicate. This non-linearity is the '[convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md)', and as longer-dated bonds are more sensitive to yield changes, they exhibit higher [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) than shorter-dated bonds. A bond or other instrument with high [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) is very desirable.

How large is [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) value? Though it's very common to hear that ultra-long. bonds are popular due to high [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md), it's rare to see numbers attached to this [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) value. In part, this is because it is a calculation involving a number of assumptions about future yield and volatility levels, so it can only ever be an estimate. Also, the calculation itself is somewhat complex; it can be done using finite differences, or by multiplying the PV of each cashflow by a factor connected with. yield and tenor. In Chapter 8, we showed that it is also possible to derive a closedform solution for [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md), though it is quite long. Thus, it tends to be discussed more qualitatively than quantitatively, which is a pity, as precise comparisons can be useful. In this chapter, we show how the value of [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) has changed over time for instruments of different tenors.

We compare implied and [realised convexity](.md). What is also very relevant for bond. holders, and also rarely seen, is a measure of how much [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) value a bond. turned out to generate. This will of course depend on yield and volatility changes. over the period in question, but it is of interest to see how accurate the 'implied'. [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) is, relative to the actual value realised over time. We calculate the implied [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) value for EUR instruments using two different methods: (1) using current. bond yields, and (2) using Bloomberg consensus forecast yields. We show that the two calculations lead to very similar estimates. We then compare this to the [realised convexity](.md) value over a 1y period, and show that with some variation, implied and realised values certainly fall into the same range. We show that the main drivers of. implied and [realised convexity](.md) value are [implied volatility](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/A%20Real-Life%20Option%20Pricing%20Exercise.md) and change in yield, respectively.

# Defining Convexity

[Convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) is the parameter defining the degree of non-linearity of the price of a bond with respect to yield. The price $P$ of a bond of $n$ years' tenor, yield $y$ and coupon $c$ is given by the following:
$$
P=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{\frac{c}{\left(1+y\right)^{i}}}+{\frac{c+100\%}{\left(1+y\right)^{n}}}
$$

If the yield of the bond changes, of course it is possible to recalculate the new price using this expression. However, it's not very intuitive to see how price and yield relate to each other from this. Thus, it is usually expressed as.
$$
P_{t}\approx P_{0}+D(y_{t}-y_{o})+\frac{1}{2}C(y_{t}-y_{o})^{2}
$$

where $\mathrm{P_{t}}$ is the price of the bond at time. $t,D$ is the [duration](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md), and. $C$ is the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md). $D$ and $C$ are of course the first and second [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md) of price with respect to yield, and have [closed-form solutions](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20IX%20-%20Fixed%20Income%20Derivatives/Chapter%2040%20-%20Pricing%20Fixed%20Income%20Options:%20Blackâ€™s%20Model%20and%20MCS.md), as follows:
$$
D=-\frac{1}{1+y}\left[\frac{1+y}{y}-\frac{1+y+n\left(c-y\right)}{c\left[\left(1+y\right)^{n}-1\right]+y}\right]
$$

and
$$
\begin{array}{l}{{C=\displaystyle\frac{c V^{4}}{\left(1-V\right)^{3}}\left[n\big(1-n\big)\big(1-V\big)^{2}V^{n-2}-2n V^{n-1}\big(1-V\big)+2\big(1-V^{n}\big)\right]}}\ {{\mathrm{~}+\displaystyle\frac{2c V^{3}}{\left(1-V\right)^{2}}\left[-n V^{n-1}\big(1-V\big)+\big(1-V^{n}\big)\right]+\big(1+c\big)\big(n+1\big)n V^{n+2}}}\end{array}
$$

where
$$
V={\frac{1}{1+y}}
$$

Thus, if an investor holds a bond, with known [duration](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) $D$ and [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) $C$ , they can predict the new price it will have at a future time when the yield has changed from $\mathrm{y_{0}}$ to $\mathrm{y_{t}}$

# Value of Implied Convexity

[Convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) C, as defined, is just a coefficient, not a value. What is the value of this nonlinearity? Clearly, the value of the third term in equation (2) depends on the change in yield, and so the expected value of the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) of a bond - over the. next year, for example - will depend upon the expected range of changes of yield. over that time.

Suddenly, now we have changed from our fairly deterministic expressions to something more related to averages, forecasts and statistics. Because we don't exactly know the future value of the bond yield, we can't definitively state what the value of the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) term will be. However, statistics comes to our aid, and if we know the future standard deviation $\upsigma_{\mathrm{y}}$ of the yield, we can say
$$
C o n\nu e x i t y~\nu a l u e=\frac{1}{2}~{\sigma_{y}}^{2}t\times C
$$

This makes a number of assumptions, none of which are unassailable. It assumes. that the future distribution of the yield is known, stationary and lognormal, all of which may be challenged. Nevertheless, it certainly serves to provide a useful estimate, and additionally, we do have a ready-made market estimate for. $\upsigma_{\mathrm{y}}$ in the form of the [swaption volatility](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2016/Swaption%20Skew.md) for the relevant tenor and time forward..

We need also to consider what value to use for the coupon of the bond. This. will enter the calculation of [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) value via equation (3). We can do two things. here - the first is to use the yield as the coupon, assuming that the curve will retain. its current form over the next year, and the second is to use a forecast value. To. obtain forecast values through history, we have created a series of 1y ahead forecasts from the Bloomberg consensus forecast series, which updates each quarter. This is only available for the 10y case, but nevertheless is useful..

Using all these assumptions, we can go back through history and extract yields. and swaption volatilities to create the graphs in Figures 9.1 and 9.2 of the implied. [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) value. Of course, we could also use different volatilities if we felt we could do better than the swaptions, but that starts to become fairly speculative..

Two things are worth noting here. The first is the difference in scale; the 5Oy in-. struments indeed have a far greater [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) value than the 10y case. The second is that there is almost no difference in using forecast yields vs assuming constant yields.. This is consistent with Chapter 8, in which we also showed that there was little difference if we used forward yields. The reason is that the main driver of implied [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md). value is the [implied swaption volatility](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Pricing%20a%20Callable%20Leveraged%20Constant%20Maturity%20Swap%20Spread%20Note.md), whose range of variation is vastly larger than the relatively modest adjustment in yields.

This is actually somewhat reassuring. When one realises that the implied [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) relies on so many different assumptions, it could be thought that there is little way. to obtain a reliable estimate. But when we realise that a single input, the future yield. volatility, dominates, at least we have narrowed the range of uncertainty..

# Value of Realised Convexity

We can now turn our attention to the actual realised value, which the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) has supplied in the past. The realised value of [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) is the performance of a bond. that occurs when yields change. In other words, it reflects the additional price gain. from the [duration](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) increase when yields fall, and the reduced price loss from the [duration](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%205/Key%20Rates%20O1s%20Durations%20and%20Hedging.md) decline when yields rise. This also explains that the realised value of [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) is always greater than zero and is zero when yields stay the same..

In algebraic terms, we use equations (1) and (2), restated here, to compute the realised value of [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md).
$$
\begin{array}{c}{{P=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\displaystyle\frac{c}{\left(1+y\right)^{i}}+\displaystyle\frac{c+100\%}{\left(1+y\right)^{n}}}}\ {{{}}}\ {{P_{t}\approx P_{0}+D(y_{t}-y_{o})+\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}C(y_{t}-y_{o})^{2}}}\end{array}
$$

Using equation (1), we find the exact value of the bond price one year ahead. Then we use equation (2), with $\mathrm{P}_{0}$ taken as the bond price at the start of the year, and. $D$ and $C$ the [duration and convexity](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%208/An%20Analytical%20Decomposition%20of%20Forward%20Rates.md) at the start of the year. Using these values, together with the change in yield over the course of the year, we hope to use the price calculated with equation (2) to match up with that calculated with equation (1).

In Figure 9.3, we see the results. The solid grey line, hardly visible, is the [full price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%201/Accrued%20Interest.md) calculation at the end of the 1y period using equation (1). The black line, again not very visible, is the price calculated using only the first two terms of equation (2). It can be seen that it does not match perfectly to the full calculation. The dashed light grey line is the price calculated using all three terms in equation (2), including the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) value. It can be seen that the inclusion of this final term is a better approximation to the true price.

Finally, the dark grey dashed line at the bottom of the chart, which is charted using the axis on the right, is the [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) value term on its own - that is, just the third term of equation (2).
$$
C o n v e x i t y~\nu a l u e=\frac{1}{2}C(y_{t}-y_{o})^{2}
$$

This is the [realised convexity](.md), and is primarily driven by the change in yield over the course of the year. For this long 50y instrument, it can be seen that it is large, over $10\%$ at times.

Finally, we can graph implied vs [realised convexity](.md) together, as in Figure 9.4.. We see that while we would hardly expect implied [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) to accurately indicate. changes in [realised convexity](.md), the overall levels of [realised convexity](.md) oscillate. around implied, and on the whole it appears to be a reasonable estimate. Note that the near-zero levels of [realised convexity](.md) occur when the change in yield over. the course of the year is close to zero..

These calculations emphasise the importance of the ultra-long end of the curve. Our graph in Figure 9.5 shows the [realised convexity](.md) value for 10, 30 and 50y maturities. While [realised convexity](.md) for the 10y case peaks at. $1.25\%$ , for the 50y case, we see close to $20\%$ , which is very significant.

Finally, we take a look at [realised convexity](.md) value over different timescales. So. far, our analysis has concentrated on a 1y period, but it is also interesting to focus. on shorter periods. In Figure 9.6, we plot the [realised convexity](.md) value over 1y, 6m and $3\mathrm{m}$ periods for a 30y bond. It can be seen that even over shorter periods, the. [convexity](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Problem%20Sets/PSET%20II%20Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing%201.md) value can be considerable when there is substantial yield variation..
