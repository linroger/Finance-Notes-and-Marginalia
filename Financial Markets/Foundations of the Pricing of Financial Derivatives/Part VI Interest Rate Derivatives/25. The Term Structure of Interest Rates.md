# The Term Structure of Interest Rates  

he [term structure of interest rates](../../../Financial%20Engineering/6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md) is the relationship between the interest rate on a bond or loan and the maturity.1 The [term structure](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) is often depicted with a graph, sometimes called a yield curve. A typical question raised by the [term structure](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) is whether long-term rates are more than [short-term rates](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%208/Volatility%20and%20Convexity.md) and, if so, why? Of course, the issue is a bit more complex than that. The maturities of loans and bonds span a range from very short term, as short perhaps as a day, to very long term, such as 30 years or more. Maturities cannot simply be dichotomized into short and long term. And it is difficult to make general statements, such as longer-term rates are higher than shorter-term rates. That might be true, but there can be more complex relationships between rates and maturities. Hence, there could be low [short-term rates](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%208/Volatility%20and%20Convexity.md), high intermediate-term rates, and low long-term rates, with bumps and dips in between. And, of course, the words low and high are relative and might mean different things to different people. Figure 25.1 illustrates three potential patterns for the [term structure of interest rates](../../../Financial%20Engineering/6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md). The top line depicts a common upward sloping yield curve and the bottom depicts a downward sloping yield curve. The middle curve illustrates that other patterns that are not necessarily upward or downward are also possible.  

In general, however, we use the [term structure](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) to think about how rates of various maturities might differ. As we discussed in Chapter 22, the rate on a loan or bond of one maturity can be related to the rate on a loan or bond of a shorter-term maturity to produce a [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md). For example, let us say that the rate on a five-year zero-coupon bond is $7.2\%$ , annual compounding, and the rate on a two-year zero-coupon bond is $6.9\%$ . The [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) is found as follows:  
$$
F=\sqrt[3]{\frac{(1.072)^{5}}{(1.069)^{2}}}-1=0.074.
$$  

Much of the study of the [term structure](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) is about understanding what that [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) might mean. We have already seen that it means that one could today enter into a contract to borrow or lend for three years with the loan starting two years from now. The rate would be agreed on today. There are some opinions that this number might tell us something about the direction of future [interest rates](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md). We explore this issue in this chapter.2  

Almost anyone who has studied the [term structure of interest rates](../../../Financial%20Engineering/6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md), perhaps through a course in [fixed income markets](../../../Financial%20Engineering/A%20Practical%20Guide%20to%20Bonds%20and%20Swaps.md), is familiar with the unbiased [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) (UEH),3 which proposes that the [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) is an unbiased predictor of the future [spot rate](../../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md). Thus, the [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) is seen as the expected [spot rate](../../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md). The question of whether the

FIGURE 25.1 [Term Structure of Interest Rates](../../../Financial%20Engineering/6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md) Illustration  

UEH is true has occupied a central place in research in our body of understanding of the [term structure](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md), in particular in empirical research. There is no clear consensus empirically, but in fact it is a simple matter to prove that the unbiased [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) cannot be true theoretically and almost surely cannot be true in reality.4  

# 25.1 THE UNBIASED EXPECTATIONS HYPOTHESIS  

Let us start by defining $S_{0}$ and $F_{0}$ as the spot and forward prices for an asset.5 The [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) is for a [forward contract](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) that expires one period later and requires delivery of the [underlying asset](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Financial%20Derivatives%20and%20Quantitative%20Methods/Risk%20Neutral%20Pricing%20of%20Options.md). In other words, one enters into a contract to purchase the asset one period later, paying the price $F_{0}$ , which is determined when the contract is created. Unless otherwise stated, we assume annual time increments, so time 1 occurs in 1 year. Thus, we can set aside compounding issues $(\tau=1$ ).  

Now let us move ahead to time 1, at which time the spot price is $S_{1}$ . To avoid the existence of any [arbitrage opportunities](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md), the [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) at expiration must converge to the spot price. Therefore,  
$$
F_{1}=S_{1}.
$$  

In a technical sense, the [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) $F_{1}$ is the price of a contract expiring instantaneously. Therefore, it has to be the spot price. That is, a [forward contract](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) calling for instantaneous payment and delivery of the asset is a [spot transaction](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Futures%20and%20Forwards.md), because a [spot transaction](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Futures%20and%20Forwards.md) calls for instantaneous payment and delivery of the asset.  

At time 0, the expected spot price at time 1 is denoted as $E_{0}(S_{1})$ . As such, with $F_{1}=S_{1}$ ,  
$$
E_{0}(S_{1})=E_{0}(F_{1}).
$$  

The unbiased [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) states that the [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) is the expected spot price. Formally,  
$$
F_{0}=E_{0}(S_{1}).
$$  

Let us now see why this statement cannot be true. By definition, today’s spot price of any asset is the expected [future spot price](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) minus the risk premium, with this  

value discounted back to the present at the [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md). Let us write this statement as follows:  
$$
S_{0}=e^{-r_{c}}[E_{0}(S_{1})-\lambda],
$$  

where $r_{c}$ is the one-period [continuously compounded interest](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/Solutions/PSET%207%20Solutions-Financial%20Instruments.md) rate and $\lambda$ is the dollar risk premium. At this point, we do not specify what the risk premium is. For example, we do not require that it derives from the [capital asset pricing model](../../../Financial%20Engineering/2.%20Forwards,%20Swaps,%20Futures,%20and%20Options.md). We simply define it in general terms. It is the amount in money by which the future [asset price](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md) is reduced to induce someone to buy the asset. Equation (25.4) must hold because rational investors require ex ante compensation for the opportunity cost of funds tied up in the risky asset as well as compensation for the assumption of risk. Also, note that the bracketed term is the risk-adjusted expected value at time 1, and it is, therefore, appropriate to discount this value for one period at the [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md). Equation (25.4) is what we call a [certainty equivalent](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Risk%20Aversion.md), because it is the amount of money we would take for certain in lieu of facing a risk.  

It is a well-known fact that to prevent [arbitrage](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md), a [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) must equal the spot price compounded at the [risk-free interest rate](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md). This is the basic cost of carry [pricing](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) model for a [forward contract](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md),6  
$$
F_{0}=S_{0}e^{r_{c}}.
$$  

As such, we can restate Equation (25.5) as  
$$
S_{0}=F_{0}e^{-r_{c}}.
$$  

Substituting Equation (25.6) into Equation (25.4) gives  
$$
\begin{array}{r}{F_{0}=E_{0}(S_{1})-\lambda.}\end{array}
$$  

In other words, the [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) is the expected spot price minus a risk premium. The existence of a positive risk premium makes the [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) a biased estimate of the expected spot price, thereby invalidating the unbiased [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md). Note that the bias is on the low side, assuming a positive risk premium. That is, the [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) will understate the expected spot price by the amount of the risk premium.  

For further proof, let us suppose that the [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) is unbiased. That is, assume Equation (25.3) holds. By definition, the spot price is the expected [future spot price](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md) discounted at a risky rate, which we shall denote as $k$ . That is,  
$$
S_{0}=E_{0}(S_{1})e^{-k}.
$$  

If the unbiased [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) were correct, then substitute Equation (25.3) into Equation (25.8), and we obtain the result that  
$$
S_{0}=F_{0}e^{-k}.
$$  

But we know that to prevent [arbitrage](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md), Equation (25.5) must hold. This implies that $k=r_{c}$ . That is, the rate at which a risky future value must be discounted would be the [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md). Moreover, this statement would be true for any asset. So, if the unbiased [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) were true, the risky [discount rate](../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/Problem%20Sets/PSET%207-%20Kohler.md) would be the same for every asset and equal to the [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md). Except in the uninteresting cases of no risk or investors being [risk neutral](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%207-Exotic%20Options%20And%20Derivative%20Pricing%20By%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation.md), this statement obviously cannot be true.  

As we now turn to forward [interest rates](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md), we will need slightly more precise notation because forward [interest rates](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) have a current date, the time until the interest rate period starts, and the time until the interest rate period ends. To refresh your memory, a [forward contract](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) is established at one point in time and fixes the rate on a [spot transaction](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Futures%20and%20Forwards.md) that begins at another point in time, accrues interest, and ends at a later point in time. Further, we distinguish between the [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) (uppercase $F$ ) and the forward rates (lowercase $f$ ). We shall standardize things by using forward rates covering only one period but up to $j$ periods ahead. Thus, $f(t,t+j)$ denotes the continuously compounded one-period [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) observed at time $t$ for a [spot transaction](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%203%20-%20Futures%20Markets/Fundamentals%20of%20Futures%20and%20Forwards.md) that starts at time $t+j$ , $r(t+j,t+j+1)$ denotes the continuously compounded single-period [spot rate](../../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) over the period $t+j$ to $t+j+1$ , and $H P R(t,t+1,j)$ denotes the continuously compounded [holding period return](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Yield%20and%20Return.md) over the period $t$ to $t+1$ for a $j$ -maturity bond.  

Within the context of [interest rates](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md), the unbiased [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) states that forward rates are unbiased predictors of future spot rates. If UEH holds, then the [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) is the best estimate of expected future spot rates. Based on our notation, we have  
$$
\mathrm{UEH:~}f(t,t+j)=E_{t}[r(t+j,t+j+1)];j=1,...,n,
$$  

where $f(t,t+j)$ denotes the continuously compounded one-period [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) observed at time $t$ for a transaction that starts at time $t+j$ and $r(t+j,t+j+1)$ denotes the continuously compounded single period [spot rate](../../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) over the period $t+j$ to $t+j+1$ . See, for example, Lutz (1940), [Culbertson](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Liquidity%20Preference%20Market%20Segmentation%20and%20P.md) (1957), Campbell and Shiller (1987), Engsted and Tanggaard (1994, 1995), and Lund (1993).  

# 25.2 THE LOCAL EXPECTATIONS HYPOTHESIS  

A similar sounding but more valid hypothesis for our purposes is the local [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) (LEH). In its most general form, the LEH states that all bonds have the same expected [holding period return](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Yield%20and%20Return.md) over the next period. Based on our notation, we have  
$$
\mathrm{LEH}\colon E_{t}[H P R(t,t+1,j)]=r(t,t+1);j=1,\ldots,n,
$$  

where $H P R(t,t+1,j)$ denotes the continuously compounded [holding period return](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Yield%20and%20Return.md) over the period $t$ to $t+1$ for a $j$ -maturity bond and $\textstyle r(t,t+1)$ denotes the continuously compounded single-period [spot rate](../../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) over the period $t$ to $t+1$ . See Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1981, 1985a, 1985b) and Ingersoll (1987), where they compare the different versions of the [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md), arguing that they are different in continuous and discrete time.  

The LEH originates from a bond market in which the [term structure](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) does not permit investors to trade bonds to create [arbitrage](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) profits. In fact, the LEH is equivalent to the [absence of arbitrage](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) in the bond market. More formally, the LEH states that in the [absence of arbitrage](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) opportunities, the [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) of a zero-coupon bond will equal the expected spot price if the expected spot price is taken under the equivalent martingale probabilities, which are the artificial probabilities whose existence is guaranteed if there are no [arbitrage opportunities](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%208-%20Markets,%20Meltdowns,%20and%20Arbitrage/Class%20Note%2013%20The%20LTCM%20Meltdown.md). The equivalence of the [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) and expected spot price is, however, true only for one-period-ahead forward prices. In other words, the [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) of an $n$ -period bond equals the expected spot price looking only one period ahead but no further. The expected [returns](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md), taken using the martingale probabilities, of any strategies involving any bonds of any maturity, are equivalent and equal to the one-period [spot rate](../../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md), that is, the shortest interest rate in the market.  

The reason the LEH holds only for one period ahead is that a true [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md) exists only for the shortest holding period. One might think that a long-term zero-coupon bond rate is risk-free, but [interest rates](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) change during the life of the bond, causing its value to fluctuate. The only true [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md) is over the shortest holding period. When we study [interest rates](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) in a continuous time world, we shall see that this shortest holding period is an instant.  

We shall demonstrate the LEH in a simple [binomial](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%205%20Options%20on%20Prices%20and%20Hedge-Based%20Valuation/A%20Real-Life%20Option%20Pricing%20Exercise.md) world. The extension to a more complex continuous time model is feasible but a bit more difficult. We shall use continuously compounded rates, but the proof can be easily restructured for simple rates. For our notation, let $B(a,b)$ be the price at time $a$ of a zero-coupon bond maturing at time $b$ . Let $r_{c}(a,b)$ be the rate observed on a bond at time $a$ that matures at time $b$ . When $a=0$ , this is a spot bond and a [spot rate](../../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md). For example, consider a one-period bond, whose price is given as  

Price at time 0 of bond maturing at time 1  
$$
B(0,1)=e^{-r_{c}(0,1)}.
$$  

The value of this bond one period later is  

Value at time 1 of bond maturing at time 1  
$$
B(1,1)=1.
$$  

Consider a two-period bond whose price is given as  

Price at time 0 of bond maturing at time 2  
$$
B(0,2)=e^{-2r_{c}(0,2)}.
$$  

Its value one period later is  

Price at time 1 of bond maturing at time 2  
$$
B(1,2)=e^{-r_{c}(1,2)}.
$$  

Now, let us introduce some uncertainty into the market. We assume that the one-period rate, $r_{c}(0,1)$ can go up to $r_{c}(1,2)^{+}$ or down to $r_{c}(1,2)^{-}$ . Thus, one period later, the original two-period bond becomes a one-period bond with a price of  
$$
B(1,2)^{+}=e^{-r_{c}(1,2)^{+}}
$$  
$$
B(1,2)^{-}=e^{-r_{c}(1,2)^{-}}.
$$  

That is, we are now introducing uncertainty into the model in the form of two possible one-period future [interest rates](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md). The market moves one step forward, which produces a new interest rate, and, therefore, a new bond price, which can be either of the two previous outcomes.  

Now, let us consider how we could hold a bond for one period, without investing any money of our own. That is, we want a self-financing strategy. One way is that we could buy a one-period bond, financing it by selling an equivalent dollar amount of two-period bonds. When the one-period bond matures, we would pay off the two-period bonds. Alternatively, we could buy a two-period bond, financing it by selling an equivalent dollar amount of one-period bonds, and then sell the bond after one period.  

For the first strategy, an [arbitrage](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) profit would be ensured if the rate of return $r_{c}(0,1)$ on the bond purchased is guaranteed to exceed the cost of financing it. Remember that the bond is financed by borrowing a two-period bond and buying it back one period later. This means that the financing strategy has an uncertain cost. That cost will be determined based on what the new one-period interest rate is. But if it were the case that the cost, in the worst-case scenario, is still less than the rate of return on the bond we buy, then we have earned an [arbitrage](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) profit. The worst-case scenario would be for the one-period rate to go down. This would drive up the price of the two-period bond that we sold to finance the position. Thus, the two-period bond, which then becomes a one-period bond, has a new price of $B(1,2)^{-}$ . The cost of the transaction expressed as one plus the percentage cost would be  
$$
{\frac{B(1,2)^{-}}{B(0,2)}}.
$$  

Hence, an [arbitrage](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) profit would be earned if  
$$
e^{r_{c}(0,1)}>{\frac{B(1,2)^{-}}{B(0,2)}}.
$$  

The left-hand side (LHS) is one plus the return from buying the one-period bond. The right-hand side (RHS) is the highest possible cost of financing the bond.  

In the second strategy, we are buying a two-period bond, financing it with a one-period bond. Therefore, the [financing cost](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Realized%20Returns.md) is $r_{c}(0,1)$ for sure, but the return on the bond purchased is unknown. The worst-case scenario is for the one-period rate to go up, driving down the price of the two-period bond to its worst value, $B(1,2)^{+}$ . Therefore, one plus the worst one-period return on a two-period bond would be  
$$
{\frac{B(1,2)^{+}}{B(0,2)}}.
$$  

Therefore, an [arbitrage](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) profit would occur if  
$$
e^{r_{c}(0,1)}<{\frac{B(1,2)^{+}}{B(0,2)}}.
$$  

Thus, to prevent [arbitrage](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md), neither of these conditions must occur. Therefore, we must have  
$$
\frac{B(1,2)^{+}}{B(0,2)}<e^{r_{c}(0,1)}<\frac{B(1,2)^{-}}{B(0,2)}.
$$  

This statement implies that there is a set of weights, which we shall call $\phi$ and $1-\phi$ , such that  
$$
\phi\frac{B(1,2)^{+}}{B(0,2)}+(1-\phi)\frac{B(1,2)^{-}}{B(0,2)}=e^{r_{c}(0,1)}.
$$  

The LHS can be viewed as a type of [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) on a two-period bond held for one period, which is then set equal to the RHS, which is the one-period rate. To interpret the LHS as an expected value, however, we must recognize these weights as [risk neutral](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%207-Exotic%20Options%20And%20Derivative%20Pricing%20By%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation.md) or equivalent martingale weights. We call them [risk neutral](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%207-Exotic%20Options%20And%20Derivative%20Pricing%20By%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation.md) because the expression is the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) that a risk-neutral investor would have. These are, therefore, the probabilities that would be used if current market prices held and investors were [risk neutral](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%207-Exotic%20Options%20And%20Derivative%20Pricing%20By%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation.md). They are also called equivalent martingale probabilities because they convert the discounted bond price into a martingale, which is a [stochastic process](../../../The%20Ornstein-Uhlenbeck%20(OU)%20Process.md) with zero [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md). You should recall that we studied this concept extensively when developing the procedures for [pricing](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) options.  

Of course, a martingale is a process with an [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) of zero. Equation (25.22) does not on the surface appear to be a martingale, because it shows that the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) is the [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md). Because the [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md) is known and constant, it is a simple matter to convert (25.22) to a martingale by dividing by $e^{r_{c}(0,1)}$ , which is the same thing as multiplying by $B(0,1)$ . Hence, any process that has an [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) equal to the [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md) can be viewed as a martingale.  

To generalize this result, we could let the two-period bond be a bond of any maturity, say n. Then repeat the previous exercise, and we would easily see that the same result is obtained. A more formal proof can demonstrate that there is no bond trading strategy that permits [arbitrage](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md).  

The result that the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md), under the martingale probability, equals the one-period rate does not, however, apply to a strategy that spans more than one period. As noted, the reason for this result is that [arbitrage](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) is a risk-free strategy and there is no true [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md) beyond one period. Although buying a zero-coupon bond of maturity $n>1$ and holding it to maturity indeed leads to a [risk-free return](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%204%20-%20State%20Prices/A%20Preview%20of%20Alternative%20Formulations.md), [arbitrage strategies](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%201%20-%20Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets/Purpose%20and%20Structure%20of%20Financial%20Markets%201.md) require a rebalancing of the positions to properly offset the changing risk of the component instruments. This rebalancing requires trading in intermediate periods.  

We have now demonstrated that the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md), using the martingale probabilities, equals the one-period rate. Next we demonstrate the other implication of the LEH, that the expected price of the two-period bond at time 1 is the [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md). Let us express Equation (25.22) as follows:  
$$
\phi\frac{B(1,2)^{+}}{B(0,2)}+(1-\phi)\frac{B(1,2)^{-}}{B(0,2)}=\frac{1}{B(0,1)},
$$  

noting that $1/B(0,1)$ is $e^{r_{c}(0,1)}$ . Multiplying both sides by $B(0,2)$ , we obtain  
$$
\phi B(1,2)^{+}+(1-\phi)B(1,2)^{-}=\frac{B(0,2)}{B(0,1)}.
$$  

By definition, the RHS is the [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md). The LHS is the expected spot price under the martingale probabilities. So, the [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) is the expected spot price under the  

martingale probabilities. In addition, this result generalizes to bonds of any maturity, but again, it applies over the next period, not beyond that horizon.  

Finally, let us show that the equivalence of the [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) to the expected spot price does not imply equivalence of the [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) to the expected [spot rate](../../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md). The RHS of Equation (25.24) can be written as follows:  
$$
\frac{B(0,2)}{B(0,1)}=\frac{e^{-r_{c}(0,2)}}{e^{-r_{c}(0,1)}}=e^{-\left[r_{c}(0,2)-r_{c}(0,1)\right]}.
$$  

Suppose we take the log of the RHS of Equation (25.24). So we must also take the log of the LHS, but it does not reduce to $\phi r_{c}(1,2)^{+}+(1-\phi)r_{c}(1,2)^{-}$ , the expected [spot rate](../../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md). It is simply $\ln[\phi B(1,2)^{+}+(1-\phi)B(1,2)^{-}]$ . Although this value will be close to the expected [spot rate](../../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md), it is not equivalent.  

# 25.3 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LOCAL AND UNBIASED EXPECTATIONS HYPOTHESES𝟕  

In this section, we will review some of the more technical aspects of [term structure](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) math as well as demonstrate that the LEH and UEH are equivalent in discrete time with [continuously compounded interest](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Assignments/Solutions/PSET%207%20Solutions-Financial%20Instruments.md) rates. Further, we make no assumption here related to a risk-neutral framework. Our focus is on the actual probability measure. Although the LEH and UEH are not equivalent in discrete time with discretely compounded [interest rates](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md), the magnitude of the difference is indistinguishable when applied to empirical data. For our purposes, all bonds are assumed to be default free. Due to the technical nature of this discussion, we adopt more precise notation for this section.  

We denote $\boldsymbol{r}(t,t+j)$ as the continuously compounded [spot rate](../../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) observed at time $t$ and maturing at time $t+j$ , the $j$ period [spot rate](../../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md). We suppress the subscript $c$ for [continuous compounding](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) in an effort to simplify. We denote $f(t,t+j)$ as the [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) observed at time $t$ and for maturity $t+j$ , a one-period [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md). Thus, the [spot rate](../../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md) spans time $t$ to $t+j$ , whereas the [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) spans only $t+j-1$ to $t+j$ . Based on this notation, the price at time $t$ of an $n$ -period zero-coupon bond with par value of one dollar at time $t+n$ is  
$$
P(t,t+n)=e^{-[r(t,t+1)+f(t,t+1)+\ldots+f(t,t+n-1)]}.
$$  

The continuously compounded [holding period return](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Yield%20and%20Return.md) can be expressed as  
$$
H P R(t,t+1,n)=\ln{\left[\frac{P(t+1,t+n)}{P(t,t+n)}\right]}.
$$  

The UEH states that  
$$
f(t,t+j)=E_{t}[r(t+j,t+j+1)];j=1,\dots,n.
$$  

The LEH states that  
$$
E_{t}[H P R(t,t+1,j)]=r(t,t+1);j=1,\ldots,n.
$$  

Substituting Equation (25.26) into Equation (25.27), we note  
$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{\lefteqn{H P R(t,t+1,n)=r(t,t+1)+[f(t,t+1)-r(t+1,t+2)]+[f(t,t+2)-r(t+1,t+3)}}\\ &{}&{\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\cdot\dots+[f(t,t+n-1)-r(t+1,t+n)].}\\ &{}&{\quad\quad\quad\quad(25.}\end{array}
$$  

Based on the definition of continuously compounded holding period [returns](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md), the LEH can be expressed as  
$$
r(t,t+1)=E_{t}\{\ln[P(t+1,t+j)]\}-\ln[P(t,t+j)];j=2,\ldots,n.
$$  

Again, substituting for the price from Equation (25.26) and rearranging, we have  
$$
0=\sum_{i=1}^{j}\{f(t,t+i)-E_{t}[r(t+1,t+i)]\};j=2,...,n.
$$  

Thus, a new interpretation of LEH is related to current [expectations](../../../Fixed%20Income%20Asset%20Pricing/Fixed%20Income%20Lecture%20Notes/FORWARD%20RATES%20AND%20TERM%20STRUCTURE.md) of future spot rates over the next time period, $t$ to $t+1$ . Note that this is not a result of [arbitrage](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) forces leading one to a risk-neutral solution. UEH, however, addresses forecast accuracy over longer horizons. Note that if LEH holds at time $t$ for two- through $n$ -period bonds, we have  
$$
f(t,t+j)=E_{t}[r(t+j,t+j+1)];j=1,\ldots,n.
$$  

Therefore, if LEH holds for all future time periods, then UEH also holds.  

This analysis breaks down with discretely compounded [interest rates](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md). Brooks and Livingston (1992) rigorously document that the difference is quite small. Based on empirical evidence they examine, the empirical difference between UEH and LEH is typically less than a basis point when using monthly rates.  

In summary, with [continuous compounding](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md), if LEH holds for all future time periods, then UEH also holds. This is not true with discrete compounding. Thus, any empirical differences found when testing these two hypotheses relates solely to compounding issues. For completeness, we briefly review other hypotheses of the [term structure of interest rates](../../../Financial%20Engineering/6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md). Remember [interest rates](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) are at the very heart of almost all [financial analysis](../../../Advanced%20Financial%20Analysis%20and%20Valuation/BMW%20Valuation.md), hence, a thorough understanding of the different explanations of [interest rates](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md) of varying maturities is important.  

# 25.4 OTHER TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATE HYPOTHESES  

In this section, we review several [term structure](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) of interest rate hypotheses, excluding UEH and LEH because they have been covered already. We also provide several foundational research papers on which these hypotheses were created and evaluated.  

# 25.4.1 Return to Maturity Expectations Hypothesis (RMEH)  

The RMEH states that the [holding period return](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Yield%20and%20Return.md) from buying a long-term bond and holding it until maturity is equal to the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) from buying one-period bonds and  

rolling them into the next one-period bond for the same time period as the long-term bond. Based on our notation, we have  
$$
\mathrm{RMEH}\colon r(t,t+j)=\sum_{i=1}^{j}E_{t}[r(t+i-1,t+i)];j=1,\ldots,n.
$$  

See Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1981, 1985a, b). One variation of RMEH is the yield to maturity [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) (YMEH). The YMEH states that the yield to maturity from buying a long-term bond and holding it until maturity is equal to the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) from buying one-period bonds and rolling them into the next one-period bond for the same time period as the long-term bond. Note this hypothesis is just a restatement of the RMEH. See Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1981, 1985a, b).  

# 25.4.2 Term Premium Hypothesis (TPH)  

The TPH states that forward rates are biased predictors of future spot rates. Specifically, forward rates are biased by a known amount defined as a [term premium](../../../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Table%20of%20Contents.md) (tp). The [term premium](../../../Contemporary%20Financial%20Intermediation%20Notes/Table%20of%20Contents.md) might be positive or negative, might vary widely with maturity, and might vary across time. The word term is generic and might indicate a wide variety of issues depending on context. The word term, however, is always indicative of [time to maturity](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Lecture%20Notes-%20Financial%20Instruments/Teaching%20Note%201-%20Forward%20Rates%20Agreement/Hedging%20Strategies%20with%20Forwards.md). Thus, this generic TPH encapsulates all the premium hypotheses stated here. Based on our notation, we have  
$$
\mathrm{TPH:~}f(t,t+j)=E_{t}[r(t+j,t+j+1)]+t p(t,t+j);j=1,\ldots,n.
$$  

See Kane (1980). The [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) premium hypothesis (LPH) is a variation of the TPH. The LPH states that forward rates are biased predictors of future spot rates and are biased high by a known amount defined as a [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) premium $(l p)$ . The idea is that investors deem shorter maturity bonds as being more liquid; hence, they demand a higher yield for longer maturity bonds. From this perspective, the [liquidity](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%205-%20Private%20Information,%20Liquidity,%20and%20Securitization/Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Class%20Note%2010%20Liquidity%20and%20Liquidity%20Managementliquidity%20management.md) premium must be positive and must be nondecreasing with long maturities. It might vary across time. Based on our notation, we have  
$$
\mathrm{LPH:~}f(t,t+j)=E_{t}[r(t+j,t+j+1)]+l p(t,t+j);j=1,\ldots,n.
$$  

See Hicks (1946) and Kane (1980).  

# 25.4.3 Money Substitute Hypothesis (MSH)  

The MSH states that forward rates are biased predictors of future spot rates by a known amount defined as a money premium $(m p)$ . The money premium is based solely on the very short-term bonds acting as a pure substitute for money; hence, demand is high and yields and holding period [returns](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%203%20-%20%20Assets,%20Portfolios,%20and%20Arbitrage/Assets.md) are low. The money premium must be positive and must be nondecreasing with long maturities. It might vary across time. Based on our notation, we have  
$$
\mathrm{MSH:}\ \boldsymbol{f}(t,t+j)=E_{t}[r(t+j,t+j+1)]+m p(t,t+j);j=1,\ldots,n.
$$  

See Thornton (1802), Mill (1923), Keynes (1935), Timberlake (1964), and Kessel (1965).  

# 25.4.4 Segmented Markets Hypothesis (SMH)  

The SMH states that forward rates are biased predictors of future spot rates based on maturity sectors representing distinct markets with their own supply and demand forces. These forces result in known allowance amounts and are defined here as a segment premium $(s p)$ . The SMH requires knowledge of where these maturity segments are located before being able to assign the appropriate segment premiums. The segment premium might be positive or negative, might vary widely across maturities, and might vary across time. Based on our notation, we have  
$$
\mathrm{SMH}\colon f(t,t+j)=E_{t}[r(t+j,t+j+1)]+s p(t,t+j);j=1,\ldots,n.
$$  

See [Culbertson](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Liquidity%20Preference%20Market%20Segmentation%20and%20P.md) (1957) and Sundaresan (2002). Sundaresan suggests SMH driven by regulatory constraints.  

The preferred habitat hypothesis (PHH) is a variation of the MSH. The core idea is that investors have preferred maturities of bonds they trade. For example, insurance companies might prefer very long-dated bonds whereas banks prefer bonds with less than a few years to maturity. These maturity [ranges](../../Financial%20Engineering%20and%20Arbitrage%20in%20the%20Financial%20Markets/PART%20I%20RELATIVE%20VALUE%20BUILDING%20BLOCKS/Chapter%206%20Options%20on%20Non-Price%20Variables/Exotic%20Interest%20Rate%20Options.md) are their preferred habitats. For a sufficient yield differential these preferences might be overcome. The PHH states that forward rates are biased predictors of future spot rates. Specifically, forward rates are biased based on habitat displacement allowances. This known allowance amount is defined as a habitat premium $(b p)$ . The PHH requires knowledge of borrower and lender habitats before being able to assign the appropriate habitat premiums. The habitat premium might be positive or negative, might vary widely across maturities, and might vary across time. Based on our notation, we have  
$$
\mathrm{PHH:}~f(t,t+j)=E_{t}[r(t+j,t+j+1)]+b p(t,t+j);j=1,\ldots,n.

See [Modigliani](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Liquidity%20Preference%20Market%20Segmentation%20and%20P.md) and Sutch (1966). Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1981) suggest LPH is a special case of PHH where the preferred habitat is short-term bonds.  

# 25.4.5 Risk Premium Hypothesis (RPH)  

The RPH states that forward rates are biased predictors of future spot rates based on the [market price of risk](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) bearing and the systematic risk of each bond. Every bond, except the single-period bond, contains some systematic risk and its [market price of risk](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md) might vary. This known compensation for risk is defined as a risk premium $(r p)$ . The RPH requires the ability to measure systematic risk as well as knowledge of the [market price of risk](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2012%20-%20Derivatives/Exercises.md)-bearing services for various amounts of systematic risk before being able to assign the appropriate risk premiums. The risk premium must be positive, might vary widely across maturities, and might vary across time. Based on our notation, we have  
$$
\mathrm{PH:}\ {f(t,t+j)}=E_{t}[r(t+j,t+j)+1]+r\phi(t,t+j);j=1,\ldots,n.
$$  

See [Modigliani](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/Liquidity%20Preference%20Market%20Segmentation%20and%20P.md) and Sutch (1966).  

# 25.5 RECAP AND PREVIEW  

In this chapter, we introduced the local [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) and distinguished it from the well-known and widely covered unbiased [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md). The latter states that the [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) in the [term structure](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) represents the expected future [spot rate](../../../International%20Finance/The%20Foreign%20Exchange%20Market%20Annotations.md). The local [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) says something similar, but not precisely the same. It says that when the [term structure](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) is [arbitrage](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) free, the [forward rate](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) is the [expected return](../../../Advanced%20Investments/Lecture%201-%20Probability%20Distributions%20of%20Returns.md) from any strategy over the shortest holding period, and this rate is the shortest period [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md).  

We further explored when the unbiased [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) and local [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) are different and when they are the same. Further, we briefly reviewed numerous other [term structure](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) theories that have been offered over the years.  

In Chapter 26, we introduce interest rate [derivatives](../../Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md), specifically FRAs, swaps, and interest rate options.  

# QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS  

1 In some countries, it is illegal to provide financing for [arbitrage](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) activities. Explain how the [introduction](../../../Financial%20Markets%20and%20Institutions/III.%20Liquidity%20of%20Assets/Class%209-%20Bailouts%20and%20Bank%20Failures/Squam%20Lake%20Group%20Introduction.md) of legal [arbitrage](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%207/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20of%20Derivatives.md) activities would be expected to change forward prices. Assume that the hedgers and speculators are roughly balanced between buyers and sellers.   
2 Explain the concept of a [certainty equivalent](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%205%20-%20Modeling%20the%20Preferences%20of%20Individuals/Risk%20Aversion.md) and how it is applied in [forward pricing](../../../Financial%20Engineering/Derivatives/Part%20I%20-%20Forwards%20and%20Futures/Chapter%203%20-%20Forward%20and%20Futures%20Prices.md) models.   
3 Compare and contrast the unbiased [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) and the local [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) within the context of [interest rates](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%202/Interest%20Rate%20Quotations.md).   
4 Under what conditions are the unbiased [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) and the local [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) identical?   
5 Other than the unbiased [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) and the local [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md), identify and define three other hypotheses related to the [term structure of interest rates](../../../Financial%20Engineering/6.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Stochastic%20Calculus.md).  

# NOTES  

1. We use rates and yields interchangeably as often occurs within the literature. Where necessary, we will distinguish between specific measures, such as yield to maturity and [holding period return](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%203/Yield%20and%20Return.md).   
2. An excellent illustration of the US government bond [term structure](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%209/The%20Vasicek%20Model.md) and how it has evolved over time is at https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/yieldcurve.php.   
3. The unbiased [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) is sometimes called the [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md), but this is a tremendous misnomer that will become apparent in this chapter, whereby we cover another [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md), the local [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md). The unbiased [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md) is also sometimes called the pure [expectations hypothesis](../../Financial%20Asset%20Pricing%20Theory%20Overview/Chapter%2010%20-%20The%20Economics%20of%20the%20Term%20Structure%20of%20Interest%20Rates/The%20Expectation%20Hypothesis.md), although it is unclear what is so pure about it.   
4. For references with more details on this subject, see Longstaff (2000), Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1981), and Chance and Rich (2001).  

5. For ease of exposition, we simplify the [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) from $F_{0}(T)$ to simply $F_{0}$ .  

6. If there were any costs of holding the asset, these costs would be added. If the asset paid out any cash, these amounts would be deducted. It is easy to prove Equation (25.5). Assume that an investor buys the asset and sells a [forward contract](../../../Clippings/Forward%20Points%20in%20Currency.md) at the price $F_{0}$ , which obligates the investor to deliver the asset at time 1 and receive $F_{0}$ . This transaction is risk free, because it guarantees a return per dollar invested of $F_{0}/S_{0}$ . Being risk free, this return must equal the [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md). Or, as Equation (25.5) is stated, the spot price must compound to the [forward price](../../Fixed%20Income%20Securities%20Tools%20for%20Today's%20Markets/Chapter%2011/Forward%20Contracts%20and%20Forward%20Prices.md) at the [risk-free rate](../../../Financial%20Instruments/Black%20Scholes%20Derivation.md).
