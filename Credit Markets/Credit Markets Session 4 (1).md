## US Treasury Yields as of 2023-05-05

## Motivation for "Smooth" US Treasury Curve

<<<<<<< HEAD
Observation: ~380 US cash treasury instruments (bills, notes and bonds) actively traded in the market, quoted at different prices/yields, based on coupon, maturity and liquidity profile (~380 dimensional problem)

Question: can we compute model prices for all US Treasuries using one sparse parametric model (dimensionality reduction)?

>>>>>>> d83d5c06204d625fbecfdb77e4d3f37c9c80e27b

Main idea: find a "smooth"/parametric spot/zero rates curve that best fits the market

## The Nelson-Siegel Model for Smooth Yield Curves

The Nelson-Siegel '87 Model

Idea: decompose the spot/zero yield curve $y(T)$ into 3 "basis function shapes":

Level: $$\theta_{1} \cdot 1$$

Slope: $$\theta_{2} \cdot \frac{1-e^{-T/\lambda}}{T/\lambda}$$

Curvature/"hump": $$\theta_{3} \cdot \left(\frac{1-e^{-T/\lambda}}{T/\lambda}-e^{-T/\lambda}\right)$$

- ... and calibrate/control the yield curve shape via
	- "basis loadings" $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, $\theta_3$ parameters and
	- "curve location" $\lambda$ parameter
- Svensson '94 extension
	- added "second hump" shape: $\theta_4 \cdot \left(\frac{1-e^{-T/\lambda_{2}}}{T/\lambda_{2}}-e^{-T/\lambda_{2}}\right)$

## Recap: Pricing Risky Instruments (Cash Bonds and CDS)

- For a given issuer and seniority rank, prices for all risky instruments (with known specs) can be computed from
- ... the discount factor curve $DF(0, T), T ≥ t ≥ 0$, calibrated to risk-free rates market (TSY & SOFR) and
- ... the hazard rate curve $h(t, T), T ≥ t ≥ 0$.
- Very useful to think of "average" hazard rates $H(t, T)$

- ... the Credit Markets Session 3 | discount factor curve]] $DF(0, T), T ≥ t ≥ 0$, calibrated to risk-free rates market (TSY & SOFR) and

- Very useful to think of "average" RISK NEUTRAL VALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS | hazard rates]] $H(t, T)$
>>>>>>> d83d5c06204d625fbecfdb77e4d3f37c9c80e27b
$$H(t, T)=\frac{1}{T-t}\int_{t}^{T}h(t, s)ds\tag{1}$$
$$SP(t, T)=\exp\left[(t-T)\cdot H(t, T)\right]\tag{2}$$

## Implementing a "Smooth" Credit Risk Model

Main idea: use parametric form for average hazard rate curve as of time $t$
$$H(t, T)=H(t, T | \theta_{t})\tag{3}$$
<<<<<<< HEAD

Parameter vector $\theta_{t}$ controls the "shape" (level, slope, convexity, etc) of the credit curve.

The implied parametric form for the survival probability curve is given by
$$\mathcal{S}P(t, T)=\mathcal{S}P(t, T | \theta_{t})=\exp\left[(t-T)\cdot H(t, T | \theta_{t})\right]\tag{4}$$

$\theta_1 = 3\%$, $\theta_2 = -1\%$, $\theta_3 = -0.1\%$, $\lambda = 5$

## Implementation/Calibration of Smooth Credit Risk Model
- For a given issuer and seniority rank, collect market prices for all bonds and CDS at time $t$.
- For each instrument, determine calibration weights based on liquidity and riskiness, e.g. $w_i = \frac{LiqScore_i}{DV01_i}$
- Model calibration consists of minimizing the SSE ("Sum of Squared Errors") between model and market prices:
$$SSE(t, \theta):=\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_{i}\cdot\left | MarketPrice_{t}^{i}-ModelPrice_{t}^{i}(\theta)\right | ^{2} \tag{5}$$
$$\theta_{t}^{*}=\underset{\theta}{\text{argmin}}\left\{SSE(t, \theta)\right\} \tag{6}$$

## Assessing Model Calibration Results

- Differences between model and market prices are called "model edges"
- "Model edges" can be converted from price into yield or spread space, by using DV01/sensitivities
- Can we think of the calibrated model prices as "fair prices" for the given instruments, at least on a relative basis?

## From Model Edges to Trading Strategies
- Assuming we do have the "fair price" of securities
<<<<<<< HEAD
	- can we construct a portfolio strategy (e.g. pairs trading) of "edge dislocated" instruments with an "above average" strategy PnL?
- Is this a "pure arbitrage" or a "statistical arbitrage" strategy?
- Is the strategy executable: liquidity, transaction costs, capacity, cost of financing, etc?
- Can we validate via strategy simulation/backtesting?

### Quant Trading

## "Fair" Prices, Market Prices and Edges

- Use quant models to estimate "fair" value of securities
- "Edge"/"alpha" = temporary dislocations between fair and market prices
- Alpha raw metrics: current edge dislocation, estimated edge volatility
- Alpha convergence metrics: stationarity, mean-reversion speed and signal half-life

## Risk Models
- Joint securities dynamics decomposed into
	- Factors risks
	- Idiosyncratic risks
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Portfolio factor risks aggregated at portfolio level via "betas"/factor loadings
- Knowledge of factor Co-Variance matrix & individual "idio" vols enables risk predictions on portfolio level

### Risk Model: Examples

- Interest Rates: DV01, IR01
- Credit Default: CS01, Gamma, Jump-To-Default
- Liquidity

#### Cross-Sectional Regression Models

#### Statistical Risk Factors
- PCA factor models

## Portfolio Construction: Ingredients
- Alpha signals
	- multiple edges can be "mixed" into aggregated edge
- Risk model(s)
- Transaction costs model
- Portfolio constraints (notional and risk limits)
- Numerical optimizer (linear-quadratic/convex optimization)

## Expected Utility Optimization Formula
- Maximize total alpha capture,
- Penalize risk/variance and "re-balancing volume"
- ... while taking into account position and risk constraints
- ... and transaction costs

## Strategy Backtesting
- For a given set of model parameters, implement a simulator/backtester of the strategy Positions/PnL/Volume metrics on historical data
- Run the strategy backtests on a (multi-dimensional) grid of the model parameter space
- Analyze the results and decide the optimal model parameters, to be used in "production" trading
- Adjust the production/optimal model parameters based on LIVE trading feedback, in order to maximize the strategy performance
