The U.S. dollar has seen some remarkable swings against major currencies recently. For example,  over most of 2005,  it gained nearly 18% against the yen and 13% against the euro,  while between March and May 2006,  it depreciated sharply against these currencies,  losing almost 10% of its value. Many observers have related these swings to what is known as the [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]]. This is a strategy widely used by investors in [[Lecture Notes on International Finance|international financial]] markets that is based on exploiting the existence of [[What Really Is the Cross-Currency Basis|interest rate differentials]] across countries.

The use of this strategy by investors is puzzling,  as the theory of [[Covered and Uncovered Interest Parity|interest parity]] conditions implies that it should not generate predictable profits. This _Economic Letter_ explores this puzzle by first describing the structure of a [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]] transaction. It then reviews research documenting the payoff properties of carry trades and discusses how these strategies can be linked to the swings in exchange rates observed over recent years. Finally,  it presents some evidence on the size of [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]] strategies.

**What is the [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]]?**

In the most common version of this strategy,  an investor borrows a given amount in a low-interest-rate [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] (the “funding” [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]),  converts the funds into a high-interest-rate [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] (the “target” [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]) and lends the resulting amount in the target [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] at the higher interest rate.

Another version exploits the forward premium of one [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] relative to another. The forward premium is basically the percent difference between the [[A Primer on Currency Derivatives|forward exchange rate]] and the [[Arbitrage Opportunity Accounting|spot exchange rate]] between two currencies. Specifically,  the [[A Primer on Currency Derivatives|forward exchange rate]] between two currencies indicates the amount of one [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to be delivered at a specific future date that can be bought with a single unit of the other [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  while the [[Arbitrage Opportunity Accounting|spot exchange rate]] refers to immediate delivery. This version combines two transactions. The first involves selling currencies that are at a forward premium,  that is,  currencies for which the [[A Primer on Currency Derivatives|forward exchange rate]] is higher than the [[Arbitrage Opportunity Accounting|spot exchange rate]]. The second involves buying currencies that are at a forward discount,  that is,  currencies for which the [[A Primer on Currency Derivatives|forward exchange rate]] is lower than the [[Arbitrage Opportunity Accounting|spot exchange rate]]. Thus,  currencies that are at a forward premium are like funding currencies and those that are at a forward discount are like target currencies.

Why is this version equivalent to the one based on [[What Really Is the Cross-Currency Basis|interest rate differentials]]? According to an equilibrium condition of [[Lecture Notes on International Finance|international financial]] markets,  called “[[Interest Rates, Carry Trades, and Exchange Rate Movements|covered interest parity]], ” the forward premium of one [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] relative to another is equal to the interest rate differential between them. Traders in [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) markets,  in fact,  use this condition to set forward exchange rates and,  thereby,  forward premiums. This implies that currencies with a low interest rate are typically at a forward premium,  whereas currencies with a high interest rate are typically at a forward discount. Therefore,  borrowing in currencies with [[The Economist Time Is Cheap|low interest rates]] and lending in currencies with high [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] is equivalent to selling currencies that are at a forward premium and buying currencies that are at a forward discount.

**Not profitable in theory,  but profitable in practice**

According to economic theory,  an [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] strategy based on exploiting differences in [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] across countries should yield no predictable profits. Consider two countries,  one with a high interest rate,  and the other with a low interest rate. According to another equilibrium condition of [[Lecture Notes on International Finance|international financial]] markets called the “uncovered [[Covered and Uncovered Interest Parity|interest parity]], ” the difference in [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] between the two countries simply reflects the rate at which investors expect the high-interest-rate [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to depreciate against the low-interest-rate [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]. When this depreciation occurs,  investors who borrowed a given amount in the low-interest-rate [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] and then lent it in the high-interest-rate [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] will find that their return is worth less. The uncovered [[Covered and Uncovered Interest Parity|interest parity]] condition implies,  indeed,  that investors should expect to receive no profits,  as they should expect the return from lending in the high-interest-rate [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] to be worth ultimately as much as the cost of borrowing in the low-interest-rate [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]].

In practice,  however,  investors in [[Lecture Notes on International Finance|international financial]] markets do seem able to make profits through such strategies. In fact,  market participants and commentators have often cited the [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]] as the source of several recent [[Interest Rates, Carry Trades, and Exchange Rate Movements|exchange rate swings]].

Why can carry trades be profitable? If the exchange rate between the funding and the target currencies does not move,  then the profit from the [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]] is proportional to both the interest rate differential and the forward premium between the two currencies. But,  of course,  exchange rates do move,  and,  therefore,  a [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]] involves [[PSET 3 Financial Instruments|exchange rate risk]],  in particular,  the possibility that the target [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] will depreciate against the [[Interest Rates, Carry Trades, and Exchange Rate Movements|funding currency]]. In that case,  the value of the amount initially borrowed in the [[Interest Rates, Carry Trades, and Exchange Rate Movements|funding currency]] will increase in terms of the target [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]],  effectively increasing the borrowing cost of the strategy. By the same token,  the higher interest rate obtained by lending in the target [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] will be worth less in terms of the [[Interest Rates, Carry Trades, and Exchange Rate Movements|funding currency]],  ultimately trimming its profitability.

If the [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]] is a risky strategy,  why are investors reported to use it extensively? The answer lies in the “forward premium puzzle.” This is a well-known empirical anomaly of [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) markets,  and it concerns the implications of the forward premium for the realized rate of change in the value of one [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] relative to another. Empirical evidence shows that currencies that are at a forward premium and that,  correspondingly,  have a low interest rate,  actually tend,  on average,  to _depreciate_,  not appreciate,  as the theory of [[Covered and Uncovered Interest Parity|interest parity]] conditions predicts. Similarly,  currencies that are at a forward discount and that,  correspondingly,  have a high interest rate,  tend,  on average,  to _appreciate_,  not depreciate. This anomaly,  then,  implies that an investor who enters a [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]] is quite likely to make predictable profits from two sources: the interest rate differential between two currencies and the appreciation of the high-interest-rate [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] that was originally bought at a forward discount.

**[[Currency Carry Trade|Carry trade]] profits and [[Interest Rates, Carry Trades, and Exchange Rate Movements|exchange rate swings]]**

How large are the profits from [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]] strategies? Work by Burnside et al. (2006) provides one answer to this question. These authors document the return properties of a version of the [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]] that they call an “optimally weighted” [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]] [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]]. Like the earlier example,  it involves selling currencies that are at a forward premium and buying currencies that are at a forward discount. It also entails choosing the weights of the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] in order to maximize its Sharpe ratio,  which evaluates the risk-adjusted performance of a [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] by correcting a measure of its average return with the volatility of its [[Assets|returns]]. Burnside et al. find that,  for the period from 1977 to 2005,  the realized cumulative return to their strategy is very similar to that of investing in the S&P500 index. The relative attractiveness of their strategy,  however,  lies in the lower volatility of its [[Assets|returns]]: the Sharpe ratio of their strategy is about one and a half times larger than the Sharpe ratio of the S&P500 index,  implying that the volatility of the [[Assets|returns]] of their [[Interest Rates, Carry Trades, and Exchange Rate Movements|carry trade strategy]] is only two-thirds of the volatility of the [[Assets|returns]] of the S&P500 index.

Even though the Sharpe ratio of the optimally weighted [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]] [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] is relatively high,  transaction costs,  such as [[Class Note 9 [[Class Note 9 Bid and Ask Prices With Private Information|Bid and Ask]] Prices With Private Information|[[Bid-Ask Prices with Adverse SelectionPrivate Information|bid-ask]] spreads]],  lower its average payoff significantly,  as they are of the same order of magnitude as the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] [[Assets|returns]]. This implies that,  in order to generate substantial profits,  investors need to roll over the [[Interest Rates, Carry Trades, and Exchange Rate Movements|carry trade strategy]] for prolonged periods.

Changes in supply and demand for currencies prompted by the opportunity to exploit [[What Really Is the Cross-Currency Basis|interest rate differentials]] can,  therefore,  result in sizeable and persistent exchange rate movements. Specifically,  carry trades based on [[What Really Is the Cross-Currency Basis|interest rate differentials]] and forward premiums affect the balance of supply and demand for funding and target currencies in [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) markets. In particular,  as these strategies involve selling short funding currencies and,  at the same time,  buying target currencies,  they induce excess supply of the funding currencies and excess demand for target currencies. In turn,  this leads to the depreciation of low-interest-rate funding currencies and to the appreciation of highinterest-rate target currencies. In addition,  the appreciation of high-interest-rate target currencies can encourage an increasing number of investors to enter this strategy and,  ultimately,  amplify the appreciation of target currencies,  as well as the persistence of exchange rate movements of the currencies involved in these strategies.

The appreciation of the dollar against the yen and the euro that occurred over most of 2005,  for example,  has been related to increasing [[What Really Is the Cross-Currency Basis|interest rate differentials]]. As [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] rose in the U.S. while remaining at near-zero levels in Japan and at 2% in the euro area,  the dollar looked like an increasingly attractive target [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]]. In contrast,  in early 2006,  the decline in the dollar has been related to [[FORWARD RATES AND TERM STRUCTURE|expectations]] of narrowing [[What Really Is the Cross-Currency Basis|interest rate differentials]]: As investors started to expect rising [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] in Japan and the euro area,  the attractiveness of using the dollar as a target [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] decreased.

**How big is the [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]]?**

The effect of carry trades on exchange rates most likely depends on the magnitude of the [[Lecture Notes on International Finance|international financial]] transactions and [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] positions associated with them. Unfortunately,  evidence on these magnitudes is fairly limited,  in part because these strategies are generally conducted through transactions,  such as [[[[A Practical Guide for Actuaries and other Business Professionals.|Financial Instruments]]/Review Session Notes/[[Financial Instruments PSET Solutions|Currency Swaps]].md|[[Financial Instruments PSET Solutions|currency swaps]]]],  that are reported as off-balance-sheet items and,  therefore,  hard to monitor through official statistics.

Two studies from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS),  however,  provide some evidence of the size of [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]] activity and thereby their significance in exchange rate movements. One study concerns [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) market turnover,  which measures the gross value in U.S. dollar equivalents of all transactions involving the exchange of two currencies. Galati and Melvin (2004) argue that the remarkable increase in [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) market turnover between 2001 and 2004 was likely due to a rise in [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]] activities. They note that the increase in turnover was particularly strong for the Australian and the New Zealand dollars,  two currencies with relatively high [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] that simultaneously had extended periods of appreciation against low-interest-rate currencies,  such as the U.S. dollar and the yen. The authors also illustrated graphically that,  between 2001 and 2004,  as the interest rate differential with the U.S. widened,  the Australian dollar appreciated against the U.S. dollar and [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) turnover increased substantially. Finally,  based on survey data from 1992 to 2004,  they found that,  for major trading currencies,  increases in [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) market turnover were strongly related to [[What Really Is the Cross-Currency Basis|interest rate differentials]] with the U.S.

The second study concerns the stock of outstanding BIS reporting banks’ cross-border claims denominated in yen,  a [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] that has been popular as a [[Interest Rates, Carry Trades, and Exchange Rate Movements|funding currency]],  given the long period of very [[The Economist Time Is Cheap|low interest rates]] in Japan. McGuire and Tarashev (2006) report that the stock of yen-denominated claims rose substantially in the fourth quarter of 2005,  continuing a trend evident since 2004. They argue that this provides some evidence of the increased relevance of yen [[Currency Carry Trade|carry trade]] positions,  as a large share of the increase in yen-denominated claims has been driven by the increase in yen borrowing by investors in financial centers.

**Conclusions**

Market participants and commentators have often linked the swings in exchange rates over recent years to the use of carry trades,  that is,  investors’ strategies that exploit [[What Really Is the Cross-Currency Basis|interest rate differentials]] across countries. What is puzzling from a theoretical standpoint,  however,  is that investors should even engage in carry trades,  because the textbook theory of [[Covered and Uncovered Interest Parity|interest parity]] conditions implies that these strategies should yield no predictable profits. As this _Economic Letter_ has explained,  the key to the puzzle is yet another puzzle—the forward premium puzzle—wherein currencies with high or rising [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] tend to appreciate,  and currencies with low or declining [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]] tend to depreciate,  as investors are lured into buying currencies with positive [[What Really Is the Cross-Currency Basis|interest rate differentials]] and selling short currencies with negative [[What Really Is the Cross-Currency Basis|interest rate differentials]]. The evidence on the quantitative importance of carry trades is fairly limited,  but to date it suggests that these strategies may well have been an important factor in recent [[Interest Rates, Carry Trades, and Exchange Rate Movements|exchange rate swings]].
