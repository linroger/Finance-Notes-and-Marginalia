## WHAT IS A CARRY TRADE?

A Interest Rates,  Carry Trades,  and Exchange Rate Movements](Asset%20Classes/Derivatives/Forward%20and%20Futures/Forward%20Exchange%20Rate%20Contracts/Foreign%20Exchange%20Notes/Interest%20Rates,  %20Carry%20Trades,  %20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) is a form of arbitrage that takes advantage of price discrepancies between futures and spot prices. When performing a Interest Rates,  Carry Trades,  and Exchange Rate Movements](Asset%20Classes/Derivatives/Forward%20and%20Futures/Forward%20Exchange%20Rate%20Contracts/Foreign%20Exchange%20Notes/Interest%20Rates,  %20Carry%20Trades,  %20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md),  the trader will take a position in the spot market and simultaneously take the opposite position in the futures market. Since one leg makes money as the other loses money,  the strategy is referred to as “market neutral.” When trading a market-neutral strategy,  the trader doesn’t care which direction the underlying asset’s price moves. 

The strategy’s profitability relies on the fact that futures contracts are often priced above or below the spot price. A futures contract’s price represents a market’s perception of where its underlying asset is heading by its settlement date. Therefore,  futures prices often drift from the current spot price,  presenting an opportunity to profit with relatively little risk. 

When the spot price is below the futures price,  the market is said to be in _contango_,  and a Interest Rates,  Carry Trades,  and Exchange Rate Movements](Asset%20Classes/Derivatives/Forward%20and%20Futures/Forward%20Exchange%20Rate%20Contracts/Foreign%20Exchange%20Notes/Interest%20Rates,  %20Carry%20Trades,  %20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) will often result in profits. When the opposite is true,  the market is said to be in _backwardation_,  and a reverse Interest Rates,  Carry Trades,  and Exchange Rate Movements](Asset%20Classes/Derivatives/Forward%20and%20Futures/Forward%20Exchange%20Rate%20Contracts/Foreign%20Exchange%20Notes/Interest%20Rates,  %20Carry%20Trades,  %20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) (i.e.,  shorting in the spot market and longing the futures contract) will be a more favorable strategy. 

When performing a Interest Rates,  Carry Trades,  and Exchange Rate Movements](Asset%20Classes/Derivatives/Forward%20and%20Futures/Forward%20Exchange%20Rate%20Contracts/Foreign%20Exchange%20Notes/Interest%20Rates,  %20Carry%20Trades,  %20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md),  a trader will look for as wide a spread as possible between the spot price and futures price. As settlement approaches,  this spread will naturally narrow because the time in which the spot price can increase or decrease reduces. By settlement,  the two prices will have converged. The trader can close both positions for a profit whenever the spread is narrower than it was at entry. 

Alternatively,  a trader who settles the futures leg of a Interest Rates,  Carry Trades,  and Exchange Rate Movements](Asset%20Classes/Derivatives/Forward%20and%20Futures/Forward%20Exchange%20Rate%20Contracts/Foreign%20Exchange%20Notes/Interest%20Rates,  %20Carry%20Trades,  %20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) can opt to “roll over” their trade to a later-dated futures contract. If there is a wide spread between the spot price and a longer-term contract when closing the first futures position,  simply shorting the further out contract and continuing to hold the spot position will create a new Interest Rates,  Carry Trades,  and Exchange Rate Movements](Asset%20Classes/Derivatives/Forward%20and%20Futures/Forward%20Exchange%20Rate%20Contracts/Foreign%20Exchange%20Notes/Interest%20Rates,  %20Carry%20Trades,  %20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) with a new settlement date.

#### REVERSE CASH-AND-CARRY ARBITRAGE

A reverse cash-and-carry arbitrage is the exact opposite to a cash-and –carry transaction. Instead of buying the underlying security because it is underpriced,  you sell it short (because it is overpriced),  take the proceeds and go long a futures position on the underlying security. Before the futures position expires you close out the position by taking delivery and returning the borrowed shares you were short.
