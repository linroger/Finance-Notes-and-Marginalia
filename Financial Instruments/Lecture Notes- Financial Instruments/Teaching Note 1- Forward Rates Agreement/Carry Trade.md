## WHAT IS A CARRY TRADE?

A [[[Interest Rate Quotations|Interest Rates]],  Carry Trades,  and Exchange Rate Movements](Asset%20Classes/[[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|Derivatives]]/Forward%20and%20Futures/Forward%20Exchange%20Rate%20Contracts/Foreign%20Exchange%20Notes/Interest%20Rates,  %20Carry%20Trades,  %20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) is a form of [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]] that takes advantage of price discrepancies between [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] and [[Contango And Backwardation In Arbitrage-Free Futures-Markets|spot prices]]. When performing a [[[Interest Rate Quotations|Interest Rates]],  Carry Trades,  and Exchange Rate Movements](Asset%20Classes/[[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|Derivatives]]/Forward%20and%20Futures/Forward%20Exchange%20Rate%20Contracts/Foreign%20Exchange%20Notes/Interest%20Rates,  %20Carry%20Trades,  %20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md),  the trader will take a position in the spot market and simultaneously take the opposite position in the [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] market. Since one leg makes money as the other loses money,  the strategy is referred to as “market neutral.” When trading a market-neutral strategy,  the trader doesn’t care which direction the [[Risk Neutral Pricing of Options|underlying asset]]’s price moves. 

The strategy’s profitability relies on the fact that [[Mathematics of the Financial Markets|futures contracts]] are often priced above or below the spot price. A [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] contract’s price represents a market’s perception of where its [[Risk Neutral Pricing of Options|underlying asset]] is heading by its settlement date. Therefore,  [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] prices often drift from the current spot price,  presenting an opportunity to profit with relatively little risk. 

When the spot price is below the [[Futures Price and the Quality Option Before E|futures price]],  the market is said to be in _contango_,  and a [[[Interest Rate Quotations|Interest Rates]],  Carry Trades,  and Exchange Rate Movements](Asset%20Classes/[[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|Derivatives]]/Forward%20and%20Futures/Forward%20Exchange%20Rate%20Contracts/Foreign%20Exchange%20Notes/Interest%20Rates,  %20Carry%20Trades,  %20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) will often result in profits. When the opposite is true,  the market is said to be in _backwardation_,  and a reverse [[[Interest Rate Quotations|Interest Rates]],  Carry Trades,  and Exchange Rate Movements](Asset%20Classes/[[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|Derivatives]]/Forward%20and%20Futures/Forward%20Exchange%20Rate%20Contracts/Foreign%20Exchange%20Notes/Interest%20Rates,  %20Carry%20Trades,  %20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) (i.e.,  [[Short Selling|shorting]] in the spot market and longing the [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] contract) will be a more favorable strategy. 

When performing a [[[Interest Rate Quotations|Interest Rates]],  Carry Trades,  and Exchange Rate Movements](Asset%20Classes/[[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|Derivatives]]/Forward%20and%20Futures/Forward%20Exchange%20Rate%20Contracts/Foreign%20Exchange%20Notes/Interest%20Rates,  %20Carry%20Trades,  %20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md),  a trader will look for as wide a spread as possible between the spot price and [[Futures Price and the Quality Option Before E|futures price]]. As settlement approaches,  this spread will naturally narrow because the time in which the spot price can increase or decrease reduces. By settlement,  the two prices will have converged. The trader can close both positions for a profit whenever the spread is narrower than it was at entry. 

Alternatively,  a trader who settles the [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] leg of a [[[Interest Rate Quotations|Interest Rates]],  Carry Trades,  and Exchange Rate Movements](Asset%20Classes/[[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|Derivatives]]/Forward%20and%20Futures/Forward%20Exchange%20Rate%20Contracts/Foreign%20Exchange%20Notes/Interest%20Rates,  %20Carry%20Trades,  %20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) can opt to “roll over” their trade to a later-dated [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] contract. If there is a wide spread between the spot price and a longer-term contract when closing the first [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] position,  simply [[Short Selling|shorting]] the further out contract and continuing to hold the spot position will create a new [[[Interest Rate Quotations|Interest Rates]],  Carry Trades,  and Exchange Rate Movements](Asset%20Classes/[[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|Derivatives]]/Forward%20and%20Futures/Forward%20Exchange%20Rate%20Contracts/Foreign%20Exchange%20Notes/Interest%20Rates,  %20Carry%20Trades,  %20and%20Exchange%20Rate%20Movements.md) with a new settlement date.

#### REVERSE CASH-AND-CARRY ARBITRAGE

A reverse [[Dollar Rolls|cash-and-carry arbitrage]] is the exact opposite to a cash-and –carry transaction. Instead of buying the underlying security because it is underpriced,  you sell it short (because it is overpriced),  take the proceeds and go long a [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] position on the underlying security. Before the [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] position expires you close out the position by taking delivery and returning the borrowed shares you were short.

# Carry Trade

## MONTRÉAL EXCHANGE: CASH-AND-CARRY TRADE

A bond trader notes that the price relationship between the CTD Can 2% December 1,  2051 bond and the LGB contract is out-of-line.

The trader’s observation is supported by:

1. An actual repo rate (0.20%) that is lower than the repo rate (1.85%) implied by the price of the LGB contract—a condition that provides a trader an [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]] profit by initiating a [[Carry Trade|cash-and-carry]] trade (whereby the trader sells bond [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] and finances the purchase of the cash bond at a rate below the rate implied by the [[Futures Price and the Quality Option Before E|futures price]]). The bond is then held until it is delivered to fulfill the obligation of the sale of the [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] contract; and
1. A net basis (basis after carry) reflecting that the actual LGB contract is overpriced relative to its theoretical fair value.

The trader initiates a [[Carry Trade|cash-and-carry]] trade that involves the following steps:

1. Pay for the purchase of the CTD bond (bond price + [[Intra-Year Compounding and Day-Count|accrued interest]]).
1. Finance the bond purchase at the current [[Asset Backed Commercial Paper Understanding the Risks|short-term financing]] rate (actual repo rate).
1. Receive any intervening coupon plus reinvestment income during the life of the [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] contract.
1. Receive the [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|futures]] [[Accrued Interest|invoice price]] + intervening coupon [[Intra-Year Compounding and Day-Count|accrued interest]] from delivering the bond (i.e.,  collect the anticipated receipt from delivering bond to the buyer).
1. Repay the cash amount borrowed to purchase the CTD bond + interest.
1. Calculate [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|arbitrage]] profit.

### CASH-AND-CARRY TRANSACTION AMOUNT

(per$100,  000.00 notional amount)

- **Purchase the CTD bond:**$98,    964 +$932 =$99,  896 (Price of bond + [[Intra-Year Compounding and Day-Count|Accrued interest]])
- **Financing costs until LGB delivery:**$99,    896 x 0.0020 x 133/365 =$73 (Amount borrowed to buy bond × [[Asset Backed Commercial Paper Understanding the Risks|Short-term financing]] rate × Number of days/365)
- **Income during the life of the LGB contract:**$1,    000 + ($1,  000 x 0.0020 x 120/365) = C$1,  001 ([[Pl Attribution|Coupon income]] + ([[Pl Attribution|Coupon income]] × [[Asset Backed Commercial Paper Understanding the Risks|Short-term financing]] rate × Number of days/365))
- **Total costs of the bond position:**$99,    896 +$73 -$1,    001 = C$98,  968 ([[An Asset Allocation Primer|Investment]] + Financing - Income)

### DELIVERY PRICE OF THE DELIVERABLE BOND AT LGB FUTURES DELIVERY

($220,    720 x 0.4481) +$658* =$99,    563 (*$100,  000 x 2% coupon x 30/365)

- [[Futures Not Subject to Cash-And-Carry|Futures]] [[Accrued Interest|invoice price]] × Conversion factor + [[Intra-Year Compounding and Day-Count|Accrued interest]] received by the seller from the bond buyer

### ARBITRAGE PROFIT (PER LGB FUTURES)
$99,    563 -$98,  968 =$595 (Delivery price of the deliverable bond - Total costs of the bond position)

In the present strategy the [[Carry Trade|cash-and-carry]] transaction results in a profit of$595 per contract.
