# Lecture Notes 9A - Credit Default Swaps

**Instructor**: John Heaton  
**Institution**: The University of Chicago Booth School of Business

## Table of Contents

1. Types of CDS
2. Market Quantities and Size
3. CDS Market Structure
4. Sovereign Crises
5. CDS Indexes

## Types of Credit Default Swaps

### Single-Name CDS

A **Single-Name CDS** references a single entity, which can be:
- A corporation
- A sovereign entity
- A financial institution

The protection buyer pays premiums based on the credit quality of the specific reference entity.

### Multi-Name CDS

A **Multi-Name CDS** covers defaults across a reference portfolio, including:

1. **Basic Credit Default Swap Portfolios**: Structured baskets of reference entities
2. **CDS Indexes**: Typically indices composed of commonly negotiated single-name CDS contracts

**Key Features**:
- Portfolio approach to credit risk
- Diversification across multiple reference entities
- Standardized contract terms

## Market Quantities and Size

### Global Market Size (BIS 2021)

- **Total Notional**: $8.5 trillion at end of 2020
- **Market Share**: 1.5% of total global derivatives notional
- **Impact of GFC**: The 2008 Global Financial Crisis likely reduced market size, effects visible today

### Central Clearing

- **62%** of CDS contracts now cleared through central counterparties (CCPs)
- CCPs function similarly to exchanges, reducing counterparty risk
- Mandatory clearing requirements implemented post-GFC

### Sovereign CDS Growth

**Historical Context**:
- 2007: 4% of total CDS notional
- 2020: 14% of total CDS notional

This significant increase reflects:
- Growing concerns about sovereign credit risk
- Increased use of sovereign CDS for hedging and speculation
- European sovereign debt crisis impact

## CDS Market Structure

### Key Market Participants

Based on Bomfim (2022) and Bank for International Settlements (2021) data:

- **Dealers**: Primary market makers providing liquidity
- **End Users**: Non-dealer entities including:
  - Asset managers
  - Insurance companies
  - Corporate entities
  - Hedge funds
- **Central Counterparties**: Clearing houses providing risk mitigation

### Market Structure Evolution

The CDS market has evolved significantly since inception:
- Increased standardization of contract terms
- Migration to electronic trading platforms
- Enhanced regulatory oversight
- Improved transparency and reporting

## Sovereign Crises and CDS Behavior

### Case Study: Italy

CDS spreads on Italian sovereign debt demonstrate:
- Sensitivity to political and economic developments
- Market perception of credit risk
- Relationship between CDS and bond yields

### Case Study: Russia

**Timeline**: January-February 2022

**Market Events**:
- 10-year CDS: 2.54% (1/31/2022) → 4.04% (02/28/2022)
- 5-year CDS spike: 8.94% (2/24/2022)

**Analysis**:
- Geopolitical tensions drove significant spread widening
- Short-dated CDS showed greater volatility
- Market priced in increased default probability
- Timing coincided with military actions in Ukraine

## CDS Indexes

### Purpose and Structure

CDS indexes provide:
- Broad market exposure to credit risk
- Standardized reference portfolio
- Enhanced liquidity through trading
- Benchmark for credit market performance

### Major Index Providers

**His Markit** (now part of S&P Global) is a primary provider of:
- CDS index definitions
- Reference entity lists
- Market data and analytics
- Index performance calculations

### Index Characteristics

- **Composition**: Typically 125 or 250 most liquid single-name CDS
- **Rebalancing**: Regular updates to maintain liquidity and representativeness
- **Tranching**: Credit risk can be partitioned into different risk segments
- **Trading**: Both index products and index tranche products

### Applications

1. **Portfolio Management**: Efficient exposure to broad credit markets
2. **Benchmarking**: Measure credit market performance
3. **Hedging**: Protect against systematic credit risk
4. **Arbitrage**: Exploit relative value opportunities

## Market Observations

### Post-Crisis Evolution

Since the 2008 financial crisis, the CDS market has experienced:

1. **Regulatory Reform**: Enhanced oversight and standardized practices
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer exotic structures, focus on standard products
3. **Improved Transparency**: Better reporting and public data
4. **Centralization**: Increased use of clearing and electronic platforms

### Current Market Dynamics

- **Liquidity**: Concentrated in most liquid reference entities
- **Pricing**: More efficient price discovery through electronic platforms
- **Risk Management**: Enhanced counterparty risk management through CCPs
- **Integration**: Closer relationship with bond and loan markets

## Conclusion

Credit Default Swaps have evolved from complex OTC instruments to standardized, regulated derivatives with significant market depth. The growth in sovereign CDS usage, the importance of CDS indexes, and the increasing role of central clearing demonstrate the maturation of this market. Understanding the various types of CDS, market structure, and historical behavior is essential for effective credit risk management in modern financial markets.
