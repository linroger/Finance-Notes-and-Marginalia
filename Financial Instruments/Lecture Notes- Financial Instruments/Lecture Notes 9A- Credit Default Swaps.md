# Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps
### Financial Instruments

Observations about CDS
[John Heaton](../Assignments/PSET%205%20Financial%20Instruments.md)
The University of Chicago Booth School of Business

### Types of CDS,  Quantities

Types

- [Single-name CDS](.md): single [reference entity](.md) such as a corporation or sovereign
- [Multi-name CDS](.md): cover defaults in a reference [portfolio](../../Advanced%20Investments/An%20Asset%20Allocation%20Primer.md) such as a basic [credit default swap](../../Credit%20Markets/Credit%20Market%20Session%202.md) or a CDS index (typically an index of commonly negotiated [single-name CDS](.md))
Quantities:
- From BIS (2021): \$8.5 trillion notional at end of 2020. 1.5% of notional of all global [derivatives](../../Financial%20Markets/Financial%20Trading%20and%20Markets/Chapter%209%20Arbitrage%20and%20Hedging%20With%20Options.md).
- GFC likely reduced size we see even today
- $62\%$ now with central counterparties that act like exchanges.
- Increased size of sovereign CDS since GFC: 4% of total notional in 2007 to $14\%$ in 2020.
