[[Citi-Guide to Swaps|Swap Pricing]]: Discounted Cashflows  
# Common Swap Structures  
- [[Basis Swaps|Basis swap]] (i.e. floating/floating) is one of the basic building block in fixed/fixed and fixed/floating CCS. - A [[Basis Swaps|basis swap]] in this context is defined as the exchange of LIBORs in two different currencies with both initial and final exchange of principal. - Cost of a [[Basis Swaps|basis swap]] is quoted against USD LIBOR flat (e.g. USD LIBOR vs YEN LIBOR 17 bps) and is driven by [[Currency Appreciation and Depreciation|demand and supply]] of - ABC company has 3 year funding in JPY and is required to hedge exchange rate exposure created by this foreign [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] debt.

Fixed/Fixed Cross [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] Swap

- Compared to a full cross [[Forwards and Futures Notes|currency]] swap, a Principal-Only Swap (POS) costs less because a POS does not provide a hedge against exchange rate risks on [[Realized Returns|coupon payments]].   
Consider a 3-year USD/JPY sw wit - At maturity, company receives JPY principal and pays USD principal at current [[The Foreign Exchange Market Annotations|spot rate]] (in fact can be any agreed exchange rate).   
- Same as a long-dated [[Forward Points in Currency|forward contract]] of the company buying JPY and selling USD at current [[The Foreign Exchange Market Annotations|spot rate]].   
Due to the interest rate differential between JPY and USD, forward USD/JPY exchange rate is lower than [[The Foreign Exchange Market Annotations|spot rate]] (i.e. JPY at premium).   
The contract to buy JPY/sell USD forward at current [[The Foreign Exchange Market Annotations|spot rate]] has a positive value to the Company.   
- As a compensation to [[HBS Citigroup 2007-Financial Reporting And Regulatory Capital|Citibank]] (i.e. to make NPV = 0), the Company will need to pay a periodic coupon (either in USD or JPY) to [[HBS Citigroup 2007-Financial Reporting And Regulatory Capital|Citibank]].

- Consider a 3-year USD/JPY swap with only coupon exchanges.  
There are no principal exchanges. If the USD fixed rate is known, we can solve

- A Long-Dated Foreign Exchange (LTFX) contract is a Zero Coupon [[Forwards and Futures Notes|Currency]] & [[Primer on Interest Rate Swaps|Interest Rate Swap]] - Instead of exchanging coupons, at the time of dealing, the [[HSBC-Auto callable Barrier Notes with Step-up Premium|Principal amount]] on one set of cashflows is set so that the NPV = 0.
