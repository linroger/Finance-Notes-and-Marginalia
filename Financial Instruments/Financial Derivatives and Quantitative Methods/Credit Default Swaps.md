# [[Financial Engineering/8. Credit Modeling and Credit Derivatives|Credit Default Swaps]]

Abstract : Credit default swaps (CDS) are the most common type of credit derivative. This paper provides a brief history of the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]] and discusses its main characteristics. After describing the basic mechanics of a CDS,  I present a simple valuation framework that focuses on the relationship between conditions in the cash and CDS markets as well as an approach to [[Teaching Note 2-Futures Contracts|mark to market]] existing CDS positions. The discussion highlights how the 2008 [[8. Credit Modeling and Credit Derivatives|global financial crisis]] helped shape current practices and conventions in the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]],  including the widespread adoption of standardized coupons and upfront premiums and the increased reliance on centralized counter parties. I also address [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS indexes]]--focusing on their growing role as key indicators of investors’ attitudes toward [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]]--and briefly examine their behavior during periods of acute financial or economic dislocations,  including those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

# 1. Introduction and History

Credit default swaps (CDS) are,  by far,  the most common type of credit derivative. They are [[A Practical Guide for Actuaries and other Business Professionals.|financial instruments]] that allow the transfer of [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] among market participants,  potentially facilitating greater efficiency in the [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] and distribution of [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]]. In its most basic form,  a CDS is a contract where a “[[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]]” agrees to make periodic payments (the CDS “spread” or premium) over a predetermined number of years (the maturity or term of the CDS) to a “[[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]]” in exchange for a payment from the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] in the event of default by a “[[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]].” CDS premiums tend to be paid quarterly and are set as a percentage of the total amount of protection bought (the “notional amount” of the contract). CDS maturities generally range from one to ten years,  with the five-year maturity being particularly common.

Major dealers regularly disseminate quotes for credit default swaps. Along with risk spreads in the corporate bond market,  CDS quotes are now commonly relied upon as indicators of investors’ perceptions of [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] regarding individual borrowers and investors’ willingness to bear this risk. In addition,  quotes from the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]] are used as inputs in the [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] of other traditional credit products such as bank loans and [[Class Notes 2 – Corporate Bond Contracts|Corporate Bonds]],  potentially helping promote greater integration of the various segments of the credit market.

Broadly speaking,  there are two types of CDS: [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|Single-name CDS]] are contracts that name a single [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]],  such as a corporation or a sovereign borrower,  whereas multiname CDS reference more than one borrower. For instance,  a multiname contract could be written to cover defaults in a reference [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] (such as in the case of a basket [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]]) or,  as has been increasingly common over the past couple of decades,  be based on an index of commonly negotiated [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|single-name CDS]]. The latter are generally called [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS indexes]].

Historically,  credit default swaps have been mostly negotiated in a decentralized [[Interest Rate Derivatives-An Introduction to the  Pricing of Caps and Floors|over-the-counter market]]. As a result,  unlike exchanged-based markets,  there are no readily available historical aggregate volume or notional amount statistics that one can draw upon. Instead,  most discussions of the evolution of the market,  its size,  and activity tend to center on results of surveys of market participants and on anecdotal accounts by key market players. For instance,  the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) conducts a semiannual survey of dealers’ [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] activities around the world,  and that survey has included information on credit default swaps since 2004. Other surveys,  some of which have been discontinued,  go a little further back in the past,  but the [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] market is relatively young; it was virtually non-existent in the early 1990 s.

Based on data collected by the BIS (2021),  [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]] outstanding in the global [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] market totaled close to $\S8.5$ trillion at the end of 2020,  with a little more than half corresponding to index products—first bar in Figure 1. That said,  the [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] market is still small relative to the overall global [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] market: [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|Notional amounts]] outstanding in credit default swaps accounted for approximately 1.5 percent of [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]] in the global [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] market in late 2020. The [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]] would likely be larger today,  were it not for the 2008 [[8. Credit Modeling and Credit Derivatives|global financial crisis]] (GFC). Underlying factors contributing to the decline in [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]] outstanding since the crisis include,  initially,  heightened uncertainty about the regulatory environment,  risk aversion,  and increased use of netting/trade compression arrangements (Fitch Ratings,  2011,  and Wooldridge,  2019) and,  especially over the past several years,  greater reliance on central clearing (Aldasoro and Ehlers,  2018).

# 2. Main Market Participants

Approximately 62 percent of the [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]] outstanding of credit default swaps at the major [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] dealers surveyed by the BIS in 2020 corresponded to contracts with central counter parties,  which are exchange-like entities that act as a [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]] to every participating seller and a [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] to every participating buyer. It is quite remarkable that central counter parties are now such important participants in the global [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] market. These entities essentially came about as a response to widespread counter party [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] concerns that emerged during and after the GFC. Inter dealer contracts are also common and include CDS entered as part of a dealer’s market-making activities as well as contracts where a dealer is an end user of [[RISK NEUTRAL VALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS|credit derivatives]]. For instance,  a dealer that is also a commercial bank might enter into a contract as a way to hedge part of the [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] in its loan book.

Excluding inter dealer contracts and contracts between dealers and central counter parties,  provides a glimpse into the main (non-dealer) end users of credit default swaps (or at least those non-dealer end users who entered contracts with dealers,  as opposed to central counter parties). As shown in the second bar in Figure 1,  the main non-dealer end users include smaller (though still large) banks or securities firms that do not participate in the BIS surveys,  [[Basis Trade Explainer|hedge funds]],  insurance firms,  and other financial customers (a category that includes mutual funds) as well as non-financial customers. [[Basis Trade Explainer|Hedge funds]],  in particular,  have become increasingly important participants in the global [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] market over the past several years,  both in relative and absolute terms.

As a group,  non-dealer end users of credit default swaps have tended to be net sellers of default protection in their transactions with dealers. The main net sellers have been banks and securities firms,  insurers,  and mutual funds. Special-purpose vehicles were important sellers before the GFC,  but they have been less active in the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]] since (see Figure 1). Historically,  many of these have tended to view selling default protection as a way to increase the yield on their portfolios,  though,  especially for some insurance companies,  this view backfired very badly during the GFC. For instance,  risk exposures in protection-selling positions in credit default swaps were widely seen as having contributed to the nearcollapse of American insurer AIG at the height of the 2008 crisis. The AIG experience was a stark reminder of the different risks associated with protection-selling positions in the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]]. Reportedly,  AIG was a significant seller of protection in AAA-rated tranches of securities backed by subprime residential mortgages and other assets. But the bulk of AIG’s CDS-related woes did not stem from actual defaults in those tranches. Instead,  the company came under intense financial pressure in part as a result of recurring calls by its CDS counter parties for additional collateral as the [[Wellman Inc the Importance of Loan Covenants|credit quality]] of the referenced tranches was deteriorating rapidly amid the broader [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]] (Stulz,  2010).

# 3. Types of Reference Entities

Credit default swaps are written on both sovereign and non-sovereign entities. In practice,  however,  data from the BIS (2021) suggest that most contracts reference non-sovereign entities (approximately 86

Percent of the notional amount outstanding in 2020,  as shown in the third bar in Figure 1). Considering only CDS written on non-sovereigns,  approximately one-third of the [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]] outstanding at year-end 2020 corresponded to contracts that referenced only non [[Squam Lake Group Introduction|financial firms]]. Contracts that referenced only [[Squam Lake Group Introduction|financial firms]] accounted for roughly 23 percent of the [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]] outstanding in contracts referencing non-sovereign entities,  with multiname contracts that reference both financial and non [[Squam Lake Group Introduction|financial firms]] accounting for most of the remainder.

The share of CDS written on sovereigns rose in the years after the GFC,  from less than 4 percent of the [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]] outstanding in the global [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]] in 2007 to around 14 percent in 2020. For single-name credit default swaps,  the share of the sovereign sector went from around 6 percent in 2007 to close to one-third in 2020. Indeed,  despite the GFC’s adverse impact on the market,  [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]] outstanding in the sovereign segment of the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|single-name CDS]] market managed to nearly double between 2007 and 2013. In contrast,  [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]] outstanding in the overall [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|single-name CDS]] market shrunk by almost half over the same period (BIS,  2013).

CDS contracts written on emerging-market [[Global Fixed Income Markets|government debt]] remain a dominant segment of the sovereign [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]]. Indeed,  contracts that reference the sovereign debt of key emerging-market countries--such as Brazil,  Mexico,  and Turkey--are often cited as being among the most frequently negotiated in the sovereign sector of the global [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]]. Still,  rising concern about debt-to-GDP ratios and fiscal deficits in the aftermath of the GFC--related in part to the economic downturn that followed the crisis and the high budgetary costs of repairing national financial systems--likely contributed to increased investor interest in CDS written on the sovereign debt of a much broader set of countries,  including some advanced economies (Mahadevan,  Naraparju,  and Musfeldt,  2010).

The [[Uses of Interest Rate Swaps|sovereign debt crisis]] in Europe also played an important factor in a notable expansion of the sovereign [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]] to contracts that covered more than just the usual set of key emerging-market countries. Italy,  for instance,  was reported as one of the most frequently negotiated contracts during the height of the European crisis (Fitch Ratings,  2011). In fact,  the CDS curve for sovereign Italian debt widened dramatically during the [[Spreads|European sovereign debt]] crisis and--as shown in Figure 2--became inverted in late 2011,  with the one-year [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]] significantly wider than the fiveand ten-year spreads.

An inverted CDS curve typically signals heightened concern by market participants about the nearterm prospects of the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]. Abstracting from market frictions that might have otherwise distorted the shape of the Italian CDS curve in late 2011,  an inverted curve suggests that market participants believed at the time that the Italian government was facing formidable near-term challenges but that,  if those immediate hurdles could be overcome,  Italy would fare better down the road. In the end,  Italy’s most pressing challenges were indeed overcome. Its sovereign CDS spreads have narrowed considerably since,  and its sovereign CDS curve has returned to its normal upward-sloping pattern (dashed curve in Figure 2).

While the increased use of sovereign CDS written on the debt of some advanced economies in the aftermath of the 2008 and [[Spreads|European sovereign debt]] crises is notable,  the market for CDS contracts that reference the sovereign debt of countries with the highest credit ratings has mostly remained small and relatively illiquid. In general,  for these countries,  investors’ most pressing concerns are less about the risk of a “fundamental” default--where the government is simply unable to service or repay its debt--and more about the risk of a “technical” default triggered by a presumably rare and temporary disruption that could result in a delay of payments due (Boyar chen ko and Shachar,  2020). This observation suggests that movements in the sovereign CDS spreads for the most credit worthy countries should primarily reflect shifting market views on technical [[Default Risk and Credit Derivatives 183|default risk]].

A case in point is the United States,  where technical default risks have emerged occasionally because of sometimes-contentious negotiations around the U.S. government’s statutory ceiling on its own federal debt. For instance,  in 2011,  amid intense debt-ceiling discussions in Washington,  DC and a related downgrading of U.S. [[Global Fixed Income Markets|government debt]] by the credit-rating agency Standard and Poor’s,  one-year CDS spreads on U.S. sovereign debt did widen notably,  before narrowing back following the passing of the Budget Control Act of 2011,  which included provisions to raise the debt limit and reduce future federal deficits (Austin and Miller,  2011). While U.S. debt ceiling negotiations appear to have left some imprint on U.S. sovereign CDS spreads in the few years that immediately followed the 2011 episode,  a study by Boyar chen ko and Sachar (2020) points to a less tight connection in recent years. That study concluded that investor interest in U.S. sovereign CDS has diminished over the past few years,  with the market becoming less liquid and U.S. sovereign CDS spreads becoming a less reliable indicator of investors’ views on U.S. technical [[Default Risk and Credit Derivatives 183|default risk]].

# 3.1. Credit Quality of Reference Entities

Credit default swaps are written on [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]-grade (rated BBB or higher),  speculative-grade (rated BB or below),  as well as unrated [[Corporate Bonds and Loans|debt instruments]],  but contracts written on [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]-grade instruments correspond to the majority of the [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]] outstanding in the global [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] market. For instance,  as shown in the last bar in Figure 1,  [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]] outstanding in credit default swaps written on [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]-grade entities accounted for roughly 58 percent of the [[Pricing Interest Rate Swaps|notional amounts]] in global [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]] in 2020,  with the remainder being about evenly split between contracts written on speculative-grade instruments and instruments that either had an unknown credit rating or no credit rating (BIS,  2021).

The larger share of contracts written on [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]-grade entities may seem counter intuitive. After all,  one might have expected that protection buyers would be more interested in protecting themselves from their riskier debtors,  rather than from highly-rated borrowers. In part,  the preponderance of contracts written on [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]-grade instruments traces its roots to the early days of the [[RISK NEUTRAL VALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS|credit derivatives]] market,  when bank capital requirements set by regulators tended not to differentiate between lending to investmentand speculative-grade borrowers. For instance,  the terms of the 1988 Basel Accord called on financial regulators to require banks to hold the same amount of capital in reserve for monies lent to,  say,  an [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]-grade,  A-rated borrower as they would for a speculative-grade borrower. Nonetheless,  lending to the former yielded a lower [[Lecture 1- Probability Distributions of Returns|expected return]],  giving banks an incentive to free up the regulatory capital associated with loans to [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]-grade borrowers by buying protection in the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]].

But the treatment of [[Week 6 Assignment Review|bank regulatory capital]] and banks’ use of credit default swaps has changed dramatically since the 1988 Basel Accord,  especially after the GFC. Indeed,  even before the crisis,  the terms of the Basel II Accord provided for greater discrimination among differently rated borrowers for the purposes of setting [[Case Study of Northern Rock|regulatory capital requirements]]. This and other regulatory changes partly explain why,  as large as the market share of contracts written on [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]-grade instruments is today,  it is much smaller than it was in earlier times. For instance,  a survey run by Fitch Ratings (2003) reported that contracts written on [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]-grade instruments accounted for 92 percent of the [[RISK NEUTRAL VALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS|credit derivatives]] market in 2003 (compared to about 58 percent in 2020).

Issues unrelated to regulatory capital also help explain the rising share of contracts written on speculative-grade entities. Indeed,  respondents to a survey run by the British Bankers Association (2002) reported that they expected credit derivative uses directly related to regulatory capital management to eventually play a less prominent role in the evolution of the market. In part,  that view reflected the expectation that market participants would become more focused on using [[RISK NEUTRAL VALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS|credit derivatives]] as tools for overall [[The Impact of Option Strategies in Financial  Portfolios Performance|portfolio management]]. In addition,  protection buyers’ attention was expected to continue to shift

From regulatory to economic capital. As a result,  some market participants expected (correctly,  it turned out) that the market share of credit default swaps written on speculative-grade entities would increase.

# 4. Basic Mechanics of a Credit Default Swap

As an illustration,  consider a [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] where the two parties agree on a notional amount of $\S100$ million,  a [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]],  a term (the period covered by the contract),  and a [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]] of 40 basis points. In this case,  the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]] will pay $\S100{,  }000$ every quarter to the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]]. If no default by the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] occurs during the life of the CDS,  the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] simply pockets the premium payments. Should a default event occur,  however,  the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] becomes liable for the difference between the face value of the debt obligations issued by the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] and their recovery value. For instance,  assuming that the reference entities’ obligations are worth 20 cents on the dollar after default,  the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]]'s liability to the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]] in the event of default would be $\S80$ million. The contract is terminated once the seller fulfills its default-related obligation.

In the event of default by the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]],  a CDS can be settled physically or in cash,  with the settlement choice determined upfront when entering the contract. In a physically settled swap,  the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]] has the right to sell (deliver) a range of defaulted assets to the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]],  receiving as payment the full face value of the assets. The types of deliverable assets are also pre specified in the contract. For instance,  the contract may determine that any form of senior [[HBR Case Study- Oaktree|unsecured debt]] issued by the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] is a deliverable asset,  and thus any bank loan or bond that meets this criterion is a deliverable asset.

In a cash settled swap,  the counter parties may agree to poll market participants to determine the recovery value of the defaulted assets,  and the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] is liable for the difference between face and recovery values. The asset or types of assets that will be used in the poll are pre specified in the contract. In the earlier days of the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]],  [[Swaptions|cash settlement]] was more common in Europe than in the United States,  where,  by far,  the majority of CDS were physically settled. Since 2009,  however,  settlements in both the U.S. and Europe have increasingly happened through auctions involving the relevant defaulted instruments,  where the auctions generally determine a common [[Credit Markets Session 3|recovery rate]] for cash settling the contract. Auctions have become the standard settlement method in the global [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]].

The legal terms of [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] agreements are highly standardized and have been so for a long time. Indeed,  the adoption of standardized documentation for CDS agreements has played an important role in the development and increasing [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] of the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]]. The use of master agreements sponsored by the International Swaps and [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|Derivatives]] Association (ISDA) is a common market practice,  significantly reducing setup and negotiation costs. The standard contract specifies all the obligations and rights of the parties as well as key definitions,  such as which situations constitute a “[[Valuation of Credit Default Swaps|credit event]]”—a default by the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]—and how a default can be verified. Regarding the former,  CDS contracts generally allow for the following types of default events:

- Bankruptcy • failure to pay • debt moratorium • debt repudiation • restructuring of debt • acceleration or default

Some of these events are more common in contracts involving certain types of reference names. For instance,  moratorium and repudiation are typically covered in contracts referencing sovereign borrowers. In addition,  CDS contracts have historically been negotiated both with and without restructuring included in the list of credit events.

The maturity of a [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] does not have to match that of any particular debt instrument issued by the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]. The five-year maturity is especially common,  although it is possible,  and increasingly easier,  to terminate or unwind a [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] before its maturity (and this is commonly done) in order to extract or monetize the market value of the position. Typically,  unwinding a CDS position requires both parties in the contract to agree on the market value of the position. The party for whom the position has negative market value then compensates the other accordingly. Alternatively,  a party may be able to close out its position by assigning it to a third party,  but this generally requires the approval of both new counter parties.

# 5. Main Uses

As with any other derivative instrument,  credit default swaps can be used to either avoid or take on risk,  in this case [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]]. Protection buyers are [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] avoiders; protection sellers are [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] takers,  and,  of course,  the market would not exist without either of them. At the most basic level,  protection buyers use credit default swaps to buy [[Credit Default Swaps|default insurance]],  and protection sellers use CDS contracts as a source of income. In practice,  however,  market participants’ uses of credit default swaps go well beyond this simple insurance analogy.

# 5.1. Protection Buyers

Credit default swaps allow banks and other holders of credit instruments to hedge anonymously their exposure to the [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] associated with particular debtors. Thus,  while the credit instruments may remain in the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]]’s balance sheet—which may be important particularly to banks for client-relationship reasons—the associated [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] is transferred to the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] under the CDS contract.

Some market participants,  however,  may want to buy protection through credit default swaps even if they have no exposure to the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] in question. Buying protection is akin to [[Short Selling|shorting]] the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]'s debt—in that the market value of the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]]’s position would increase in the event of a subsequent deterioration in the [[Wellman Inc the Importance of Loan Covenants|credit quality]] of the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]].

# 5.2. Protection Sellers

For protection sellers,  the [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] market offers an opportunity to increase the yield on their portfolios or diversify their [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] exposure. Here again there is a straightforward analogy to selling traditional insurance policies. For as long as the events covered in the contract do not occur,  protection sellers receive a steady stream of payments that essentially amount to [[Credit Default Swaps|default insurance]] premiums.

Of course,  prospective protection sellers could,  in principle,  simply buy [[Corporate Bonds and Loans|debt instruments]] issued by the desired reference entities directly in the marketplace in order to earn a potentially higher yield or to benefit from greater [[2. Forwards, Swaps, Futures, and Options|portfolio diversification]]. Furthermore,  buying [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] through outright long positions in,  say,  [[Class Notes 2 – Corporate Bond Contracts|Corporate Bonds]] and loans,  has the advantage of not exposing one to counter party [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] in the CDS contract. This begs the question of what motivates someone to sell protection in the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]].

The largely unfunded nature of credit default swaps distinguishes them importantly from cash market instruments such as bonds and bank loans. For instance,  credit default swaps allow an investor to obtain,  say,  exposure to $\S10$ million worth of debt issued by the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] with essentially no initial capital outlay or at an upfront cost that is much smaller than the notional amount of protection provided by the contract. In contrast,  that same exposure would have required a sizable initial cash outlay by the investor if the exposure were obtained in the form of a direct purchase of the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]’s bonds or loans.

Of course,  if the investor could finance the cost of the outright purchase in the repo market for bonds or loans issued by the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]],  the transaction could also be characterized as one requiring little or no initial net cash outlay. In particular,  the investor would buy the bond or loan for its market price of,  say,  Y and immediately repo it out,  essentially using the bond or loan as collateral for a loan in the amount of Y. This repo-financed transaction may not work well in practice,  however,  because the repo market for [[Corporate Bonds and Loans|corporate debt]] is typically not that liquid.

Credit default swaps can also be used to create synthetic long positions in [[Corporate Bonds and Loans|corporate debt]]: Instead of holding the [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] assets outright,  one can simply sell protection in a CDS contract. This use of credit default swaps highlights the fact that,  in addition to their largely unfunded nature,  credit default swaps might be particularly attractive to investors when outright positions in [[Corporate Bonds and Loans|debt instruments]] issued by the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] are difficult to establish. Consider,  for instance,  a firm whose debt is closely held by a small number of investors. For an investor who wants to obtain [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] exposure to that firm,  but who cannot buy its [[Corporate Bonds and Loans|debt instruments]] directly in the cash market,  selling protection via a CDS contract becomes a potentially appealing alternative. Our financial intuition should tell us that,  at least in theory,  the income that the investor will

Receive under the CDS contract will be closely linked to the [[Preview of the Book|cash flow]] that it would have received if buying the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]'s debt directly.

# 5.3. CDS Spreads as Market Indicators

We have thus far focused on the main uses of credit default swaps strictly from the standpoint of those who participate in the [[RISK NEUTRAL VALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS|credit derivatives]] market. Not so obvious,  but potentially very important,  is the growing use by market participants and non-participants alike of [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] information from credit default swaps as indicators of market sentiment regarding specific reference entities and [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] in general. [[Credit Market Session 2|Credit default swap]] indexes,  in particular,  have become common barometers of conditions in the overall credit market-- please see section 8.

Indeed,  some market observers have even suggested that prices in the [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] market have a tendency to incorporate information more quickly than prices in the corporate bond market given that,  at times,  it may be easier to enter into swap positions than to buy or sell certain [[Class Notes 2 – Corporate Bond Contracts|Corporate Bonds]] and loans. Whether information truly is reflected first in the [[RISK NEUTRAL VALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS|credit derivatives]] or cash markets remains a point of empirical debate,  but the fact is that both investors and regulators have started to pay closer attention to signals sent out by the [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]].

# 6. Valuation Considerations

Valuing a CDS can be thought of as arriving at the value of the [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]] that would result in no money changing hands at the inception of the CDS contract. This spread is commonly called the “par [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]].” We can use a simple,  [[Static Option Replication|static replication]] approach to arrive at the par [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]]. That approach tells us that if we can devise a [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] made up of simple securities that replicates the cash flows and risk characteristics of the contract we want to price,  the price of that contract is,  in the [[Exercises|absence of arbitrage]] opportunities,  simply the price of setting up the [[Pricing Forwards, Futures, Bonds, Swaps, Swaptions, Caps and Floors under No-Arbitrage and Risk-Neutral Pricing|replicating portfolio]].

Following Bomfim (2002),  we will consider two stylized examples that provide some basic insights regarding the valuation of credit default swaps.

Example 1 : Let Rf denote the [[Tba and Specified Pools Markets|current coupon rate]] for a floating-rate note that is not subject to [[Default Risk and Credit Derivatives 183|default risk]],  and $\mathrm{Rf}{+}\mathrm{S}$ denote the coupon rate for an otherwise identical floating-rate note that is subject to [[Default Risk and Credit Derivatives 183|default risk]] (S is the [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|credit spread]]). An investor who is offered the choice of one of two portfolios:

- a [[Chapter 4 - Futures: Hedging and Speculation|long position]] in this risky floater combined with a short position in the riskless floater; • a protection-selling position in a CDS written on the issuer of the risky floater.

We assume that both floaters have the same maturity,  coupon dates,  and face values $\mathfrak{P}1$ each),  and that they sell at par immediately after their coupon payment dates. To keep things even simpler,  assume further that the [[Credit Markets Session 3|recovery rate]] on the risky floater is zero and that default can only occur immediately after the coupon payment dates. In addition,  we assume that the CDS position involves no upfront payments.

What are the cash flows associated with each [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]]? For as long as the issuer of the risky floater does not default,  the first [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] yields S every period. As for the second [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]],  the CDS has a [[Preview of the Book|cash flow]] of Scds every period,  where Scds is the CDS premium.

In the event of default,  the holder of the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] of floaters ends up with a short position in the riskfree floater,  which translates into a liability of $\S1$ ,  given that the floater is valued at par on its coupon payment dates. The [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] in the CDS is liable for the CDS payoff,  which is also worth $\S1$ . Thus,  when there is a default,  both portfolios have the same payoff.

Let’s pause here to make two key points:

- With time-varying [[Interest Rate Quotations|interest rates]],  the [[Static Option Replication|static replication]] argument outlined above would generally fail if,  instead of using floating-rate notes to replicate the [[RISK NEUTRAL VALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS|CDS cash flows]],  we had used fixed-rate notes. This is so because a fixed-rate note is not generally valued at par after it is issued and thus the liability of the short seller in the event of default could well be different from $\S1$ . • Neither [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] required a cash outlay when they were set up: The proceeds of the [[Short Selling|short sale]] of the riskless floater were used to finance the purchase of the risky floater,  and it costed nothing to enter into the CDS.

Given the same initial cost,  the same payoffs in the event of default,  and the same risk exposure of the CDS transaction and the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] of floaters,  it must be the case that the CDS and the floater [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] have the same [[Preview of the Book|cash flow]] in the absence of a default by the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]. This requires that Scds $\mathrm{=}\mathrm{S}$ . Thus,  under the conditions set out above,  the premium that should be specified in a CDS written on a given [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] is the same as the risk spread associated with a par floater issued by that entity.

Let’s now try to make our example a little more realistic. We have thus far ignored the fact that the first [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] ultimately has to be funded on the balance sheet,  whereas the CDS does not. This is where example 2 comes in.

Example 2 : Using the same notation and assumptions of example 1,  consider the following two scenarios:

- The investor finances the purchase of the risky floater,  by repoing it out,  paying the repo rate $_\mathrm{Rf+F}$ . (Alternatively,  we can think of $\mathrm{Rf}{+}\mathrm{F}$ as the rate at which the investor can obtain financing for the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]].) Assuming no default by the issuer of the risky floater,  the investor receives $\mathrm{Rf}{+}\mathrm{S}$ every period and pays out $\mathrm{Rf{+}F}$ to its repo counter party. In the event of default,  the risky floater becomes worthless,  and the investor ends up owing $\S1$ to its repo counter party. To sum up,  the investor's cash flows are: S-F (no default) and $_-\S1$ (default). • The investor sells $\S1$ worth of protection in a CDS written on the issuer of the same risky floater considered in the previous scenario. The cash flows associated with such a CDS position are: Scds (no default) and $.\S1$ (default).

Again,  notice that neither strategy required an initial cash outlay and both have the same payoff in the event of default. Thus,  in the [[Exercises|absence of arbitrage]] opportunities and market frictions,  it must be the case that they have the same payoff in the absence of default,  i.e.,  the CDS premium,  Scds,  must be the equal to the difference between the risky floater spread,  S,  and the investor's funding cost,  F:
$$
\mathrm{S_{cds}}=\mathrm{S}-\mathrm{F}
$$

Where the above differs from the result obtained from example 1 because we are now explicitly taking into account the fact that the first [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] has to be funded on the balance sheet of a leveraged investor whereas the CDS is an unfunded instrument.

To bring the discussion of the above examples even closer to the real world,  we should note the following: Although the above approach for [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] a CDS relied on rates on par floaters issued by the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]],  most [[Corporate Bonds and Loans|corporate debt]] issued in the United States are fixed-rate liabilities. In practice,  however,  one can circumvent this problem by resorting to the [[Chapter 37 - Equity Swaps|asset swap]] market. In particular,  the above examples can be made more realistic as illustrations of how to obtain an (approximate) value for the CDS premium if we (i) substitute the par floater spread,  S,  with the par [[Chapter 37 - Equity Swaps|asset swap]] spread associated with the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] and (ii) redefine Rf as a short-term [[A Guide to the Front End and [[Basis Swaps|Basis Swap]] Markets#[[Short-Term Rates and the Transition from LIBOR|London Interbank Offered Rate]] (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rate in order to conform with the quoting convention for asset swaps. This would lead to the following version of equation (1):
$$
\mathrm{S_{cds}}=\mathrm{S_a}
$$

 Scds = Sa

Where Sa is the [[Chapter 37 - Equity Swaps|asset swap]] spread associated with the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]].

# 6.1. CDS vs. Cash Spreads in Practice

In practice,  CDS spreads can vary substantially from the corresponding [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]’s [[Chapter 37 - Equity Swaps|asset swap]] or floater spread. For instance,  when Scds $>S a$ ,  market participants say that there is a positive “CDS-cash basis” for that [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]].
$$
{\mathrm{(CDS-cash~basis)}}\ ={\mathrm{(CDS~grad)}}\ \mathrm{-}\ {\mathrm{(par~associativity~spap~spred)}}
$$

 (CDS-cash basis) = ([[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]]) - (par [[Chapter 37 - Equity Swaps|asset swap]] spread)

CDS and [[Credit Spreads|asset swap spreads]] can diverge for a number of reasons,  including market segmentation and idiosyncratic supply and demand factors. For example,  in the earlier days of the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]],  instances of substantial positive bias were sometimes associated with strong demand by convertible bond investors for buying default protection against the issuers of those bonds. Those investors were focusing primarily on the cheapness of convertible bonds’ embedded equity call options while using the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]] to shed the [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] associated with the bonds.

Another factor that contributes to positive bias is the fact that participation in the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]] is limited either by some investors’ lack of familiarity with [[RISK NEUTRAL VALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS|credit derivatives]] or by regulatory restrictions and internal [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] policies of certain [[Chapter 4 Institutional Trading|institutional investors]]. In addition,  for some reference entities,  a CDS [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] premium,  reflecting the poorer [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] of the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]] relative to the cash (corporate bond) market for those entities,  may also be a factor leading to positive bias.

Other factors that could contribute to a nonzero CDS-cash basis include • [[Tba and Specified Pools Markets|cheapest-to-deliver]] feature of CDS contracts (for physically settled contracts),  • default-contingent exposure in asset swaps,  • accrued premiums in CDS contracts,  • funding risk in asset swaps,  • counter party [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]],  • [[Asset Backed Commercial Paper Understanding the Risks|liquidity risk]] differentials.

# 6.2. Counter party Credit Risk

In principle,  a significant consideration for purchasers of protection in the credit default swaps market is the [[Wellman Inc the Importance of Loan Covenants|credit quality]] of the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]]. The [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] may itself go bankrupt either before or at the same time as the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]. This is,  of course,  what is meant by counter party [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]]. As noted below,  market participants commonly use credit-enhancement mechanisms—such as the posting of collateral—to mitigate the effects of counter party [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] in the [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] of CDS contracts. In the absence of these mechanisms,  however,  and other things being equal,  the higher the [[Wellman Inc the Importance of Loan Covenants|credit quality]] of a given [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] relative to other protection sellers,  the more it can charge for the protection it provides.

Regarding its [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] counter party,  the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]] is subject to two types of risk: Should the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] become insolvent before the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]],  the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]] is exposed to “replacement risk” or the risk that the price of [[Credit Default Swaps|default insurance]] on the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] might have risen since the original default swap was negotiated. The [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]]'s greatest loss,  however,  would occur when both the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] and the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] default at the same time,  and hence the importance of assessing the extent of [[Copulas and the Modeling of Default Correlatio|default correlation]] between the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] and the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]].

# 6.3. Collateral iz ation and Netting

As the [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] market has grown,  so have market participants' exposures to one another. An important step that market participants took early on to reduce counter party [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] is to require the posting of collateral against the net exposures resulting from CDS positions. Collateral,  primarily cash,  is commonly adjusted daily to reflect the net marked-to-market value of the CDS positions between two counter parties (see section 6.5 for a discussion of a simple marking-to-market approach). Typically,  when both counter parties are dealers--or even for a non-dealer counter party that is active in many sectors of the [[Chapter 9 Arbitrage and Hedging With Options|derivatives]] market--collateral arrangements tend to be more complex,  in that they will cover net exposures on all over-the-counter derivative positions,  not just CDS.

Note that the focus is on “net” exposures between counter parties,  and,  indeed,  this netting of counter party [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] exposures is an important feature of market functioning. Consider a simple example. AZZ Bank and XYZ Bank have a large number of credit default swaps between the two of them. AZZ's total exposure to XYZ amounts to $\S100$ billion,  whereas XYZ's exposure to AZZ is $\S90$ billion. Netting means that the exposures of the two banks to one another are offset before any collateral is posted so that what matters in the end is the $\S10$ billion net exposure of AZZ to XYZ. This would be the only amount against which any collateral would be calculated,  and this would be the claim that AZZ would have on XYZ in the event of a default by XYZ.

Taken together,  early adoption of collateral iz ation and netting practices,  along with standardized documentation,  have had the effect of helping overcome some of the “growing pains” of the [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] market. While standardized documentation has helped reduce legal risk and transaction costs,  collateral iz ation and netting have eased concerns about counter party [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]],  especially as potential risk exposures through [[RISK NEUTRAL VALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS|credit derivatives]] have grown.

# 6.4. CDS-Implied Credit Curves

Thus far,  our main input for determining the fair value of a [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]] has been [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] information from other credit instruments,  such as par [[Credit Spreads|asset swap spreads]] and par floater spreads. Certain reference entities,  however,  may not have marketable debt outstanding,  or the market for their debt may be very illiquid and available quotes may be uninformative.

An alternative approach to valuing credit default swaps that is especially useful when reliable market prices on related instruments are not available is the one based on [[Credit Risk Models and the Valuation of Credit  Default Swap Contracts|credit risk models]]. Suppose we have a model that gives us the [[Credit Markets Session 3|default probabilities]] associated with a given [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]. Consider now the simple case of a one-year CDS with a $\S1$ notional amount and a single premium payment,  Scds,  due at the end of the contract. Assume further that a default by the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]],  if any,  occurs only at the maturity date of the contract. (To keep things even simpler,  assume no counter party [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] and no market frictions such as il [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] or market segmentation.)

Let’s start with a [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] that has zero market value at its inception,  which means that the [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]] is such that the value of the “protection leg”—defined as the present value of the expected payment made by the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] in the event of default by the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]—is equal to the value of the “premium leg”—defined as the present value of the premium payments made by the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]].

The current value of the protection leg is simply the present value of the premium:
$$
\mathrm{PV}(\mathrm{permutations})=\mathrm{PV}(\mathrm{Sets})
$$

 PV (premiums) = PV (Scds)

where $\mathrm{PV}(.)$ denotes the present value of the variable in parenthesis.

To arrive at an expression for the protection leg,  define w as the probability that the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] will default in one year's time. The [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] will have to pay (1-X) with probability w and 0 otherwise,  where X is the [[Credit Markets Session 3|recovery rate]] associated with the defaulted instrument. Thus,  we can write the present value of the protection leg as:
$$
\mathrm{PV(photo)}=\mathrm{PV(w~[1-X])}
$$ 

If the CDS is to have zero market value at its inception,  the present values in equations (4) and (5) must be equal,  and that will happen when

And we get the result that the cost of protection,  Scds,  is increasing in the probability of default and decreasing in the [[Credit Markets Session 3|recovery rate]] associated with the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]. In particular,  in the limiting case of no recovery,  the CDS premium is equal to the probability of default. Thus,  if we have a theoretical model that gives us the [[Credit Markets Session 3|default probabilities]] associated with the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]],  we can price a CDS written on that entity accordingly.

The above results can be easily generalized,  with a few modifications,  for more realistic cases,  such as multi-period credit default swaps. In particular,  let $\mathrm{Q(t,  T_{j})}$ denote the risk-neutral probability,  as of time t,  that the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] will not default by a future time $\mathrm{{T_{j}},  }$ where $\mathrm{Q(t,  T_{j})}$ is conditional on all information available at time t and,  naturally,  on the issuer not having defaulted by time t. More generally,  for any given issuer or [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]],  one can imagine an entire [[The Vasicek Model|term structure]] of survival probabilities,  which is one way of thinking of that entity’s [[Advanced Usage of QuantLib analytics library|credit curve]].

Consider now a CDS with a notional amount of $\S1$ ,  written at time t on this [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]],  and with premium payment dates at $[\mathrm{T}_{1},  \mathrm{T}_{2}\ldots,  \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{n}}]$ . Let $\mathrm{{S_{n}}}$ be the corresponding annualized CDS premium. For simplicity,  assume that,  in the event of default,  the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] will pay (1-X) at the premium payment date immediately following the default,  where $\mathrm{X}$ ,  restricted to be between 0 and 1,  is the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]’s [[Credit Markets Session 3|recovery rate]].

As noted above,  we can think of a CDS as having two “legs:” The premium leg is made up of the periodic payments made by the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]]; the protection leg is the default-contingent payment made by the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]]. Assuming that the occurrence of defaults is independent of the riskfree interest rate embedded in the prices of riskless bonds,  the present discounted value of the premium leg can be written as:
$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{PV}(\mathrm{permutations})=\sum_{j=1}^{n}Z(\mathrm{t},  \mathrm{T_{j}})\;\mathrm{Q(\bar{t}},  \mathrm{T_{j})}\;\delta_{\mathrm{j}}\;\mathrm{S_{n}}}\end{array}
$$ 

where $Z(\mathrm{t,  T_{j}})$ is the time-t price of a riskless zero-coupon bond that matures at $\mathrm{{T}_{j}}$ with a face value of $\S1$ ,  and $\delta_{\mathrm{j}}$ is the accrual factor for the j th premium payment (the number of days between the $(\mathrm{\ddot{j}}\!-\!1)^{\mathrm{th}}$ and j th premium payment dates divided by the number of days in the year,  based on the appropriate [[Intra-Year Compounding and Day-Count|day-count]] convention).

Equation (7) shows that there are two elements to discounting future premiums. When computing the present value of a future payment,  first,  there is the time-value of money,  captured by $Z(\mathrm{t},  \mathrm{T_{\mathrm{j}}})$ ,  and,  second,  one must take account of the fact that a future premium due,  say,  at $\mathrm{{T}_{j}}$ will only be received if the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] has not defaulted by then,  and,  conditional on all information available at time t,  the risk-neutral probability of that happening is Q (t,  T j ).

The present value of the protection leg can be written in a similar way:
$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{PV(photo)}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}Z(\mathrm{t,  T_{j})\ P r o b[T_{j-1}<\tau\leq T_{j}]\ [1-X]}}\end{array}
$$ 

where $\tau$ is the time of default,  and $\mathrm{Prob}[\mathrm{T_{j-1}}<\tau\leq\mathrm{T_{j}}]$ denotes the probability,  conditional on information available at time t,  that the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] will default between $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{j}\cdot1}$ and $\mathrm{{T}_{j}}$ . The intuition behind (8) is straightforward: One does not know whether and when a default will occur,  but there is some probability $\mathrm{Prob}[\mathrm{T_{j-1}}<\tau\leq\mathrm{T_{j}}]$ that the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] will default during the interval $[\mathrm{T_{j-1},  T_{j}}]$ ,  in which case the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] would have to pay (1-X) at $\mathrm{{T}_{j}}$ ,  which is worth $Z(\mathrm{t,  T_{j}})$ (1-X) in today's dollars. As a result,  the present value of the protection leg of the CDS is the probability-weighted sum of all possible default scenarios. We can then write:
$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{PV(photo)}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}Z(\mathrm{t,  T_{j})\Omega[Q(t,  T_{j-1})-Q(t,  T_{j})]\Omega[1-X]}}\end{array}
$$ 

Equations (7) and (9) allow us to write an expression for the par [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]]:
$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{S_{n}}=\!\!\{\sum_{j=1}^{n}Z(\mathrm{t,  T_{i}})\,  \left[\mathrm{Q(t,  T_{j-1})-Q(t,  T_{i})}\right]\,  \left[\mathrm{1-X}\right]\}\,  \,  /\,  \,  \{}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}Z(\mathrm{t,  T_{i}})\,  \,  \mathrm{Q(t,  T_{j})}\;\delta_{i}\}}\end{array}
$$
$$
\sum_{j=1}^{n}Z(\mathrm{t,  T_{i}})\,  \left[\mathrm{Q(t,  T_{j-1})-Q(t,  T_{i})}\right]\,  \left[\mathrm{1-X}\right]\
$$$$
{\sum_{j=1}^{n}Z(\mathrm{t,  T_{i}})\,  \,  \mathrm{Q(t,  T_{j})}\;\delta_{i}\}}
$$

Our starting point for arriving at equation (10) was model-based estimates of the [[Credit Markets Session 3|default probabilities]] of the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]. But we can turn this process the other way around. In particular,  suppose we see quotes for CDS spreads for a given [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] for contracts with maturities ranging from $\mathrm{T}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{T_{n}}$ . In this case,  and assuming we know the risk-free discount factors $Z(\mathrm{t,  T_{j}})$ ,  for $\overset{\cdot}{\underset{\mathrm{~j~}}{}}=1$ to n,  we can use (10) to “bootstrap” the CDS-implied risk-neutral survival probabilities of the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]. For,  instance,  starting with j $=\!1$ ,  $\mathrm{Q(t,  T_{1})}$ is easily computed as $(1{\cdot}\mathrm{X})/(1{\cdot}\mathrm{X}+\delta_{1}\:\mathrm{S}_{1})$ ,  which can then be used to compute $\mathrm{Q(t,  T_{2})}$ ,  and so on.

# 6.5. Marking to Market a CDS Position

The market value of a CDS position varies over time,  mostly reflecting changes in how the market assesses the credit worthiness of the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]. Marking a CDS position to market is [[The Dodd Frank Act and Its Impact|the act]] of determining today’s value of a CDS agreement that was entered into at some time in the past.

Consider,  for instance,  a [[Credit Market Session 2|credit default swap]] that was written one year ago,  with an original maturity of five years. Suppose that the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] is a corporation that was perceived to have a substantially more favorable profit outlook one year ago (and hence higher survival probabilities) than today. As a result,  we assume that the CDS premium that was written into the year-old contract is substantially lower than the one that would be written into a brand-new contract today. Under these circumstances,  the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] in the year-old contract is collecting a premium that is well below the going market rate. This contract then has negative market value to the seller of protection. The [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]],  on the other hand,  is holding a contract with positive market value as she is paying well below the premium she would pay if setting up a brand-new contract today.

How can we value the year-old contract? One simple approach is to think of the problem of valuing the year-old contract as that of computing its “replacement cost.” To put it simply,

replacement cost $=$ value of new contract - value of old contract

Assuming that the newly minted four-year contract was negotiated such that it has no market value at its inception---that is,  the new contract calls for a [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]],  $\mathrm{S_{4}},  $ that is equal to the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]’s par [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]]. Given the above expression,  this means that the replacement cost of the old contract is simply the negative of its current market value. After some simple manipulations,  and assuming (for simplicity) that the premiums are paid annually,  we can write the value (to a [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]]) of the year-old contract (which had an original maturity of 5 years) as:
$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{Time-t~value~of~year-old~contact}=\sum_{j=1}^{4}Z(\mathrm{t,  T_{j})~Q(t,  T_{j})~}\delta_{j}\;[\mathrm{S_{4}-S_{5,  \mathrm{old}}}]}\end{array}
$$ 

where $\mathrm{S_{5,  old}}$ is the [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]] written into the year-old contract,  which now has a remaining maturity of four years.

# 7. Effects of the Global Financial Crisis on CDS Market Conventions

In many ways,  the GFC left a lasting imprint on the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]]. We have already mentioned the growing importance of central counter parties in the global [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]] in the post-crisis environment. We discuss below two additional post-crisis innovations: the widespread use of standardized coupons and upfront premiums (which also had the effect of facilitating the rise of central counter parties) and the growing popularity of [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS indexes]].

# 7.1. Upfront Payments and Standardized Coupons

The simple examples addressed thus far assumed that the CDS contract had no market value at its inception. As we discussed above,  the [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]] for such a contract is such that,  at the time of the contract’s inception,  the present value of the protection leg of the swap is equal to the present value of the premiums leg.

Contracts with zero market value at inception were the norm in the years before the 2008 crisis. Back then,  it was generally the case that only contracts written on reference entities that were viewed as potentially headed for trouble in the near term required upfront payment of a portion of the protection premiums. The upfront payments helped attract protection sellers to a market that could otherwise be severely one-sided,  especially if the entities referenced in those contracts were perceived as being subject to “jump-to-[[Default Risk and Credit Derivatives 183|default risk]].” 8

Since the 2008 crisis,  however,  contracts involving upfront payments have become standard,  and not just because of jump-to-default considerations. Indeed,  a major driver of the shift to upfront payments was a push for further standardization of contract terms and practices in the global [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]]. An important part of that push was the adoption of a fixed [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]] and predetermined payment dates for all reference entities in a given class. For instance,  in North America,  standard CDS contracts written on high-grade corporates generally specify a fixed spread of 100 basis points,  regardless of the characteristics of the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]. Contracts written on corporates in the high-yield sector generally specify a spread of 500 basis points.

To see how upfront payments relate to coupon standardization,  consider the case of a high-yield corporate that is perceived to be sufficiently risky that its par [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]] is significantly higher than the standard 500 basis points specified in the contract. In this case,  a CDS contract with the standard premium would require an upfront payment from the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]] to the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] in order to compensate the latter for a contract-specified spread that is essentially too low. (The upfront payment would flow in the opposite direction if the par [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]] were perceived as being lower than the standardized spread specified in the contract.)

# 7.2. Valuing Upfront Payments

At its most basic level,  valuing an upfront payment comes down to marking to market a CDS contract whose premium is set to a predetermined (standardized) value,  instead of the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]’s par [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]]. To make the point a little more concrete,  let Sstd denote the standardized spread written into the contract. Using the same logic followed above to [[Teaching Note 2-Futures Contracts|mark to market]] an old CDS position,  we can write the market value (to the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]]) of this brand-new CDS contract with a standardized spread of Sstd and a par spread of Spar as

Equation (12) says that the upfront payment from the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]] to the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]] is equal to the present value of the difference between two premium payment streams,  one associated with the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]’s par [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]],  Spar,  the other with the standardized coupon written into the contract,  Sstd. Again,  if the standardized coupon happened to be above the par [[Cds-Equivalent Bond Spread|CDS spread]],  in which case the market value to the buyer would be negative,  the upfront payment would flow from the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] to the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]].

# 7.3. Standardized Coupons and Central Clearing

Standardized coupons have facilitated the central clearing of CDS trades and made it easier (less costly) for market participants to close or unwind existing CDS positions. As such,  they have enhanced the overall [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] of the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]].

For instance,  from a dealer’s perspective,  the unwinding of a CDS position by an end user generally results in transferring (assigning) that position to the dealer,  with the dealer seeking to hedge the risks in its newly acquired position by entering into at least one offsetting position on the same [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] with another counter party. With standardized spreads,  the dealer’s cost of [[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|hedging]] the position acquired from the end user is generally lower than with non-standardized spreads. In particular,  there is no [[Preview of the Book|cash flow]] mismatch for the dealer between the old and new contracts,  which helps limit the dealer’s exposure to risks associated with the timing of an eventual default by the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]]. Ultimately,  the lower cost of [[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|hedging]] for the dealer translates into a lower cost of unwinding the position for the end user,  with the end result being enhanced [[Trading and Liquidity|market liquidity]].

Without standardized spreads,  the [[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|hedging]] position sought by the dealer would typically involve a very different spread from the one in the contract acquired from the end user. For instance,  if position acquired from the end user involves a coupon that is substantially lower than the one received in the newly entered [[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|hedging]] position,  the dealer would be exposed to the risk of a sudden default by the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]],  which would cut short the stream of higher CDS payments embedded in the [[Key Rates O1s Durations and Hedging|hedging]] position.

# 8. CDS Indexes

[[Credit Market Session 2|Credit default swap]] indexes are a relatively recent addition to the [[RISK NEUTRAL VALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS|credit derivatives]] market. The earliest versions of [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS indexes]] were introduced in 2001. Since then,  especially after the 2008 [[Squam Lake Group Letter|financial crisis]],  index products have become an increasingly important segment of the [[RISK NEUTRAL VALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS|credit derivatives]] market,  reaching close to 42 percent of the global notional amount outstanding by mid-2013—Bank for International Settlements (2013).

In its simplest form,  a CDS index can be thought of as a [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] of the most actively transacted [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|single-name CDS]] contracts in each segment of the market. Indeed,  for an [[Fundamental Indexing|equal-weighted index]],  the index par spread should be sufficiently close to the average of the individual par spreads associated with the index’s constituents. In practice,  however,  [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] and [[Currency Appreciation and Depreciation|demand and supply]] factors can drive a wedge between the valuation of the index and that of its components.

# 8.1. The Mechanics of the CDX. NA. IG Index

We will use the Markit North American CDX [[An Asset Allocation Primer|Investment]] Grade Index—CDX. NA. IG—to illustrate how [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS indexes]] generally work. CDX. NA. IG is one of the most actively traded [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS indexes]]. It is an equalweighted index that tracks the 125 most liquid [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|single-name CDS]] contracts transacted in North America,  provided the credit rating of the constituent reference entities is at least “BBB-“ or “Baa 3.” Once the constituents of a given vintage (“series”) of the index are chosen,  the composition of that series remains fixed,  as long as there are no defaults among the constituents. Buying and selling the CDX. NA. IG index is akin to selling and buying a [[An Asset Allocation Primer|portfolio]] of [[Corporate Bonds and Loans|debt instruments]] issued by the reference entities included in the index. Coupon conventions for an index generally are the same as for its constituent single-name contracts.

The composition of CDX. NA. IG is refreshed every six months,  at which point a new index “series’’ is generated. For instance,  in late 2014,  series 23 of CDX. NA. IG—or CDX. NA. IG. 23—was the on-the-run index. Older series—CDX. NA. IG. 22,  CDX. NA. IG. 21,  etc.—continue to trade until their maturity date,  but [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity]] tends to migrate to the on-the-run series.

Credit events related to a given index generally follow the definitions and procedures specified in the [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|single-name CDS]] contracts that make up the index. For instance,  for CDX. NA. IG,  the relevant credit events are [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] and failure to pay. We will use a simple numerical example to illustrate how a default by an index constituent is handled. Let’s start with a position in CDX. NA. IG with a total notional amount of $\$ 10$ million. As noted above,  CDX. NA. IG is an equal-weight index,  which means that each constituent corresponds to $1/125$ of the position,  or a notional amount of $\$ 80{,  }000$ per constituent in this case. A default by one of the index components would trigger the following changes:

- The weight of the defaulted entity in the index falls to zero. • The total notional amount of the position in the index falls by $1/125$ ,  to $\$ 9.92$ million. • The index weight of each remaining constituent increases to $1/124$ ,  reflecting the fact that each non-defaulted constituent still corresponds to a notional amount of $\$ 80{,  }000$ .

A default by an index constituent would also trigger a payment from the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] in the index position to the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection buyer]],  just as it would be the case in a [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|single-name CDS]]. Suppose the [[Credit Markets Session 3|recovery rate]] associated with the defaulted [[Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps|reference entity]] is 45 percent. Assuming that the position is cash settled,  the [[Credit Default Swaps|protection seller]] would have to pay $\$ 44{,  }000$ to the protection buyer,  or (1-. 45) $_{\textrm{x}80,  000}$ . The newly reweighted index continues to trade until its maturity date,  though it would still be subject a further adjustments in the event of additional defaults among its constituents.

# 8.2. CDS Indexes as Market Indicators

[[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS indexes]] make it easier for investors and market observers to obtain exposure to,  or simply track,  a specific sector of the credit market. Focusing on the North American [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]-grade sector,  Figure 3 shows the evolution of the CDX. NA. IG index since 2004,  highlighting a few key episodes of financial and macroeconomic stress. Not surprisingly,  the GFC had a profound effect on [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]] [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] in the United States,  resulting in a broad,  steep,  and persistent widening in spreads that was first particularly noticeable in early 2008,  around the time of the collapse of the [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]] bank [[The Fall of Bear Stearns|Bear Stearns]] and its immediate acquisition by [[WSJ-Excerpts From the Lehman Report|J.P. Morgan]] Chase.

It would not be until mid-2014 when the CDX. NA. IG index narrowed to levels close to its pre-GFC range,  although the [[Spreads|European sovereign debt]] crisis did play a significant role in slowing the U.S. investmentgrade sector’s recovery from the GFC. In particular,  by the spring of 2010,  investors were becoming increasingly worried that problems associated with a worsening fiscal picture in Europe--mostly focused on [[PSET 3 Solution-Financial Instruments|Greece]] and a few other so-called peripheral EU countries at the time--could eventually hurt global growth prospects,  with negative spillover effects for the U.S. corporate sector. The fiscal outlook for Europe

darkened further in 2011,  spreading beyond the periphery--as illustrated by the inversion of the Italian sovereign CDS curve later that year (Figure 2)--and the cost of buying default protection in the U.S. corporate sector rose markedly in late 2011.

Following the resolution of the [[Spreads|European sovereign debt]] crisis,  the U.S. [[Corporate Bonds and Loans|corporate debt]] market enjoyed a period of relatively calm that was only briefly interrupted by a bout of [[Turmoil in Financial Markets the Risk Business|financial market turmoil]] in China around early 2016 and rising [[International Trade Banking and Capital Markets Lecture Notes|global trade]] frictions in late 2018. It took the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020 for CDS spreads in the U.S. [[An Asset Allocation Primer|investment]]-grade sector to really spike again,  but that spike was short lived. One interesting aspect of the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]] reaction to the economic effects of the pandemic was the different behavior of the costs of buying default protection in contracts that referenced consumer-facing businesses,  such as airlines,  relative to those that referenced producers of consumer goods. For instance,  while CDS spreads in both the consumer-goods and consumer-services sectors widened markedly in the earliest stage of the pandemic,  CDS spreads for consumer-facing reference entities took longer to recover,  consistent with changes in consumer spending patterns at the time that resulted in a shift towards goods consumption and away from services consumption.

# 9. Concluding Remarks and the Use of CDS in the Literature

The market for credit default swaps is still relatively young but has already become an integral part of the global credit market. Market participants actively use CDS to adjust their risk exposures as well as to infer evolving market views on [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]]. In addition,  there is a growing academic and practitioner literature on credit default swaps. That literature has examined a range of CDS-specific issues,  including the role of counter party [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] in the determination of par CDS spreads (Hull and White,  2000); how quickly new information is reflected in the [[Copulas and the Modeling of Default Correlatio|CDS pricing]],  relative to other markets (Tolikas and Topaloglou ,  2017),  and the degree of integration between the cash and CDS markets in developing economies (Chan-Lau and Kim,  2005). These are just a few of the topics that are ripe for further investigation in the professional literature. Other paths for further research include the use of [[Arbitrage Pricing of Derivatives|pricing]] data from the [[Credit Derivative Indexes|CDS market]] to examine broader questions,  such as the cost of sovereign defaults (Hebert and Schreger,  2017) and the systemic and countryspecific nature of [[Quantitative Trading Strategies Lecture Notes|credit risk]] in the U.S. and Europe (Ang and Longstaff,  2013).
